Supplement History Table 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances and resolutions have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances and resolutions that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances and resolutions that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
    In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

3.12.100 - Additional local sales and use tax. 
A.  Findings. The city council (the "council") of the city of Woodland, Washington (the "city"), hereby makes the following findings and determinations: 
1.  The Washington Legislature has recently amended RCW 82.14.450 to authorize cities to submit a proposition to local voters approving a sales and use tax increase so long as at least one-third of the money received under the new taxing authority is used for criminal justice purposes as defined under RCW 82. 14.340, fire protection purposes, or both, and fifteen percent is distributed to Cowlitz and Clark Counties. 
2.  Pursuant to Ordinance No. 1216, enacted by the Council on August 1, 2011 (which ordinance by this reference is incorporated herein) (the "ballot ordinance"), a proposition was submitted to the qualified voters of the city for their approval or rejection at a general election held therein on November 8, 2011, to authorize the city to fix and impose pursuant to RCW 82.14.450 an additional sales and use tax of one-tenth of one percent (the "additional sales and use tax") and for the city to use its share of the resulting proceeds to construct and equip a new police facility with a multi-purpose community meeting room (the "project") and to pay other criminal justice and fire protection costs, and that proposition was approved by the requisite number of voters. 
3.  The council finds that the city has satisfied all prerequisites to imposing the additional sales and use tax, including without limitation, the conditions set forth in RCW 82.14.450 and the ballot ordinance. 
4.  Prior to January 1, 2012, the city intends to incur general indebtedness, and to issue bonds to finance the project. The city further intends to retire such indebtedness in whole or in part from the additional sales and use tax revenues that it receives. 
B.  Additional Sales and Use Tax Imposed as of April 1, 2012. 
1.  Effective Date and Duration. The additional sales and use tax shall be imposed and become effective as of April 1, 2012 (or the earliest practicable date therefor provided under RCW 82.14.055). The additional sales and use tax shall: (a) be in addition to other sales and use taxes currently imposed by the city; (b) be imposed on all taxable events as authorized under Chapters 82.08 and 82.12; RCW and (c) not apply to any exempt transactions identified in RCW 82.14.450(4). The additional sales and use tax imposed under this ordinance shall expire only after all bonds, refunding bonds, and any other indebtedness issued by the city for the purpose of financing the costs of the project (collectively, the "bonds") are repaid, redeemed or defeased. However, if revenue from the additional sales and use tax is insufficient to pay annual debt service relating to the project, the city may continue to levy the additional sales and use tax until its general fund has been repaid. 
2.  Use of the Additional Sales and Use Tax Receipts. At least one-third of all proceeds from the additional sales and use tax shall be used for criminal justice purposes as defined in RCW 82.14.340, fire protection purposes, or both. Fifteen percent of the additional sales and use tax collected by the State Department of Revenue shall be distributed to Cowlitz and Clark Counties on a per capita basis and used for criminal justice purposes, fire protection purposes or other purposes authorized by RCW 82.14.450. The remaining eighty-five percent shall be paid to the city and used to pay the costs of the project, including the costs of issuing the bonds. If in any year the city receives revenue from additional sales and use tax in excess of the principal and interest payments due on the bonds in that year, the city may use the excess revenue for other criminal justice or fire protection purposes.

The planning commission shall submit an annual report to the council for each school district for which school impact fees are collected. 
C.  Council Action. No new or revised school impact fees shall be effective until adopted by the council following a duly advertised public hearing to consider the school district's capital facilities plan or plan update. 
D.  Interlocal Agreement. School impact fees shall not be collected on behalf of any school district until such district enters into an interlocal agreement with city providing for submittal of capital facilities plans, fund administration, report of expenditures, allocation of risk and other appropriate matters. The interlocal agreement may include a fee to cover the city's cost of administering the school impact fee program. 
(Ord. 925 § 1 (part), 1999) 
3.40.060 - School impact fee. 
    The impact fee for schools shall be calculated using the following formula: 

A.  "SIF" means the school impact fee. 
B.  "CS" means the cost of each type of facility listed in a school district's capital facilities plan attributable to new growth divided by the capacity of the improvement needed for growth for each type of school facility. Each type of facility means elementary school, middle school and high school. 
C.  "SF" means student factor. The student factor is the number of students typically generated from one residential unit for each type of school facility. This is determined by dividing the total number of residential units in a school district into the current enrollment numbers for each type of school facility. The student factor for each school district shall be calculated annually. As provided for in Section 3.40.050 separate student factors shall be calculated for single-family and multifamily dwelling units. 
D.  "SM" means state match State match is that amount received from the state toward school construction costs. The state match component of the formula is that amount representing the per student amount of state matching funds. This is calculated for each type of facility as: student factor times Boeckh index (average annual construction cost of a school facility per square foot) times square foot standard per student established by the superintendent of public instruction times state match percentage (that percentage of the total cost of a school facility funded by state funds). The state match for a school district shall be calculated annually. 
E.  "TC" means tax credit. This is calculated as: 
(1 + i) 10 )-1/I(1+i) 10 
X average assessed value for the dwelling unit capital property X current school district within a school district tax levy rate  
where i = the average annual interest rate as stated in the Bond Buyer Twenty Bond General Obligation Bond Index. The tax credit for a school district shall be calculated annually. 
F.  "FC" means facilities credit. This is the value of any improvements listed in a school district's capital facilities plan provided by the developer. 
G.  "A" means an adjustment for the portion of the anticipated increase in the public share resulting from exempt residential development proratable to new residential development. This adjustment for school impact is determined to be eighty-five percent.

In the event the land, improvements and/or facilities are accepted by the school district, the feepayer shall be responsible for supplying an independent appraisal based on objective standards which indicates the fair market value of the dedicated land, improvements and/or facilities. The credit amount shall be applied to the impact fee calculated for the particular development pursuant to Section 3.40.060. If the amount of the credit is less than the amount of the fee, the feepayer shall pay the difference. In the event the amount of the credit exceeds the amount of the impact fee due and owing by the feepayer, neither the school district nor the city shall be liable to the feepayer for the difference.

3.41.050 - Computing required impact fees using adopted impact fee schedules. 
    At the option of the person applying for the building permit or undertaking the development activity, the amount of the impact fees may be determined by the fee schedules in this section. 
A.  When using the impact fee schedules, the impact fees shall be calculated by using the following formula: 
Number of units of each use x Impact Fee amount for a facility type = Amount of Impact Fee that shall be paid for that facility type for that use  
1.  The number of units of each use determined as follows: (i) for residential uses, it is the number of housing units for which a building permit application has been made, and (ii) for office, retail, or manufacturing uses, it is the gross floor area of building(s) to be used for each use expressed in square feet divided by one thousand square feet. If uses other than parking vehicles which do not constitute a stock in trade and uses accessory to residences will take place outside of buildings, the calculations shall include the land area on which these uses will take place. 
2.  Using the formula in subsection (A), impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use and each facility type. The impact fees that shall be paid are the sum of these calculations. 
3.  If a development activity will include more than one use in a building or site, then the fee shall be determined using the above schedule by apportioning the space committed to the various uses specified on the schedule. 
4.  If the type of use or development activity is not specified on the impact fee schedules in this section, the clerk-treasurer shall use the impact fee applicable to the most comparable type of land use on the fee schedules. The clerk-treasurer shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the most recent Standard Industrial Code Manual. If the clerk-treasurer determines there is no comparable type of land use on the above fee schedule then he/she shall determine the proper fee by considering demographic or other documentation which is available from state, local, and regional authorities. 
5.  In the case of a change in use, development activity, redevelopment, or expansion or modification of an existing use, the impact fee shall be based upon the net positive increase in the impact fee for the new development activity as compared to the previous development activity. The clerk-treasurer shall be guided in this determination by the sources and agencies listed above. 
(Ord. 1059 § 1 (part), 2005) 
3.41.060 - Computing required impact fees based on an independent fee calculation. 
    If a person required to pay impact fees decides not to have the impact fees determined according to the method as referenced in this chapter, then the person shall prepare and submit to the clerk-treasurer an independent fee calculation study for the proposed development activity. Any person can decide to have an independent fee calculation study for one or more impact fees and use the impact fee schedules referenced in this chapter for one or more impact fees. 
A.  Any person submitting an independent impact fee calculation study shall include the fee set by the city council for reviewing independent impact fee calculation studies. This fee may be set by ordinance or resolution. 
B.  The independent fee calculation study shall comply with the following standards: 
1.  The study shall follow accepted impact fee assessment practices and methodologies. 
2.  The study shall use acceptable data sources and the data shall be comparable with the uses and intensities proposed for the proposed development activity. 
3.  The study shall comply with the applicable state laws governing impact fees including RCW 82.02.060 or its successor. 
4.  The study, including any data collection and analysis, shall be prepared and documented by professionals qualified in their respective fields. 
5.  The study shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made. 
C.  The clerk-treasurer shall consider the study and documentation submitted by the person required to pay the impact fees, but is not required to accept the study if the clerk-treasurer decides the study is not accurate or reliable. The clerk-treasurer may, in the alternative, require the person submitting the study to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. If the clerk-treasurer decides that outside experts are needed to review the study, the applicant shall be responsible for paying for the reasonable cost of a review by outside experts. If an acceptable independent fee calculation study is not presented, the person shall pay the impact fees based upon the process and schedules referenced in this chapter. If an acceptable independent fee calculation study is presented, the clerk-treasurer may adjust the fee to an appropriate amount. 
(Ord. 1059 § 1 (part), 2005) 
3.41.070 - Credits. 
    A feepayer can request that a credit or credits be awarded to him or her for the value of dedicated land, improvements or construction provided by the feepayer if the land, improvements and/or the facility constructed are included within the adopted capital facilities plan and the city council by motion makes the finding that such land, improvements and/or facilities would serve the goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan. In the event the council passes such a motion, the feepayer shall be responsible for supplying an independent appraisal based on objective standards which indicates the fair market value of the dedicated land, improvements and/or facilities. The credit amount shall be applied to the impact fee calculated for the particular development. If the amount of the credit is less than the amount of the fee, the feepayer shall pay the difference. In the event the amount of the credit exceeds the amount of the impact fee due and owing by the feepayer, the city shall not be liable to the feepayer for the difference. 
(Ord. 1059 § 1 (part), 2005)

(Ord. 1059 § 1 (part), 2005) 
3.41.110 - Review and revision. 
    Impact fees shall be reviewed by the city council as it may deem necessary and appropriate or in conjunction with the annual update of the capital facilities plan element of the city's comprehensive plan. Impact fee rates shall be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in costs of land acquisition and construction, facility plan projects and anticipated growth. Such adjustments shall only become effective upon adoption by the city council of a modification to the capital facilities plan; provided, however, that the capital facilities plan may contain a provision for automatic revision of an impact fee rate no more often than annually to reflect the change in a generally recognized and applicable inflation/deflation index. 
(Ord. 1059 § 1 (part), 2005) 
3.41.120 - Modification of fee. 
A.  The city upon application by a developer supported by studies and data, may reduce or eliminate such fee if it is shown that: (1) the formulae contained in this chapter does not accurately reflect actual impact; or (2) due to unusual circumstances where: (a) facility improvements identified for the applicable service area are not reasonably related to the proposed development, or (b) such facility improvements will not reasonably benefit the proposed development. 
B.  Prior to making an application for a building permit or site plan approval, an applicant, upon payment of the applicable fee, may request an impact fee determination from the city, which determination shall be based upon information supplied by the applicant sufficient to permit calculation of the impact fee. The impact fee determination shall be binding upon the city for a period of one year unless there is a material change in the development proposal, the capital facilities plan or this chapter.

D.  "C" means a "credit" for the developer's contributions, in the form of easements, dedications or payments in lieu of fees, toward traffic system improvement projects identified in the Woodland CFP. Credits may be approved by the city if the review authority finds that the value of the land or improvements for which a credit is sought is accurately documented and that the contribution substantially furthers the completion of a street improvement identified in the Woodland CFP. 
E.  Using the formula above, transportation impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use. The transportation impact fees that shall be paid are the sum of these calculations. 
F.  If a development activity will include more than one use in a building or site, then the transportation impact fee shall be determined by apportioning the space committed to the various uses specified and computing trips for each use from the Trip Generation Manual, Institute of Transportation Engineers. 
G.  In the case of a change in use, development activity, redevelopment, or expansion or modification of an existing use, the transportation impact fee shall be based upon the net positive increase in the impact fee for the new development activity as compared to the previous development activity. The director shall be guided in this determination by the sources and agencies listed above.

D.  Once a project is placed on Attachment A, a fee shall be imposed on every development that impacts the project until the project is removed from the list by one of the following means: 
1.  The council by ordinance removes the project from Attachment A, in which case the fees already collected will be refunded if necessary to ensure that transportation impact fees remain reasonably related to the traffic impacts of development that have paid an impact fee; provided, that a refund shall not be necessary if the council transfers the fees to the budget of another project that the council determines will mitigate essentially the same traffic impacts; or 
2.  The transportation impact fee share of the project has been fully funded, in which case the director shall administratively remove the project from the project list.

(Ord. No. 1178, § 2(A), 4-5-2010) 
3.60.060 - Use of city credit cards.

B.  Eligibility. All regular-status city employees and city officers/officials are eligible to receive a purchasing/credit card if authorized by their department head and the clerk-treasurer. Purchasing/credit cards may be checked out by the clerk-treasurer department to those city officials/officers and employees who are authorized to obtain a card because their job responsibilities would be facilitated by the use of a purchasing/credit card and such use would benefit the city. The act of obtaining a city purchasing/credit card does not indicate pre-approval of expenses. 
C.  Establishment of Card Limits. The clerk-treasurer shall set a monthly credit limit on the purchasing/credit card not to exceed ten thousand dollars per cardholder and pursuant to purchasing policy. No single purchase on the purchasing/credit card shall exceed the purchasing policy limit without prior approval of the city council.

It may not be used as a substitute for professional service agreements, public works contracts and/or human services contracts.

The card is not intended to replace effective procurement planning which can result in quantity discounts, reduced number of trips and more efficient use of city resources. 
5.  The only person entitled to use the purchasing/credit card is the person who has been issued the card. Cards should be treated with extreme care in the same manner as a personal credit card. The cardholder will be responsible to report a lost or stolen card immediately to the clerk-treasurer.

E.  City Procedure. 
1.  If, for any reason, disallowed charges are not repaid by the cardholder before the statement is due, the city shall retain a prior lien against and a right to withhold any and all funds payable to the cardholder up to the amount of the disallowed charges and interest at the same rate as charged by the purchasing/credit card. 
2.  Finance charges will not be paid by the city. If the statement and receipts are not submitted to the purchasing card administrator by the due date, the purchasing/credit card limit will be set to zero until the information is received.

F.

3.64.020 - Small works roster. 
    The city of Woodland utilizes the small works roster program through Municipal Research and Service Center (MRSC). 
A.  In lieu of the formal bidding procedures for public works projects as set forth in RCW 35.23.352(1) and code cities follow 35A.40.210, the city may use the small works roster process provided in RCW 39.04.155 and in this section to award public works contracts with an estimated value of three hundred thousand dollars or less or per current state law. The city elects to use the roster provided by Municipal Research and Service Center small works program in exercising this authority. 
B.  In the event the MRSC roster is unavailable or does not satisfy legal requirements or the city finds that it is in the city's best interest to do so, the city may develop its own roster in accordance with Washington law, either creating a single general small works roster or creating small works rosters for different categories of anticipated work. If an internal process is chosen vs. the MRSC process then the small works roster or rosters shall be created as follows: 
1.  At least once a year the city clerk treasurer shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the city a notice stating the existence of the small works roster or rosters and soliciting the names of contractors for such roster or rosters. In addition, responsible contractors shall be added to an appropriate roster or rosters at any time they submit a written request and necessary records. 
2.  The small works roster or rosters shall consist of all responsible contractors who have requested to be on the list and are properly licensed or registered to perform such work in this state. 
C.  Each city department that desires to use the small works roster process without advertising for bids shall do the following: 
1.  Invite written, electronic, or telephone quotations from all contractors on the general small works roster, or a specific small works roster for the appropriate category of work, to assure that a competitive price is established and to award contracts to the lowest responsible bidder as defined in RCW 43.19.1911 and of this chapter. 
2.  Alternatively, quotations may be sought from at least five contractors on the appropriate roster who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being sought. 
3.  If the alternative process is used, the city should distribute the invitations for quotations in a manner that will equitably distribute the opportunity, that is, not favor one contractor over another. If the estimated cost of the work is from one hundred fifty thousand dollars to three hundred thousand dollars and the city chooses to solicit bids from less than all the appropriate contractors, it must notify the other contractors. At the city's sole option, such notice may be by (a) publishing notice in a legal newspaper in general circulation in the city; (b) mailing a notice to those contractors; or (c) sending notice to those contractors by facsimile or other electronic means. 
4.  Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished; detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitation. 
5.  Whenever possible, the city must invite at least one proposal from a minority or woman contractor who must otherwise qualify under this section.* [] 
6.  After the bids have been submitted, the city will award the contract to the contractor with the lowest responsible bid. 
7.  Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by written, telephonic, or electronic request. 
8.  At least once every year, the city will make a list of the contracts awarded available. The lists must contain the name of the contractor, the amount of the contract, a brief description of the public work, and the date of the award. 
9.  Small works roster procedures are "in lieu of the procedures" for competitive bids on public works projects. Therefore, specific requirements, such as those relating to advertising for bids or regarding bid deposits, required by RCW 35.23.352(1), are not mandatory for small works roster contracts. Performance bonds are prescribed in RCW 39.08.030, not RCW 35.23.352(1) or RCW 35.22.620; therefore, they are required on small works roster projects, even though bid bonds are not. Since the work will be performed by contract, the requirement to pay prevailing wages remains. Although not required, bid bonds are recommended to ensure that the contractor enters into the contract. 
(Ord. No. 1178, § 2(B), 4-5-2010) 
Footnotes: 
--- () --- 
* RCW 39.04.160. In view of the passage of Initiative 200 in 1998, it is not clear that this requirement is enforceable, as it could be construed as "preferential treatment." An issue paper from the Attorney General's office dated October 16, 1998, however, suggests that a court may distinguish such an outreach program, one which merely expands the pool of qualifying participants, from the use of selection goals, one which merely expands the pool of qualifying participants, from the use of selection goals, which more likely is a form of preferential treatment. 

3.64.030 - Limited public works process. 
A.  In lieu of the small works roster process set forth in this chapter, the city may award a contract for work, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement project estimated to cost less than thirty-five thousand dollars using the limited public works process provided in RCW 39.04.155 and in this section. 
B.  For limited public works projects, the city shall solicit electronic or written quotations from a minimum of three contractors from the appropriate small works roster and shall award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder as defined under RCW 43.19.1911 and of this chapter. After an award is made, the quotations shall be open to public inspection and available by written, telephonic, or electronic request. 
C.  The city shall attempt to distribute opportunities for limited public works projects equitably among contractors willing to perform in the city. 
D.  For limited public works projects, the city may waive the payment and performance bond requirements of Chapter 39.08 RCW and the retainage requirements of Chapter 60.28 RCW, thereby assuming the liability for the contractor's non-payment of laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, material men, suppliers, and taxes imposed under Title 82 RCW that may be due from the contractor for the limited public works project. However, the city shall have the right of recovery against the contractor for any payments made on the contractor's behalf.

The city must evaluate the information submitted by the potential bidder and respond before the bid submittal deadline. If the evaluation results in a change of the criteria, the city must issue an addendum to the bidding documents identifying the new criteria. 
5.  If the bidder fails to supply information requested concerning responsibility within the time and manner specified in the bid documents, the city may base its determination of responsibility upon any available information related to the supplemental criteria or may find the bidder not responsible. 
6.  If the city determines a bidder to be not responsible, the city must provide, in writing, the reasons for the determination. The bidder may appeal the determination within the time period specified in the bidding documents by presenting additional information to the city.

(Ord. No. 1178, § 2(B), 4-5-2010) 
3.64.060 - Change orders on construction contracts. 
A.  In accordance with the terms and conditions of this section, the mayor, clerk-treasurer and the director of public works are hereby authorized to approve and sign construction contract change orders on construction contracts, if the change order does not substantially change the scope of the project and if the total contract amount as adjusted by the change order is within the amount budgeted for the project.

(Ord. No. 1178, § 2(B), 4-5-2010) 
Chapter 3.68 - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES 

3.68.010 - General information. 
    The city of Woodland uses the Washington State Auditor's Office prescribed budgetary, accounting and reporting system (BARS) for local governments. 
A.  Funds. Funds are used to account and record designated information. A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts recording cash and other financial resources, together with all related liabilities and residual equities or balances, and changes therein, which are segregated for the purpose of carrying on specific activities or attaining certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions, or limitations. 
B.  Fund Types. 
1.  General Government. General government funds are accounted for on a modified accrual basis of accounting. Following are the general government funds used by the city. 
2.  General Fund. The general fund is used to account for revenues that are not designated for specific activities or programs. 
3.  Special Revenue. The city will establish and maintain special revenue funds used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources to finance specific activities which are required by statute, ordinance, resolution, or executive order. 
4.  Debt Service. The debt service fund accounts for the payment of principal and interest on general long-term debt associated with the general government. It does not include the payment of principal and interest on debt created by an enterprise fund. 
5.  Capital Projects. This fund is used to account for financial resources and expenditures incurred for the purchase of land, purchasing or constructing buildings and structures used for general purposes, acquisition or construction of street improvements, park development, and cemetery improvements. It also includes the development and updating of capital improvement plans associated with these projects. This fund does not include capital projects associated with an enterprise fund. 
C.  Proprietary/Enterprise Funds. Enterprise funds account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private businesses, where the cost for providing services to the general public are recovered primarily through user fees. Enterprise funds are used for water, sewer and storm water facilities. Debt service is accounted for in the appropriate operating fund and capital projects are accounted for in the utility capital projects fund. Enterprise funds are maintained on a full accrual basis of accounting. 
(Ord. No. 1211, § 1, 7-18-2011) 
3.68.020 - Budget management. 
A.  General. Department directors have primary responsibility for formulating budget proposals in accordance with city council and mayor priority direction, and for implementing the budget once they are adopted. 
The clerk-treasurer department is responsible for conducting the overall preparation and administration of the city's budget. This includes providing information on revenues and expenditures, updating costs and revenues, organizing data in an understandable fashion, and creating and providing tools for budget development. 
The clerk-treasurer department assists department management in identifying budget problems, formulating solutions and alternatives, and implementing any necessary corrective actions. 
The budget is prepared and implemented on an annual basis in accordance with RCW 35A.33. 
Budgets are developed and used for the general, special revenue and enterprise funds of the city. Budgets are also used in the debt service fund to account for principal and interest payments and in the capital project fund to account for capital expenditures and associated capital funding sources. 
B.  Adjustments and Amendment Process. 
1.  Budget adjustments are needed when: 
a.  Total expenditures in a fund will exceed the total budget for that fund; 
b.  Revenue sources increase or decrease for a fund, and if revenues are projected to be less than budget, the corresponding expenditures for the fund must also be adjusted accordingly; or 
c.  Departments request authorization to allocate funds for an item or activity that was not included in the original budget. 
2.  Adjustments or amendments to the budget proceed as follows: 
a.  The clerk-treasurer department receives a request for a budget adjustment from a department or through council action. Budget changes can also occur based on new information or documentation that the clerk-treasurer department receives. 
b.  The clerk-treasurer department can process changes, with the approval of the mayor or clerk-treasurer, if the requested adjustment does not change the total budget for the fund. 
c.  Council approval is required if the requested adjustment changes the total budget for a fund. The clerk-treasurer department will verify whether there are sufficient resources for the adjustment, and prepare a budget adjustment and ordinance for council approval. 
C.  Monitoring. Budgets are developed and monitored at the line item level, but are managed at the fund level. A manager can overspend on one line item as long as it is balanced out by an under expenditure on another line item. The total expenditures for a fund cannot exceed the total budget for the fund. 
Department heads are responsible and accountable for their department budget. 
Monthly reports that compare budget to actual will be created by the clerk-treasurer department and provided to the appropriate manager for review and response if large discrepancies are identified. 
(Ord. No. 1211, § 2, 7-18-2011) 
3.68.030 - Revenues. 
    The city will strive to maintain a diversified and stable revenue system to shelter it from short-term fluctuations in any one revenue source. 
    The city will work to develop and maintain sustainable revenue sources to ensure its viability over the long term. 
    Revenue estimates adopted by city council should be made with consideration to the sensitivity of both local and regional economic activities. 
    The city will establish all user charges at a level associated with the cost of providing the service. 
    The city will set fees and user charges for each enterprise fund, such as water, sewer and garbage, at a level that fully supports the total direct and indirect cost of the activity. 
    Grant sources of revenue will be acquired and used whenever possible. 
(Ord. No. 1211, § 3, 7-18-2011) 
3.68.040 - Expenditures. 
    The city will only propose operating expenditures that can be supported by ongoing operating revenues. 
    The city will maintain a level of expenditures consistent with the level of services that will meet the goals and mission of the city. 
    Expenditures funded by one-time only sources, such as grants, must be identified and noted as such. Expenditures funded by these sources will be eliminated once the funding source no longer exists. 
    The city will maintain expenditure categories according to state statute and administrative regulation.

3.68.060 - Fund balance. 
A.  Fund balances are created and maintained to provide capacity to: 
1.  Offset significant downturns in the economy. 
2.  Provide sufficient cash flow to meet daily financial needs at all times. 
3.  Meet all statutorily required reserve funds to guarantee debt service. 
4.  Maintain ability to meet scheduled equipment repair and replacement that sustains city services at an acceptable level and prevents physical deterioration of city assets, as budget allows. 
5.  Provide the capacity to pay large unanticipated expenses, such as the payment of vacation and sick leave balances for employees that retire or leave employment with the city. 
B.  Fund balance is defined as the amount of total resources that exceed total expenditures that results from the activity associated with the operations and functions of a fund. A positive fund balance should be maintained to properly manage a fund. 
C.  Reserves are a portion of the fund balance that is restricted or categorized to use for a designated purpose. The following definitions (through the city may not use all of these categories at one time) are published by the Government Accounting Standards Board-Pronouncement No. 54: 
1.  Non-spendable: Amounts that cannot be spent due to form; for example, inventories, prepaid amounts, long-term and notes receivables, and other restricted items. Also includes amounts that must be maintained intact legally or contractually. 
2.  Restricted: Amounts constrained for a specific purpose by external parties, or constitutional provision, such as a requirement for revenue bonds to set aside funds in a debt service reserve account. 
3.  Committed: Amounts constrained or restricted for a specific purpose by a government using its highest level of decision-making authority. Action by the legislative authority is required to remove or change this amount. 
4.  Assigned: Used for funds to classify any remaining positive amounts not identified as non-spendable, restricted or committed. These amounts should not result in a deficit in unassigned fund balance. 
5.  Unassigned (remaining fund balance that is not reserved): This is the excess or residual amount of resources that exceed the amount expended, less amounts identified as non-spendable, restricted, committed or assigned. If the residual amount is negative, the assigned amount should be reduced accordingly. 
D.  The city has determined the need to create the following reserves and fund balances with the priority identified: 
1.  Priority #1: General Unassigned Fund Balance: (001-General fund). 
a.  Purpose: This is the fund balance that remains after allocating to a reserve account and is used by any fund that budgets operating expense activities in the fund. The purpose of this account is to create the financial ability to cover operating expenses during short term revenue shortfalls or temporary downturns in the economy. Revenue receipts are cyclical in nature, such as the first major receipt of property taxes comes in April, some utility taxes are paid quarterly, and water usage and consequent receipt of these revenues is higher during the summer, however, expenses are normally more evenly disbursed throughout the year. 
b.  Amount: The goal is to maintain an amount equal to (three months) of the annual operating expenses incurred for a fund. 
The allocation will come from the amount of annual operating revenue that exceeds the annual operating expenses for a fund. 
c.  Category: Identified as "unassigned" fund balance. 
2.  Priority #2: General Assigned Reserve: (Fund 001-General). 
a.  Purpose: This reserve sub-account will be used by any fund that budgets operating expense activities in the fund. The purpose of this account is to create the financial ability to pay for large "one-time" expenses, such as the payout of vacation and sick time for employees that leave city service, cover major unexpected police investigations, or to pay for large building repairs. This reserve can also be used to cover operating expenses during temporary, yet more long-term, economic downturns. 
b.  Amount: The amount allocated will be based upon the annual financial forecast model and/or during the annual budget process. Efforts will be made to build this fund up to the established amount through the annual budget development process. The amount will come from a portion of the annual operating revenue generated in the fund that pays for these types of expenses. 
c.  Category: Identified as "assigned" reserved portion of fund balance. 
3.  Priority #3: Equipment Repair and Replacement Reserve: (Fund 304-Equipment Acquisition Reserve). 
a.  Purpose: This reserve account will be used by any general fund department that budgets equipment repair and replacement as an expense item in its fund, or uses a capital projects fund to budget these expenses or uses a designated equipment, repair and replacement fund. The purpose of this account is to create the financial ability to pay for these types of expenses that include computer systems, vehicles, roads, parks, building maintenance, and general facilities, as they occur and deemed necessary to properly manage city equipment. 
b.  Amount: The amount allocated will be one percent of annual sales tax or as determined by the need identified in an updated financial forecast model and/or during the annual budget process. 
c.  Category: Identified as a "committed" reserve portion of fund balance. 
4.  Priority #4: Capital Project Reserve: General: (Fund 301). 
a.  Purpose: This reserve account will be used by general fund departments that budget capital and/or large maintenance projects as an expense item in the fund or uses a capital projects fund to budget and pay for these expenses. The purpose of this account is to create the financial ability to pay for these types of projects, identified in the Capital Facilities Plan, as deemed appropriate to meet community needs and properly manage city infrastructure. 
b.  Amount: The amount allocated is ten percent of annual sales tax and real estate excise tax 1st quarter percent and 2nd quarter percent pursuant to RCW 35.43.040, 82.46.010(2), 35.43.040 or will be determined by the need identified in an updated financial forecast model and/or by the department director. 
c.  Category: Identified as a "committed" reserve portion of fund balance. 
5.  Priority #5: Capital Project Reserve: Utilities: (Fund 302). 
a.  Purpose: This reserve account will be used by proprietary/enterprise funds that budget capital and/or large maintenance projects as an expense item in the fund or uses a capital projects fund to budget and pay for these expenses. The purpose of this account is to create the financial ability to pay for these types of projects, identified in the capital facilities plan, as deemed appropriate to meet community needs and properly manage city infrastructure. 
b.  Amount: The amount allocated is through water and sewer assessments and transfers in from the water and/or sewer fund or will be determined by the need identified in an updated financial forecast model and/or by the department director. 
c.  Category: Identified as a "committed" reserve portion of fund balance. 
The city will make every effort to create and maintain the fund balances and reserves identified above and based on the priorities established. The city is aware that needs may change over time and fund balance reserve amounts may be redistributed within a fund to meet the needs that occur at a given time. If it is determined that funds need to be redistributed within a fund, the fund balance with the lowest priority will be redistributed first to allow the ability to meet the need of a higher priority fund balance. In all cases, council approval or budget enactment is required before changing or redistributing the amounts allocated to a reserve account.

A.  The city has an established set of addresses for properties. Future annexations and infill properties will match with the abutting properties that already have existing addresses. 
B.  Properties developed shall be further divided on the basis of twenty blocks to the mile, except in those instances where a different base is already in effect, and the blocks so developed shall be further divided to provide an address every twenty-five feet, or such other division necessary to provide continuity in addressing. 
C.  The dividing lines between blocks above developed shall be numbered progressively from the addresses previously developed and shall be numbered progressively from the block lines. For new subdivisions and streets, addresses located on the north and west of block lines shall end in odd numbers and those located on the south and east of block lines shall end in even numbers. Addresses of properties in existing areas will match with the existing numbering system on that street. 
D.  Roads running east and west shall be designated as "avenues" and identified with the number of the nearest east-west block lines. 
E.  Roads running north and south shall be designated as "streets" and identified with the number of the nearest north-south block line. 
F.  Roads running east and west between the streets shall be designated as "ways" and identified with the number of the preceding block line or street.

(Ord. No. 1307, § 1, 10-6-2014) 
12.30.025 - The system of numbering for multi-tenant and multiple structure complexes. 
    This section shall govern the numbering of units and buildings within all multiple tenant commercial and residential developments in the city. An address number shall be assigned to each primary building except for situations where public safety or consistent numbering is better achieved by single addresses for complexes of multiple buildings. All numbering systems shall be subject to review and approval by public works staff prior to construction. 
A.  Multiple Dwellings in a Single Building. Where there are multiple dwelling units in a single building, as with a duplex, triplex and so forth, unit numbering shall depend upon whether the individual units have separate entrances that face the street, or whether the primary entrance(s) to the building or units face an off-street parking lot. The following subsections are intended to provide guidance and the public works director, in consultation with emergency service providers, shall have the ultimate authority to review and possibly modify the final addressing system. 
1.  Single Entrance or Units Face Off-Street Parking Lot. Where the individual units share a single entrance, or if the entrance(s) to the building or units face an off-street parking lot, then the building shall have a single street address, and each unit shall be numbered as described in subsection B of this section. 
2.  Units with Separate Entrances that Face the Street. Where the individual units have separate entrances and the entrances face the street, each unit shall have a separate street address number, and the numbering shall be consistent with the regular numbering along the street. If the building is multi-storied and individual unit numbers do not present a clear and easy-to-find addressing system for emergency service providers, then the public works director may require a single street address with separate unit numbers as provided in subsection (A)(1) of this section. 
B.  Multiple Dwellings in a Multiple Building Complex. Where there are multiple dwellings in a complex consisting of multiple buildings, the complex shall be assigned a single street address. Individual buildings within the complex shall be assigned a different letter starting with the first building to the right as you enter the complex, which shall be designated with the letter "A." The letters shall continue sequentially in a counter-clockwise direction. The letters shall be at least twenty-four inches high, be a contrasting color, and be affixed on the side of the building near the building's main entrance. Each unit within the complex shall be numbered individually and sequentially with no repeated numbers. In multiple level buildings, ground level numbers shall be preceded by a one, second level number shall be preceded by a two, etc. For example, the first unit on the ground floor of building "A" should be A-101. A unit approximately above this first unit should be A-201. Each unit shall have the unit number posted near the point of entry to the unit. These numbers shall be prominently displayed pursuant to the Woodland Municipal Code. 
1.  If the number of units in a complex varies from one level or building to the next, the numbering of subsequent buildings shall continue from the highest preceding number as if all intervening numbers had been assigned to every floor. 
2.  A recreational building shall be lettered but shall not be assigned a unit number unless there are two or more recreational buildings in the complex. 
3.  Directory signs listing building addresses shall be located at all public street entries to multiple building and multiple tenant complexes. Directory signs are subject to the requirements of Woodland sign code. 
C.  Mobile Home Parks. A primary street address shall be assigned to a mobile home or manufactured dwelling park consisting of leased lots. Space numbers beginning with No. 1 shall be assigned to individual spaces or units within the park beginning with the first space or unit to the right as you enter the park. Numbers shall continue sequentially in a counter-clockwise direction. The number of each unit shall be prominently displayed on each unit or space pursuant to the city of Woodland Municipal Code. 
D.  One Organization in Multiple Buildings. Multiple buildings that house a single business, school, or other organization shall be assigned a single street address based on the main driveway location. Each building shall be assigned a letter with the same requirements described in subsection B of this section. Directory signs shall be located at all public street entries and are subject to the requirements of the Woodland sign code. 
E.  Multiple Tenant Buildings with Flexible Floor Plans. For multiple tenant commercial buildings with flexible floor plans and where units or tenants do not have individual exterior entrances, i.e., suite assignments and access is from interior hallways, public works staff may permit a single address for the building. Where tenants or units have their own individual outside entrances, a range of unit numbers will be assigned that accommodates potential future expansions. A master plan for addressing a complex may be created, but individual address assignments will be at the discretion of public works staff. 
1.  Suite numbers shall be in ascending order but need not be consecutive. Gaps should be left in the numbering sequence to allow for the addition of units and suites in the future. 
2.  In multiple level buildings, ground level numbers shall be preceded by a one; second level numbers shall be preceded by a two, etc. Suite numbers shall not repeat themselves. For example, the first suite number on the ground floor should be 101. 
3.  Directory signs which list building addresses, unit numbers and tenant names shall be located at all public street entries to multiple tenant complexes and are subject to the requirements of the Woodland Sign Code. 
F.  Multiple Building Commercial and Business Complexes. Multiple building business parks that share a common parking lot shall follow the numbering system described in subsection B of this section, but shall accommodate future expansion as described in subsection E of this section. 
(Ord. No. 1307, § 1, 10-6-2014) 
12.30.030 - Assignment of addresses. 
    All houses, residences and places of business within the city shall be numbered in accordance with WMC 12.30.010.

The applicable federal regulations for this section are 40 CFR part 403 and the state regulations are in WAC 173-216. 
B.  Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the WWTP the following pollutants in any form (solid, liquid, or gaseous): 
1.  Any pollutant which either alone or by interaction may create a fire or explosive hazard in the WWTP, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (sixty degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21 or are capable of creating a public nuisance. This includes waste streams sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair. At no time shall a waste stream cause two successive readings on an explosion meter to be more than five percent nor any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter at any point in the collection system or treatment works; 
2.  Any pollutant which will cause corrosive structural damage to the WWTP, but in no case discharges with a pH less than 5.5 or more than 9.0, or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, or personnel of the WWTP, unless the system is specifically designed to accommodate such discharge and the discharge is authorized by an applicable wastewater discharge permit; 
3.  Any solid or viscous substances including fats, oils, and greases in amounts which may cause obstruction to the flow in a WWTP or other interference with the operation of the WWTP; 
4.  Any discharge of pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, sufficient to cause interference with the WWTP; 
5.  Any waste stream having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, or cause worker health or safety problems in the collection system. In no case shall wastewater be discharged at a temperature which causes the temperature of the influent to the treatment plant to exceed one hundred four degrees Fahrenheit (forty degrees Celsius) unless the system is specifically designed to accommodate such a discharge, and the discharge is authorized by an applicable wastewater discharge permit; 
6.  Any petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; 
7.  Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within any portion of the WWTP in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems; 
8.  Any trucked or hauled wastes, except at discharge points designated by the city and in compliance with all applicable city requirements and during specified hours; 
9.  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair; 
10.  Any of the following discharges unless approved by the administrative authority under extraordinary circumstances such as the lack of direct discharge alternatives due to combined sewer service or need to augment sewage flows due to septic conditions: 
a.  Noncontact cooling water in significant volumes; 
b.  Stormwater, and other direct inflow sources; or 
c.  Wastewaters significantly affecting system hydraulic loading, which do not require treatment or would not be afforded a significant degree of treatment by the WWTP; 
11.  Any dangerous or hazardous wastes as defined in WAC 173-303, as amended, except as allowed in compliance with that regulation; 
12.  Any substance which will cause the WWTP to violate its NPDES, state waste discharge or other disposal system permits or causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test; 
13.  Any substance which may cause the WWTP's effluent or treatment residues, sludges, or scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or would interfere with the reclamation process or cause the WWTP to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed pursuant to the federal, state, or local statutes or regulations applicable to the sludge management method being used; 
14.  Any discharge which imparts color which cannot be removed by the WWTP's treatment process such as dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently impart color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the city's NPDES permit. Color (in combination with turbidity) shall not cause the treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of the compensation point for photosynthesis activity in the receiving waters by more than ten percent from the seasonably established norm for aquatic life; 
15.  Any discharge containing radioactive wastes or isotopes except as specifically approved by the administrative authority in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations including WAC 246-221-190, disposal by release into sanitary sewerage systems; and meeting the concentration limits of WAC 246-221-290, Appendix A, Table I, Column 2; and WAC 246-221-300, Appendix B; 
16.  Any sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes or from industrial processes; 
17.  Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the administrative authority; 
18.  Any detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances in amounts which may cause excessive foaming in the WWTP; 
19.  Any incompatible substance such as: grease, animal guts or tissues, paunch contents, manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dusts, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, gas, tar asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes, or any other organic or inorganic matter greater than one-half inch in any dimension; 
20.  Persistent pesticides and/or pesticides regulated by the Federal Insecticide Fungicide Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); 
21.  Any wastewater, which in the opinion of the administrative authority can cause harm either to the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance, unless allowed under a legal and binding agreement by the administrative authority (except that no waiver may be given to any categorical pretreatment standard); 
22.  The pollutant limits in this section are established to protect against pass through and interference and reflect the application of reasonable treatment technology. No person discharging more than eight hundred gallons per day shall discharge wastewater in excess of the following daily maximum concentration limits unless authorized by a permit issued by the department of ecology and the City of Woodland. The pollutant limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the WWTP. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The public works director may impose mass loading limits in addition to concentration-based limits.

Detailed plans showing proposed pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before construction of the facility. All pretreatment facilities shall be located in an accessible location for the ease of inspection and maintenance. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying pretreatment facilities as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge under the provisions of this chapter. The user shall obtain all necessary construction and operating permits from the city. 
B.  Standard of Pretreatment. Users shall provide all known, available and reasonable methods of treatment, prevention and control, including best management practices, as required to comply with this chapter and state and federal regulations. 
C.  Requirement for Proper Operation. Prior to operation of the pretreatment facility, the user shall submit a copy of the proposed operations and maintenance procedures to the city for review and approval. Such pretreatment facilities shall be at all times under the control and direction of a person qualified to operate such facilities. The use of hot water, enzymes, bacteria, chemicals or other agents or devices for the purpose of causing the contents of a pretreatment device to be discharged into the sanitary sewer system is prohibited. 
D.  New Construction. Any subsequent proposal for significant changes in the user's operation or maintenance of existing pretreatment facilities shall be submitted to the city for review and approval prior to the user's initiation of such changes. Prior to any new construction or other modification of existing pretreatment facilities, the user shall submit detailed plans showing such proposed new construction or modifications. The user shall obtain any necessary construction permits before new construction or modification of an existing facility. If applicable, the user shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit or other control document. The review of such plans by the city shall not relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying its facility as necessary to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
E.  Submission of Plans and Reports. Engineering reports for pretreatment facilities shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 173-240 and Section 173-216-050(3) of the WAC, RCW 90.48.010 as amended, and shall be submitted in accordance with the director's pretreatment program procedures. 
F.  Grease and Oil Separators. 
1.  Food Service Users. Users, who operate restaurants, cafes, lunch counters, cafeterias, bars or clubs, or hotel, hospital, sanitariums, factory or school kitchens, butcher shops, or other establishments where food (polar) grease may be introduced to the sewer system, shall have pretreatment facilities to prevent the discharge of fat waste, oil and grease. Such pretreatment facilities shall be either a grease interceptor or grease trap as determined by the jurisdiction located outside the building, and installed in the wastewater line leading from sinks, drains or other fixtures where grease may be discharged. Grease interceptors shall be required on all new construction projects that have a Type 1 hood exhaust system. New grease interceptors or grease traps shall be in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code, and any other requirements by the city as set forth herein. Grease interceptors that include dishwasher effluent shall be sized to allow sufficient detention time to allow for cooling of the effluent. No more than four fixtures shall connect to an individual grease interceptor, and no sanitary facilities will be allowed to connect upstream of any grease interceptor. Subject to the director's approval, dishwater effluent may be excluded from pretreatment. Grease traps inside the kitchen area will only be allowed under special circumstances and shall only be approved by the director on a case-by-case basis. 
2.  Industrial/Commercial User. Users who operate automobile or truck repair facilities, car washes, steam cleaning facilities for motorized equipment, air compressor(s), automatic or coin-operated laundries, or any other establishments or equipment where petroleum based (non-polar) grease and oil, grit, or sand may be introduced to the sewer system, shall have pretreatment facilities to prevent the discharge of oil and grease. These pretreatment facilities shall be oil/water separators or interceptors located to collect such mixture of grease, oil, grit, sand, and water. Such facilities shall be in accordance with city and state standards. All new car washes shall be closed loop, no discharge systems. Proof of required operation and maintenance records must be made available for city inspectors. 
3.  Retrofit of User Facilities. Users may be required to retrofit facilities which were constructed prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. The requirement to retrofit shall be on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the director for compliance with city, state and federal regulations. The director may require installation of grease interceptors, grease traps or other pretreatment facilities for those facilities that violate discharge prohibitions and supplemental limitations as set forth in this chapter. In all cases, existing food service users that have a Type 1 hood exhaust system shall be required to retrofit with an approved grease trap or interceptor that is sized in accordance with the current Uniform Plumbing Code and its appendices. In deciding whether to require a user to retrofit their facilities, the director shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the extent of potential harm caused by the discharge, the magnitude and duration of the discharge, economic detriment to the user, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other relevant factors. Grease interceptor or grease trap size shall be determined in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code and any other requirements by the city as set forth herein at the time the user is notified that facility modifications are required. Sizing of grease traps or interceptors will be reviewed and may be modified at the request of the local sewer jurisdiction. All costs incurred in retrofitting a user's facility shall be the sole responsibility of the user. 
4.  Construction of Grease Traps and/or Grease Interceptors. Traps/interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable covers which when bolted in place shall be gastight, and vented. 
5.  Maintenance of Grease Traps and/or Grease Interceptors. Users shall maintain, at their sole expense, grease interceptors and/or grease traps and/or other pretreatment equipment in a manner that shall prevent fat waste, oil or grease from being carried into the sewer system at all times. Authorized city employees shall be allowed access to grease traps and interceptors for the purpose of inspection and/or to verify compliance with this chapter. Fat waste, oil or grease removed from such a facility shall not be disposed of in the sanitary or storm sewer. A record of disposal shall be maintained for review by the Southwest Washington Health District and the local sewer jurisdiction. 
G.  Provisions for the Implementation of Pretreatment Facilities. 
1.  If upon inspection the pretreatment facility in place is deemed inadequate by the public works director or if no pretreatment facility is in place and is deemed necessary by the public works director, a new pretreatment facility complying with the terms of the current plumbing code is required and shall be installed within thirty days of notice by the city of such deficiency. Failure to comply with these provisions shall result in the discontinuance of sewer service to the premises by the city shutting off the city water service. 
2.  Owners/users of such trap/interceptors shall perform regular maintenance upon such interceptors with such frequency as to insure their continued proper working condition. The owner is required to keep on-site at a minimum the last three years of all records of maintenance and pumping of facilities and provide such records to the city if requested. If upon inspection, the city determines that the ongoing maintenance by the owner/user is inadequate to insure proper operation of the interceptor, an order shall be issued declaring such deficiency and providing the owner/user fourteen calendar days to properly service the interceptor. If upon further inspection such maintenance has not been performed, a surcharge of one hundred dollars per day shall be imposed and added to the premises' sewer bill until such maintenance shall have been performed. Such surcharge shall continue until the owner/user calls for an inspection to determine compliance and compliance has been certified and an inspection fee of one hundred dollars shall also be assessed. 
3.  Any owner/user whose interceptor is declared to be improperly maintained a second time within twenty-four months of a prior determination shall be assessed the sewer surcharge of one hundred dollars per day from the date of the inspection.

A.  Definition. For the purposes of enforcement, the provisions of the rules establishing what constitutes a violation for general dischargers are set forth in this title. Those dischargers subject to national pretreatment standards will be subject to enforcement action in accordance with this title for any violations of the criteria and limitations specified in the categorical standard or the general pretreatment standards set forth in 40 CFR 403, same being incorporated herein by this reference. 
B.  Maximum Daily Concentration Allowed. The maximum daily allowable concentrations for dischargers not regulated under national pretreatment standards are violated under the following circumstances: 
1.  The arithmetic mean of concentrations for eight consecutive samples collected within a twenty-four-hour time period over intervals of fifteen minutes or greater is in excess of the limitation. 
2.  The concentration value obtained from composite sample that is representative of the twenty-four-hour discharge is in excess of the limitation. 
3.  The concentration of any single sample (whether as single grab sample or a sample within a series) exclusive of any fats, oils, and grease exceeds the limitation by a factor of two and one-half times. 
4.  The arithmetic means of the concentration of fats, oils, or greases for three grab samples, taken no more frequently than at five-minute intervals exceeds the limitation. 
C.  pH Sample. The pH of any given sample is less than pH 5.5 or greater than pH 9.0. 
D.  Temperature Limitation. The temperature limitation is exceeded for any single sample. 
E.  Maximum Allowable Poundage Limitations. A violation shall occur if the maximum allowable effluent poundage limitation as established in the private wastewater discharge permit is exceeded. The daily poundage discharged shall be calculated using the volume of effluent discharged that day times the concentration for that day either reported by the discharger or obtained through sampling by the city. The poundage shall be determined utilizing the formula: 
Lbs/day = conc. in mg/l x gal/day disch. × 8.34/1,000,000 
F.  Reporting Requirements. A violation shall occur if any reporting requirements established by permit, accidental discharges, upset conditions, written request of the administrative authority, or as specified by general pretreatment standards (40 CFR 403.12) are not complied with. A violation shall occur when any person knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other documents filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this title, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this title. 
G.  FOG Pretreatment Facility-Maintenance. A violation shall occur if there is any failure to maintain grease or grit interceptors or oil/water separators which causes maintenance on any sewer line to be greater than once every two years caused by excessive oil, grease, or fat buildup in the sewer lines; or excess buildup of sand, gravel or other materials clogging the sewer lines. The lack of any device to prevent discharge of grease, oil, fats, sand, gravel or any other materials which will cause excessive maintenance of the sewer lines shall not relieve the discharger of the responsibility of liability for any costs to the city for excessive maintenance and/or other costs, including overhead incurred by the city. 
H.  Discharge of Dangerous Waste. A violation shall occur if any material listed on the discharge chemical products list of the State of Washington (WAC 173-303-9903) is discharged into any public sewer or building sewer tributary thereto. 
I.  Explosion Meter Readings. A violation shall occur if the readings on an explosion meter at any point in the collection system or wastewater treatment plant is greater than ten percent for a single reading or greater than five percent for two successive readings. 
J.  Pass Through or Interference. Any discharge which causes pass through or interference with the wastewater treatment plant is a violation. 
K.  Emergency Suspension of Service and Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit or Limited Permit. 
1.  The city may, without advance notice, order the suspension of all or some portion of the wastewater treatment service and any applicable industrial wastewater discharge permit or limited permit to a discharger when it appears to the city that an actual or potential discharge: 
a.  Presents or threatens a substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment; 
b.  Threatens to or interferes with the operation of the wastewater treatment plant or collection system; or 
c.  Causes pass through to the environment or treatment process upset. 
2.  Any discharger notified of the city's suspension order shall cease immediately all discharges. In the event of failure of the discharger to comply with the suspension order, the city may commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's specific compliance with such order and/or to recover civil penalties. The city shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon proof by the discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or of the conditions creating the threat as set forth in this section and payment of all penalties and fees. 
3.  In addition to all other rights and remedies, the city shall have the authority to immediately discontinue water service to a discharger if the city determines that such action is reasonably necessary to suspend service as authorized by subsection (L)(1) of this section. The city shall have the right of access onto the discharger's private property to accomplish such termination of the water service. 
L.  Termination of Treatment Services-Permit Revocation. Dischargers holding NPDES or state discharge permits will be referred to DOE for violations and enforcement/revocation of their permit. The city shall have the authority to terminate wastewater treatment services and to revoke any locally issued industrial wastewater discharge permit or limited permit of the discharger if it determines that the discharger has: 
1.  Failed to accurately report wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
2.  Failed to report significant changes in wastewater constituents, characteristics, flow volumes or types of discharge to the wastewater treatment plant; 
3.  Refused reasonable access to the discharger's premises for purposes of inspection or monitoring; 
4.  Violated conditions of the wastewater discharge permit; 
5.  Violated any of the provisions of this title or regulations promulgated hereunder; 
6.  Violated any lawful order of the city issued with respect to the discharger's permit or this title; or 
7.  Tampers with, disrupts, damages or renders inaccurate any wastewater monitoring device required by this title. 
M.  Other Violations. 
1.  If reports required by permit, this title or state or federal pretreatment regulations are submitted later than thirty days after they are due, the discharger shall be subject to civil penalties of five hundred dollars per day for a maximum of twenty working days. The penalty shall then be increased to one thousand dollars per day with a maximum fine of twenty thousand dollars. In the event the reports have not been submitted at the time the maximum penalty is imposed, the city shall seek remedies under WMC 13.12.350. 
2.  If any of the actions prescribed in any compliance schedule established by permit or by order of the administrative authority are not complete within thirty days of the time they are required to be complete, the discharger shall be subject to civil penalties of five hundred dollars per day for a maximum of sixty days for each day the action(s) have not been completed. In the event the actions have not been completed ninety days after the date scheduled in the permit or order the city shall seek remedies under WMC 13.12.350. 
3.  If a discharger fails to maintain grease, oil and/or sediment removal systems which result in excessive maintenance by the city of the collection system or treatment plant, the discharger shall be subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars which shall be added to the costs incurred by the city to perform the maintenance. If excessive maintenance is required a second time within a two-year period, the penalty shall be one thousand dollars which shall be added to the costs of maintenance by the city. In the event excessive maintenance continues the city shall seek remedies under WMC 13.12.350. 
4.  Failure to provide accurate or complete information on any wastewater discharge reports or the requirements of a discharge permit shall result in a civil penalty of one hundred dollars for the first offense. Thereafter the discharger shall be subject to remedies under subsection (M)(1) of this section. 
5.  All commercial and industrial users are required to complete the annual user survey and submit the completed form to the utilities department within forty-five days of receipt.

Chapter 13.16 - UTILITY SERVICE OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS 
Sections: 

13.16.010 - Utility service application- Covenant. 
    As is detailed in this chapter, any applicant for new utility service to any property outside the city limits, or for an expanded level of utility service to such property, if it requires a sanitary sewer plan application or water meter service order, and who is not exempted under Section 13.16.070, shall be required at time of such application, or of application for approval of construction plan, as a prerequisite to being furnished such new or expanded service, to sign a statement to be furnished him or her by the city and designated a covenant, substantially in the form as set out following this chapter. Such covenant shall contain a legal description of the property proposed to be served and a statement that the signatures on the covenant shall be taken as signatures to a petition to annex said property to the city, that the signer will in fact sign a formal petition to annex upon request by the city, and that he understands such annexation is intended to occur when the property and other properties in any designated area constitute an area which is contiguous to the city. Such covenant shall be filed with the city clerk and be filed by the city with the county auditor and shall be a covenant running with the land therein described and be binding upon the signer and his or her successors and/or assigns. Such covenant shall be signed by all parties having any right, title and interest in the property, and shall provide that the city may enforce it by an action for specific performance and/or withdrawal and termination of all city's utility services after thirty days' written notice and an opportunity to be heard. Further, said service shall not be made available to the applicant until after the covenant has been filed for record and a subsequent title examination report, prepared at the expense of the applicant, has been furnished to the city clerk, showing that all parties in interest (other than holders of easements or similar such nonpossessory interests) have signed the covenants. 
(Ord. 514 § 1, 1981) 
13.16.020 - Proposed LIDs-Covenant. 
    In the case of proposed LIDs, the petition for water or sewer construction, when filed with the city clerk, shall be accompanied by annexation covenants signed by signers of the petition requesting formation of the LID. If council decides in any case to proceed with an LID for which some property owners have not petitioned or have not signed the covenant, then the ordinance creating the district shall provide that such owners shall not be permitted to connect to the facility constructed until they have signed and filed such a covenant; provided, city council may make exceptions to such requirement based upon a showing of hardship or upon any declaration of health hazard by the health department that service is necessary for public health reasons. Ordinarily, council will not approve any LID unless property owners representing seventy-five percent of the assessed value of the area proposed for the LID have signed such a covenant. 
(Ord. 514 § 2, 1981) 
13.16.030 - Proposed reimbursement contracts-Covenant. 
    In the case of proposed reimbursement contracts, the proposed contract between the city and developer shall be accompanied by a covenant to annex the developer's property, which covenant shall meet all requirements of Section 13.16.010, and shall be filed with the county auditor and shall run with the land. In addition, it will be the developer's responsibility to secure signed covenants to annex from owners of property which the city supervisor of public works finds will need to or probably want to connect to the facility constructed or proposed to be constructed under such agreement. 
    If council approves any such contract without all potential users of the facility having signed an annexation covenant, then persons who have not so covenanted shall not be permitted to connect and the latecomer agreement shall so provide; provided, city council may make exceptions to such requirements based upon a showing of hardship or upon any recommendation of the health department that service is necessary for public health reasons. 
(Ord. 514 § 3, 1981) 
13.16.040 - Subdivisions-Covenant. 
    In the case of any new subdivisions, the preliminary plat of which has not been preliminarily approved, the person or persons owning the property to be subdivided shall file such a covenant with the city clerk at the time he or they file the plat with county authorities and such covenant shall be consistent with Section 13.16.010, and shall run with the land. Service shall not be given to new subdivisions where the developer has not so covenanted. 
(Ord. 514 § 4, 1981) 
13.16.050 - Expanded services defined. 
    As used in this chapter, "expanded services" means and includes the following: 
Classification Condition Change Single-family lot Additional sewer lateral or additional water meter Multifamily Any additional units Commercial or industrial Larger of additional water meter, or additional or larger sewer lateral, or any sewage flow increase which requires a Department of Ecology permit.  
(Ord. 514 § 5, 1981) 
13.16.060 - Proposed annexation-Council approval. 
    Each proposed annexation will require council approval under RCW 35.13.125 and boundary review board approval under RCW Chapter 36.93. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as committing the city to providing extraterritorial water or sewer service, the intent of this chapter merely being to state the terms and conditions under which such service would be provided if and when a decision is made to provide such service. 
(Ord. 514 § 6, 1981) 
13.16.070 - Continuance of current service. 
    All out-of-city properties connected to city water or sewer utility service as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter will continue to be provided such utility service at existing service levels without reference to this chapter. Likewise, properties located in previously approved local improvement districts outside the city (those in which a resolution or intention had been approved by council prior to October 20, 1980) who have not yet connected thereto, but who have been assessed for such facilities and are paying a sewer charge, will be allowed to connect without a commitment to annexation, although each such applicant for service will be requested to commit to annexation. In addition, the city will conform to latecomer agreements it has previously entered into and will allow service connection to facilities constructed under such agreements without commitments to annexation, although each such applicant for such service will be asked to commit to annexation. 
(Ord. 514 § 7, 1981) 
13.16.080 - Denial of service. 
    The city, in its discretion, may choose not to allow either sewer or water service unless the applicant first annexes to the city. 
(Ord. 514 § 8, 1981)

Chapter 14.40 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
Sections: 

14.40.010 - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose, and objectives. 
A.  Statutory Authorization. The legislature of the state of Washington has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city adopts the following provisions as the city's flood prevention regulations. 
B.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of Woodland are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
C.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
1.  To protect human life and health; 
2.  To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects; 
3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
6.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
7.  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
8.  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
D.  Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, the ordinance codified in this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
1.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
4.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
5.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally aboveground. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either: 
1.  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
2.  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
    The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

(Ord. No. 1338, § 1, 11-16-2015) 
14.40.030 - General provisions. 
A.  Lands to Which this Chapter Applies. These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the corporate limits of the city. 
B.  Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for Cowlitz County and Incorporated Areas" dated December 16, 2015, and any revisions thereto, with accompanying flood insurance maps is adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study is on file at the office of the city building and planning department. In the event there is a conflict between the flood insurance maps adopted herein and the Flood Insurance Study for Cowlitz County and Incorporated Areas, both dated December 16, 2015, then the study shall control the identification and the location of special flood hazard areas. 
C.  Penalties for Noncompliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions), shall constitute a civil infraction as set forth in Chapter 14.50. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
D.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
E.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit or repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
F.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city and any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. 813 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 1996) 
(Ord. No. 1338, § 2, 11-16-2015) 
14.40.040 - Administration. 
A.  Establishment of Development Permit. 
1.  Development Permit Required. A development permit shall be obtained from the city's building official before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 14.40.030(B). The permit shall be for all structures including manufactured homes, as defined in Section 14.40.020, and for all development including fill and other activities, also as defined in Section 14.40.020. 
2.  Application for Development Permit. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the city's building official and may include but not be limited to plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question: existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
a.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; 
b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed; 
c.  Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in Section 14.40.050(B)(2); and 
d.  Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
B.  Designation of the Building Official. The city's building official is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. 
C.  Duties and Responsibilities of the Building Official. Duties of the building official shall include, but not be limited to: 
1.  Permit Review. 
a.  Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied. 
b.  Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required. 
c.  Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of Section 14.40.050(C)(1) are met. 
2.  Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 14.40.030(B), the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer Sections 14.40.050(B) and 14.40.050(C). 
3.  Information to be Obtained and Maintained. 
a.  Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood insurance study or required as in Section 14.40.040(C)(2), obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement. 
b.  For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures: 
i.  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean seal level), and 
ii.  Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section 14.40.040(A)(2)(c) 
c.  Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this ordinance. 
4.  Alteration of Watercourses. 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration. 
b.  Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. 
5.  Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 14.40.040(D) 
D.  Variance Procedure. 
1.  Appeal Board. 
a.  The ad hoc appeals board (hereinafter "board") as established in Chapter 14.48 hereof shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
b.  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the city's building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
c.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the city's building official, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the board, as provided by the procedural rules for appeal. 
d.  In passing upon such applications, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and 
i.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
ii.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
iii.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
iv.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
v.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
vi.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
vii.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
viii.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for that area; 
ix.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
x.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
xi.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
e.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 14.40.040(1)(d) and the purposes of this chapter, the board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
f.  The board shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
2.  Conditions for Variances. 
a.  Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (i-xi) in Section 14.40.040(D) (1)(d) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
b.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section. 
c.  Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
d.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
e.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
i.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
ii.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
iii.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
f.  Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece or property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare. 
g.  Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except Section 14.40.040(D) (2)(a), and otherwise complies with Sections 14.40.050(A)(1) and 14.40.050(A)(1)(b) of the general standards. 
h.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(Ord. 813 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 1996) 
14.40.050 - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
A.  General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required: 
1.  Anchoring. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
b.  All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (Reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas" guidebook for additional techniques). 
2.  Construction Materials and Methods. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
c.  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
3.  Utilities. 
a.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
b.  Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway; 
c.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and 
d.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
4.  Subdivision Proposals. 
a.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
b.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
c.  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and 
d.  Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least fifty lots or five acres (whichever is less). 
5.  Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source (Section 14.40.040(C)(2)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. 
B.  Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 14.40.030(B) or Section 14.40.040(C)(2), the following provisions are required: 
1.  Residential Construction. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must be either certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
i.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; 
ii.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
iii.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
c.  Additional requirements for below-grade crawlspaces: 
i.  The interior grade of a crawlspace below the base flood elevation (BFE) must not be more than two-feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as D in Figure 3; 
ii.  The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must not exceed four-feet (shown as L in Figure 3) at any point. The height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas. This limitation will also prevent these crawlspaces from being converted into habitable spaces; 
iii.  There must be adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural drainage through porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes, drainage tiles, or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means; 
iv.  The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five-feet per second for any crawlspace. For velocities in excess of five-feet per second, other foundations should be used; 
v.  Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. Ductwork, in particular, must either be place above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters; 
vi.  Below grade crawlspace construction in accordance with the requirements listed above will not be considered basements. 

Figure 3 Requirements regarding below-grade crawlspace construction. 
2.  Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
a.  Be floodproofed so that below one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; 
c.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 14.40.030(C)(3)(b); 
d.  Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in Section 14.40.050(B)(1)(b); 
e.  Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below). 
3.  Manufactured Homes. 
a.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-A30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 
i.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
ii.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
iii.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
iv.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement. 
b.  Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the above manufactured home provisions be elevated so that either: 
i.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
ii.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. At a minimum a "reinforced pier" would have a footing adequate to support the weight of the manufactured home under saturated soil conditions such as occur during a flood. In addition, if stacked concrete blocks are used, vertical steel reinforcing rods shall be placed in the hollows of the blocks and those hollows filled with concrete or high strength mortar. In areas subject to high velocity floodwaters and debris impact, cast-in-lace reinforced concrete piers may be appropriate. 
4.  Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
c.  Meet the requirements of Section 14.40.050(B)(3) above and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. 
C.  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 14.40.030(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
1.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for: (a) repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and (b) repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure either, (i) before the repair, or reconstruction is started, or (ii) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety codes or to structures identified as historic places shall not be included in the fifty percent. 
3.  If Section 14.40.050(C)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 14.40.050. 
D.  Encroachments. The cumulative effect of any proposed development, where combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point where a regulatory floodway has not been designated. 
E.  Standards for Shallow Flooding Areas (AO Zones). Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet above ground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply: 
1.  New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured homes within AO Zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest grade adjacent to the building, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
2.  New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO Zones shall either: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as in Section 14.40.050(B)(2)(c). 
3.  Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
4.  Recreational vehicles placed on sites within AO Zones on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
c.  Meet the requirements of Section 14.40.050(E) above and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. 
F.  Critical Facility. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area ("SFHA") (one hundred-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet or more above the level of the base flood elevation (one hundred-year) at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into flood waters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

D.  As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures. 
E.  When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within fifteen calendar days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal: 
1.  If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a determination of nonsignificance under WAC 197-11-340(2). 
2.  If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate. 
3.  The applicant's proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to "control noise" or "prevent stormwater runoff" are inadequate, whereas proposals to "muffle machinery to X decibel" or "construct two hundred foot stormwater retention pond at Y location" are adequate. 
4.  Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents. 
F.  A mitigated DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a fifteen calendar-day comment period and public notice. 
G.  Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city. 
H.  If the city's tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS). 
I.  The city's written response under subsection (B) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination.

2.  Maps depicting critical areas, soil types and other appropriate features; 
3.  Information and scientific opinions from appropriate agencies; 
4.  Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Priority Habitats and Species (PHS) and Salmonscape maps; 
5.  Documentation from other scientific sources; 
6.  Findings by qualified professionals or a reasonable belief by the director that a critical area may exist on or adjacent to the proposed activity. 
E.  Determination If Critical Area Report Is Needed. 
1.  No Critical Areas Present. If the director determines the proposed project is not within or adjacent to a critical area or buffer or that the project is not likely to degrade the functions or values of a critical area, then the director shall rule that no further critical area review is required. The director shall consult with resource agencies or individuals with special expertise, as necessary, to assist in the determination of critical areas and potential impacts associated with project proposals. A summary of the director's decision and review shall be included in the file and/or staff report. 
2.  Critical Area Present But No Impact. If the director determines there are critical areas within the proposed project but that the project is not likely to degrade the functions or values of a critical area, then the director may waive the requirements of a critical area report. The director shall consult with resource agencies or individuals with special expertise, as necessary, to assist in the determination of critical areas and potential impacts associated with project proposals. A waiver may be granted if all of the following are met: 
a.  No alteration of the critical area or buffer will occur;

E.  Increased Wetland Buffer Widths. The director shall require increased buffer widths when recommendations by a qualified professional biologist and the best available sciences deem increased buffer widths necessary. The determination shall be based on the following: 
1.  An increased buffer area is necessary to protect other critical areas within the same project area; 
2.  The buffer area or adjacent uplands have a slope greater than fifteen percent or the buffer is susceptible to erosion where standard erosion controls will not prevent adverse impacts to the wetland; 
3.  Where an increased buffer is recommended due to minimal vegetation cover, a vegetation planting plan may be implemented as a substitute to the increased buffer width. A vegetation planting plan shall not result in a decrease in the buffer area. The vegetation planting plan shall include measures to monitoring and maintenance of the vegetated area. 
F.  Special Conditions for a Possible Reduction in Buffer Widths. Distinct from the provisions of Section 15.08.100(D) of this chapter, the buffer widths recommended for proposed land uses with high-intensity impacts to wetlands can be reduced to those recommended for moderate-intensity impacts under the following conditions, and only after submittal of a critical areas report prepared by a qualified professional that provides clear justification for the reduced buffer: 
1.  For wetlands that score moderate or high for habitat, the width of the buffer can be reduced if both of the following criteria are met: 
a.  A relatively undisturbed, vegetated corridor at least one hundred feet wide is protected between the wetland and any other priority habitats as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife ("relatively undisturbed" and "vegetated corridor" are defined in questions H 2.1 and H 2.2.1 of the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington-Revised). The corridor must be protected for the entire distance between the wetland and the priority habitat by some type of legal protection such as a conservation easement. 
b.  All applicable measures to minimize the impacts of different land uses on wetlands, such as the examples summarized in Table 15.08.400-2, are applied. 
Table 15.08.400-2 
Examples of Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands from Proposed Change in Land Use That Have High Impacts 
(This is not a complete list of measures.) 
Examples of Disturbance Activities and Uses that Cause Disturbances Examples of Measures to Minimize Impacts Lights Parking lots Direct lights away from wetland Warehouses Manufacturing Residential Noise Manufacturing Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland Residential Toxic runoff* Parking lots Route all new, untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered Roads Manufacturing Residential areas Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides within 150 feet of wetland Application of agricultural pesticides Apply integrated pest management Landscaping Stormwater runoff Parking lots Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development Roads Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enters the buffer Manufacturing Residential areas Commercial Landscaping Change in water regime Impermeable surfaces Infiltrate or treat, detain, and disperse into buffer new runoff from impervious surfaces and new lawns Lawns Tilling Pets and human disturbance Residential areas Use privacy fencing; plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion; place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract Dust Tilled fields Use best management practices to control dust  
    *These examples are not necessarily adequate for minimizing toxic runoff if threatened or endangered species are present at the site. 
2.  For wetlands that score fewer than five points for habitat, the buffer width can be reduced to that required for moderate land-use impacts by applying measures to minimize the impacts of the proposed land uses (see examples in Table 15.08.400-2). 
G.  Averaging of Buffer Widths. The director may allow for the standard buffer width to be averaged in accordance with an approved critical area report on a case-by-case basis. Averaging of buffer widths shall be allowed only when a qualified wetlands professional demonstrates that: 
1.  Averaging will not reduce wetland functions or values; 
2.  The wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places due to varying wetland quality; 
3.  The total area of the averaged buffer is not less than would be contained if there were no buffer averaging; and 
4.  The buffer width is not reduced to less than twenty-five percent of the standard buffer width or fifty feet, whichever is greater in any one location. 
H.  Buffer Conditions Shall Be Maintained. Wetland buffers in their natural state shall not be altered and shall be maintained in an undisturbed condition except as allowed in this chapter. 
I.  Mitigation Buffers. Any wetland that is created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved regulated wetland alterations shall have the standard buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland. 
J.  Altered Wetland and/or Buffer Areas. Applicants are encouraged to restore wetlands or buffer areas that exist in a degraded state adjacent to a project not impacting the buffer in order to replace lost or diminished ecological functions and values. Applicants are required to restore a wetland or buffer that was impacted by their project. Prior to the issuance of a permit for development that is proposed adjacent to degraded wetlands or buffers, the property owner shall agree to undertake restoration activities or authorize such activities to occur, through an approved legal device such as a conservation program or restoration effort, or by legal agreement with restoration agencies or groups. Access shall be granted by the property owner for such restoration activities. 
K.  Functionally Isolated Buffer Areas. Areas which are functionally separated from a wetland and do not protect the wetland from adverse impacts due to preexisting roads, structures, or vertical separation shall be excluded from buffers otherwise required by this chapter on a case-by-case basis subject to a critical area report and review as determined by the director. 
L.  Exempted Wetlands. 
1.  All isolated Category IV wetlands less than four thousand square feet that: 
a.  Are not associated with riparian areas or their buffers. 
b.  Are not associated with shorelines of the state or their associated buffers. 
c.  Are not part of a wetland mosaic. 
d.  Do not score five or more points for habitat functions based on the 2014 update to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (ecology Publication #14-06-029, or has revised and approved by ecology). 
e.  Do not contain a priority habitat or a priority area for a priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat. 
2.  Wetlands less than one thousand square feet that meet the above criteria and do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat are exempt from the buffer provisions contained in this chapter. 
M.  Use of Buffer Areas. The following uses may be permitted within a required wetland buffer unless otherwise prohibited: 
1.  Conservation and Restoration Activities. Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife. 
2.  Passive Recreation. Passive recreation in accordance with an approved critical area report. Such activities include but are not limited to: 
a.  Walking paths or trails (no motorized use) located in the outer twenty-five percent of the buffer area. Trails shall, to the extent feasible, be placed on existing road grades, utility corridors, or any other previously disturbed area and may need to be enhanced with screening. Trails or paths within a wetland or buffer area shall be planned to minimize removal of vegetation (trees, shrubs, etc.) and important wildlife habitat. Trail widths shall not be wider than three feet for private trail and ten feet for public use or publicly owned trails. Trail surfaces shall be made or constructed of pervious surfaces (natural materials like wood chips) and permanent surfacing materials (asphalt or concrete) shall require a variance. No construction or surfacing materials shall significantly alter the existing drainage or negatively affect the wetland or buffer area; 
b.  Wildlife viewing structures, platforms, interpretive areas, picnic areas, benches and associated activities shall be designed and located to minimize disturbance to wildlife habitat and/or critical wetland and/or buffer values or functions; 
c.  Access to fishing areas via walking paths or trails. 
3.  Hazard Tree Removal. When a threat to human life or property is determined, the director may allow the falling of a danger or hazard tree subject to the following criteria: 
a.  The applicant shall submit a report from a certified arborist, registered landscape architect, or professional forester that documents the hazard and provides a replanting schedule for the replacement trees. 
b.  Tree cutting shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary to abate the hazard. 
c.  All non-noxious weed vegetation and cut wood (tree stems, branches, etc.) shall be left within the critical area or buffer unless removal is warranted due to the potential for disease or pest transmittal to other healthy vegetation; 
d.  The landowner shall replace any trees that are removed with new trees at a ratio of two replacement trees for each tree removed (2:1) within one year. Replacement trees may be planted at a different, nearby location if it can be determined that planting in the same location would create a new hazard or potentially damage the critical area. Replacement trees shall be of a native species, appropriate to the surrounding habitat type, and of a minimum 15-gallon pot size or equivalent balled or burlapped stock and 4 feet in height. 
e.  If a tree to be removed provides critical habitat, such as an eagle perch, a qualified wildlife biologist shall be consulted to determine timing and methods of removal that will minimize impacts. 
4.  Stormwater Management Facilities. A wetland or its buffer can be physically or hydrologically altered to meet the requirements of an LID, Runoff Treatment or Flow Control BMP if ALL of the following criteria are met: 
a.  The wetland is classified as a Category IV or a Category III wetland with a habitat score of 3-4 points, and 
b.  There will be "no net loss" of functions and values of the wetland, and 
c.  The wetland does not contain a breeding population of any native amphibian species, and 
d.  The hydrologic functions of the wetland can be improved as outlined in questions 3, 4, 5 of Chart 4 and questions 2, 3, 4 of Chart 5 in the "Guide for Selecting Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach." (available here: http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/0906032.html); or the wetland is part of a priority restoration plan that achieves restoration goals identified in a Shoreline Master Program or other local or regional watershed plan, and 
e.  The wetland lies in the natural routing of the runoff, and the discharge follows the natural routing, and 
f.  All regulations regarding stormwater and wetland management are followed, including but not limited to local and state wetland and stormwater codes, manuals, and permits, and 
g.  Modifications that alter the structure of a wetland or its soils will require permits. Existing functions and values that are lost would have to be compensated/replaced. 
h.  Stormwater LID BMPs required as part of new and redevelopment projects can be considered within wetlands and their buffers. However, these areas many contain features that render LID BMPs infeasible. A site-specific characterization is required to determine if an LID BMP is feasible at the project site.

(Ord. No. 1384, § 17, 2-21-2017) 
15.08.410 - Signing and fencing wetlands. 
A.  Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of a wetland or buffer area and the limit of the wetland or buffer area to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit, shall be marked in the field in such a way as to prevent unauthorized disturbance of the wetland or buffer area. Temporary marking shall be maintained throughout the permitted activity and shall not be removed until final inspections are completed and approved permanent signs, if required, are in place. The location of temporary markers shall be shown on all site plans and final plats associated with the proposal. Temporary markers shall be composed of one-half inch galvanized pipe or equivalent monument, at least eighteen inches long, and shall show above the surface at least two inches. Temporary markers shall be spaced no more than fifty feet apart or as determined by the director. 
B.  Permanent Signs. The director may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of the wetland buffer as a condition of any permit. Permanent signs shall be made of an enamel-coated metal face and attached to a metal post or another non-treated material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one every fifty feet, or one per lot if the lot is less than fifty feet wide, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The signs shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the director: 
Protected Wetland Area 
Do Not Disturb 
Contact the City of Woodland 
Regarding Uses, Restrictions, and 
Opportunities for Stewardship 
C.  Temporary Fencing. All wetlands shall be temporarily fenced between the permitted activity and the buffer with a highly visible and durable protective barrier during the proposed activity to prevent access and to protect the critical area and buffer. The director may waive this requirement if an alternative to fencing which achieves the same objective is proposed and approved. 
D.  Permanent Fencing. The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on site. Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this Subsection shall be designed so as not to interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat. 
(Ord. 1069 § 1 (part), 2006) 
(Ord. No. 1384, § 18, 2-21-2017) 
15.08.420 - Stormwater management. 
    The following stormwater management standards are required as they apply to each activity: 
A.  New developments shall utilize best management practices to minimize stormwater quantity and quality impacts to wetlands, both during and following construction. 
B.  Stormwater runoff from new development shall not significantly change the rate of flow, hydroperiod which is the seasonal period and duration of water saturation or inundation, nor decrease the water quality of wetlands. 
C.  Authorized modifications of wetlands or buffer areas for construction of discharge from drainage facilities shall protect wetland hydrologic functions classified pursuant to this section. 
D.  Stormwater runoff shall not be diverted from the watershed of wetlands. 
E.  Developments which handle, store, dispose, or transport or generate hazardous substances/wastes defined as "dangerous" or "extremely dangerous" wastes under WAC 173-303 (regardless of quantity) shall not allow direct precipitation or stormwater runoff to contact such substances where stored on-site. 
F.  The Washington State Department of Ecology's Stormwater Manual shall be the standard reference when implementing a stormwater management plan unless the director authorizes an alternative approach. 
(Ord. 1069 § 1 (part), 2006) 
15.08.430 - Wetland mitigation. 
A.  Mitigation Sequencing. Before impacting any wetland or its buffer, an applicant shall demonstrate that the following actions have been taken. Actions are listed in order of preference. A lower-preference form of mitigation shall be used only if the applicant's qualified wetland professional demonstrates to the city's satisfaction that all higher-ranked types of mitigation are not viable: 
1.  Avoid the impact completely by not taking certain action or parts of the action; 
2.  Minimize impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts; 
3.  Resolve the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment; 
4.  Reduce or eliminate the impact over time by preservation, restoration and maintenance; 
5.  Compensate for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; 
6.  Monitoring the required compensation and taking remedial or corrective measures when necessary. 
B.  Requirements for Wetland Mitigation. 
1.  Mitigation for alterations of wetlands shall be used only for impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized and shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Mitigation plans shall be consistent with Wetland Mitigation in Washington State - Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans - Version 1. (Ecology Publication #06-06-011b), Olympia, WA, March 2006, or as revised), and Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Publication #09-06-32, Olympia, WA, December 2009). 
2.  Mitigation ratios shall be consistent with subsection (G) of this section. 
3.  Mitigation requirements may also be determined using the credit/debit tool described in Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Final Report (Ecology Publication #10-06-011, Olympia, WA, March 2012, or as revised) consistent with subsection (H) of this section. 
C.  Compensating for Lost or Affected Functions. Mitigation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project, with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement functions. The goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost, except when either: 
1.  The lost wetland provides minimal functions, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington state watershed assessment plan or protocol; or 
2.  Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types. 
D.  Approaches to Mitigation. Mitigation for lost or diminished wetland and buffer functions shall rely on the approaches listed below. 
1.  Wetland Mitigation Banks. Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the mitigation bank instrument. Use of credits from a wetland mitigation bank certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC is allowed if: 
a.  The approval authority determines that it would provide appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts. 
b.  The impact site is located in the service area of the bank. 
c.  The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the certified mitigation bank instrument. 
d.  Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits is consistent with replacement ratios specified in the certified mitigation bank instrument. 
2.  In-Lieu Fee Mitigation. Credits from an approved in-lieu fee program may be used when all of the following apply: 
a.  The approval authority determines that it would provide environmentally appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts. 
b.  The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the approved in-lieu-fee program instrument. 
c.  Projects using in-lieu-fee credits shall have debits associated with the proposed impacts calculated by the applicant's qualified wetland professional using the credit assessment method specified in the approved instrument for the in-lieu-fee program. 
d.  The impacts are located within the service area specified in the approved in-lieu-fee instrument. 
3.  Permittee-Responsible Mitigation. In this situation, the permittee performs the mitigation after the permit is issued and is ultimately responsible for implementation and success of the mitigation. Permittee-responsible mitigation may occur at the site of the permitted impacts or at an off-site location within the same watershed. Permittee-responsible mitigation shall be used only if the applicant's qualified wetland professional demonstrates to the approval authority's satisfaction that the proposed approach is ecologically preferable to use of a bank or in-lieu fee program, consistent with the criteria in this section. 
E.  Location of Mitigation. Mitigation actions shall generally be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when the applicant can demonstrate that off-site mitigation is ecologically preferable. The following criteria will be evaluated when determining whether the proposal is ecologically preferable. When considering off-site mitigation, preference should be given to using alternative mitigation, such as a mitigation bank, an in-lieu-fee program, or advance mitigation. 
1.  There are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin (e.g. on-site options would require elimination of high-functioning upland habitat), or opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts. Consideration should include: anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation, buffer conditions and required widths, available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored, proposed flood storage capacity, and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity). 
2.  On-site mitigation would require elimination of high-quality upland habitat; 
3.  Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the altered wetland. 
4.  Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage basin unless: 
a.  Established watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or 
b.  Credits from a state-certified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation, and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the certified bank instrument; 
c.  Fees are paid to an approved in-lieu-fee program to compensate for the impacts. 
5.  The design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location (i.e., position in the landscape). Therefore, compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation, restoration, or enhancement of an atypical wetland. 
F.  Timing of Mitigation. It is preferred that mitigation projects be completed prior to activities that will impact wetlands. At the least, mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and flora. 
1.  The director may authorize a one-time temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay. An appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties (e.g. project delay lapses past a fisheries window, or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials). The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety, or general welfare of the public. The request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the mitigation plan. The justification must be verified and approved by the City. 
G.  Mitigation Ratios. Any wetland that is degraded as a result of a permitted or nonpermitted activity shall be restored, created or enhanced at an area equal to or greater than the wetland area that was altered in order to compensate for losses to wetland acreage or functions according to the following ratios: 
Category and Type of Wetland Creation or 
Re-establishment Rehabilitation Enhancement Category I: Bog, Natural Heritage Site Not considered possible Case by Case Case by Case Category I: Mature 
Forested 6:1 12:1 24:1 Category I: Based on functions 4:1 8:1 16:1 Category II 3:1 6:1 12:1 Category III 2:1 4:1 8:1 Category IV 1.5:1 3:1 6:1  
H.  Credit/Debit Method. To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios found in the joint guidance Wetland Mitigation in Washington State Parts I and II (Ecology Publication #06-06-011 a-b, Olympia, WA, March 2006), the director may allow mitigation based on the "credit/debit" method developed by the Department of Ecology in Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Final Report, (Ecology Publication #10-06-011, Olympia, WA, March 2012, or as revised). 
I.  Mitigation Plan. When a project involves wetland and/or buffer impacts, a compensatory mitigation plan prepared by a qualified professional shall be required, meeting the following minimum standards: 
1.  Wetland Critical Area Report. A critical area report for wetlands must accompany or be included in the compensatory mitigation plan and include the minimum parameters described in minimum standards for wetland reports of this chapter. 
2.  Compensatory Mitigation Report. The report must include a written report and plan sheets that contain, at a minimum, the following elements. Full guidance can be found in Wetland Mitigation in Washington State - Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans (Version 1) (Ecology Publication #06-06-011b, Olympia, WA, March 2006 or as revised). 
a.  The written report must contain, at a minimum: 
i.  The name and contact information of the applicant, the name, qualifications, and contact information for the primary author(s) of the mitigation report; a description of the proposal; a summary of the impacts and proposed compensation concept; identification of all the local, state, and/or federal wetland-related permit(s) required for the project; and a vicinity for the project. 
ii.  Description of how the project design has been modified to avoid, minimize, or reduce adverse impacts to wetlands. 
iii.  Description of the existing wetland and buffer areas proposed to be altered. Include acreage (or square footage), water regime, vegetation, soils, landscape position, surrounding land uses, and functions. Also describe impacts in terms of acreage by Coward in classification, hydrogeomorphic classification, and wetland rating, based on wetland ratings of this chapter. 
iv.  Description of the mitigation site, including location and rationale for selection, Include an assessment of existing conditions: Acreage (or square footage) of wetlands and uplands, water regime, sources of water, vegetation, soils, landscape position, surrounding land uses, and functions. Estimate future conditions in this location if the compensation actions are NOT undertaken (i.e. how would this site progress through natural succession). 
v.  Surface and subsurface hydrologic conditions, including an analysis of existing and proposed hydrologic regimes for enhanced, created, or restored mitigation areas. Include illustrations of how data for existing hydrologic conditions were used to determine the estimates of future hydrologic conditions. 
vi.  A description of the proposed actions for compensation of wetland and upland areas affected by the project. Include overall goals of the proposed mitigation, including a description of the targeted functions, hydrogeomorphic classification, and categories of wetlands. 
vii.  A description of the proposed mitigation construction activities and timing of activities. 
viii.  Performance standards (measurable standards for years post-installation) for upland and wetland communities, a monitoring schedule and actions proposed by year. 
ix.  A discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect wetlands after the development project has been implemented, including proposed monitoring and maintenance programs (for remaining wetlands and compensatory mitigation wetlands). 
x.  A bond estimate for the entire mitigation project, including the following elements: Site preparation, plant materials, construction materials, installation oversight, maintenance twice per year for up to five years, annual monitoring field work and reporting, and contingency actions for a maximum of the total required number of years for monitoring. 
xi.  Proof of establishment of notice on title for the wetlands and buffers on the project site, including the mitigation areas. 
b.  The scaled plan sheets for the mitigation must contain, at a minimum: 
i.  Surveyed edges of the existing wetland and buffers, proposed areas of wetland and/or buffer impacts, location of proposed wetland and/or buffer compensation actions. 
ii.  Existing topography, ground-proofed, at two-foot contour intervals in the zone of the proposed compensation actions if any grading activity is proposed in the compensation area(s). Also include existing cross-sections (estimated one-foot intervals) of wetland areas on the development site that are proposed to be altered and for the proposed areas of wetland or buffer compensation. 
iii.  Conditions expected from the proposed actions on site, including future hydrogeomorphic types, vegetation community types by dominant species (wetland and upland), and future water regimes. 
iv.  Required wetland buffers for existing wetlands and proposed compensation areas. Also identify any zones where buffers are proposed to be reduced or enlarged of the standards identified in this chapter. 
v.  A planting plan for the compensation area, including all species by proposed community type and water regime, size and type of plant material to be installed, spacing of plants, typical clustering patterns, total number of each species by community type, and timing of installation. 
J.  Buffer Mitigation Ratios. Impacts to buffers shall be mitigated at a minimum 1:1 ratio. Compensatory buffer mitigation shall replace those buffer functions lost from development. 
K.  Protection of the Mitigation Site. The mitigation area and any associated buffer shall be located in a critical areas tract or a conservation easement consistent with this chapter. 
L.  Monitoring. Mitigation monitoring shall be required for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but not for a period less than five years. If a scrub-shrub or forested vegetation community is proposed, monitoring may be required for ten years or more. The project mitigation plan shall include monitoring elements that ensure certainty of success for the project's natural resource values and functions. If the mitigation goals are not obtained within the initial five-year period, the applicant remains responsible for restoration of the natural resource values and functions until the mitigation goals agreed to in the mitigation plans are achieved. 
M.  Advance Mitigation. Mitigation for projects with pre-identified impacts to wetlands may be constructed in advance of the impacts if the mitigation is implemented according to federal rules, state policy on advance mitigation, and state water quality regulations consistent with Interagency Regulatory Guide: Advance Permittee-Responsible Mitigation (Ecology Publication #12-06-015, Olympia, WA, December 2012). 
N.  Alternative Mitigation Plans. The director may approve alternative wetland mitigation plans that are based on best available science, such as priority restoration plans that achieve restoration goals identified in the SMP. Alternative mitigation proposals must provide an equivalent or better level of protection of wetland functions and values than would be provided by the strict application of this chapter. 
    The director shall consider the following for approval of an alternative mitigation proposal: 
1.  The proposal uses a watershed approach consistent with Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Ecology Publication #09-06-32, Olympia, WA, December 2009). 
2.  Creation or enhancement of a larger system of natural areas and open space is preferable to the preservation of many individual habitat areas. 
3.  Mitigation according to subsection (E) is not feasible due to site constraints such as parcel size, stream type, wetland category, or geologic hazards. 
4.  There is clear potential for success of the proposed mitigation at the proposed mitigation site. 
5.  The plan shall contain clear and measurable standards for achieving compliance with the specific provisions of the plan. A monitoring plan shall, at a minimum, meet the provisions in subsection (I). 
6.  The plan shall be reviewed and approved as part of overall approval of the proposed use. 
7.  A wetland of a different type may be justified based on regional needs or functions and values; the replacement ratios may not be reduced or eliminated unless the reduction results in a preferred environmental alternative. 
8.  Mitigation guarantees shall meet the minimum requirements as outlined in subsection (I). 
9.  Qualified professionals in each of the critical areas addressed shall prepare the plan. 
10.  The city may consult with agencies with expertise and jurisdiction over the critical areas during the review to assist with analysis and identification of appropriate performance measures that adequately safeguard critical areas.

15.08.440 - Aquifer recharge areas. 
    Aquifer recharge areas are those areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water as defined by WAC 365-190-030(2). Aquifer recharge areas have geologic conditions associated with infiltration rates that create a high potential for contamination of groundwater resources or contribute significantly to the replenishment of groundwater. 
    This section establishes areas determined to be critical in maintaining both groundwater quantity and quality. The purpose of this chapter is to protect aquifer recharge areas from degradation or depletion resulting from new land use activities.

Chapter 15.12 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
Article I. - Introduction 

15.12.010 - Findings. 
    The council finds that: 
A.  Inadequately controlled stormwater runoff results in increased stormwater runoff volumes, peak flow rates and duration of peak flows in the city's streams, thereby causing flooding and safety hazards, and erosion, scouring, and deposition of sediment; 
B.  Untreated stormwater runoff discharges nutrients, metals, oil and grease, toxic materials, and other forms of pollution to the city's surface and ground water resources, thereby endangering their use for recreation, drinking water, and fisheries; 
C.  Stormwater problems from new development should be prevented and corrected at the time that such development occurs and that the governmental approval to proceed with new development should be so conditioned; 
D.  The most financially sound and most equitable method for financing the improvements necessary to correct existing problems from stormwater runoff and to provide and maintain surface and ground water quantity and quality within drainage basins is for the owners and occupiers of existing properties and future developments within such basins to share the financial burden for such facilities and corrections with other funding sources when available; and 
E.  The most technically and financially efficient method of addressing problems caused by stormwater runoff is through basin plans.

Chapter 16.06 - PREAPPLICATION CONFERENCE 
Sections: 

16.06.010 - Purpose. 
    The preapplication conference is an informal forum at which the tentative concepts and design of a prospective subdivision are discussed. The conference is intended to be a means of screening subdivision proposals in their earliest stages of design, taking place before proponents are committed to a particular design and before they have drawn a preliminary plat. It is also a means for staff and other public officials to convey information needed by the prospective subdivider, to make suggestions, to identify problems and information needs, to determine a proposal's feasibility, to acquaint the prospective applicant with the procedural steps for plat reviews, and to initiate the process for compliance with the State Environmental Policy Act. By providing for such a conference, the city intends to improve the quality of information presented in the subdivision review process; to minimize unproductive debate at public hearings; to discourage premature, unsafe or inadequately prepared proposals; and to add certainty to and expedite the subdivision review process. 
(Ord. 509 Art. III § 1.1, 1980) 
16.06.020 - Applicability. 
    The preapplication conference is optional but strongly encouraged. Prospective subdividers who do not arrange for a conference are likely to encounter delay or denial. If the proponent of a prospective subdivision does not participate in a preapplication conference, and if at a public hearing on a preliminary plat the planning commission finds that necessary information is lacking or that the plat raises significant problems or questions, the commission shall have authority to close the hearing immediately and forward a recommendation for disapproval with findings to the city council. If the plat is denied under the circumstances set out in this section, and the prospective sub-divider desires to have the plat considered again, he shall reapply to the city and pay new application fees. 
(Ord. 509 Art. III § 1.2, 1980) 
16.06.030 - Participants-No notice or fee. 
    The preapplication conference is intended to be an informal meeting between the prospective subdivider or his agents, city staff, planning staff, and representatives of other public agencies and utilities at their option. Therefore, no public notice of the conference shall be given or fee charged. The service need not include field inspections or extensive correspondence, and the conference may be repeated as necessary. Responsibilities of participants shall be as set out in Sections 16.06.040 through 16.06.120.

C.  Requirements for geologic reports under Sections 16.14.110 through 16.14.160 of this ordinance and requirements of the commission for special studies under Section 16.08.080 shall be independent of any requirement for an EIS. However, if an EIS has been required, geologic reports and special studies shall be prepared and reviewed concurrently with the EIS and their results included in the EIS. 
D.  If the city's responsible official for SEPA has determined that an environmental impact statement is required, the commission may develop and forward to the official a list of research subjects that the commission recommends be emphasized in the preparation of the EIS. Research subjects recommended for special emphasis in the EIS may include: 
1.  Any of the elements of the physical and human environments listed in WAC 197-10-444 (see Appendix "A" attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and on file in the office of the city clerk); 
2.  Any of the additional elements listed in Section 10 of Woodland Environmental Policy Ordinance 428 (see Section 15.04.100 of this code), which include economy, cultural factors, and sociological factors; 
3.  Any of the elements required by WAC 197-10-440 as contents of the EIS (see Appendix "B" attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and on file in the office of the city clerk), including but not limited to timing of construction phases; alternatives to the proposal; direct, indirect, cumulative and growth-inducing impacts of the proposal; and measures to mitigate impacts. 
E.  If the responsible official for SEPA has determined that an EIS is not required or has not yet made a determination and the planning commission determines that an EIS would aid in its deliberations on the proposal, the commission may recommend to the official that he withdraw the negative threshold determination issued pursuant to WAC 197-10, that he make a positive threshold determination, or that he request such additional information from the applicant as the commission may identify as needed. Any such recommendation shall be advisory. 
F.  Applications for preliminary plat approval shall be held in abeyance until completion of the draft EIS when the responsible official has required an EIS, and, at the discretion of the planning commission, applications may, but normally shall, be held in abeyance until the final EIS is available. No preliminary plat for which an EIS has been required shall be approved or disapproved by the city council until the final EIS has been completed. 
G.  The commission or council may utilize the findings of any EIS in taking action to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove a plat.

    No building permit shall be issued prior to final plat approval. No occupancy permit shall be issued prior to satisfactory completion of improvements. No person other than the subdivider or owner may be issued a building permit prior to completion of improvements. 
(Ord. 509 Art. IV § 5, 1980) 
16.12.190 - "As-built" plans. 
    After completion of all required improvements, but prior to acceptance of completed work by the public works director, the subdivider shall furnish the public works director with an acceptable set of reproducible plans indicating the "as-built" condition of the work. Such plans shall show all changes, additions and deletions in alignments, grades, and other engineering detail from the original detailed construction plans, all of which shall be certified by an engineer registered in the State of Washington responsible for the work.

Chapter 16.14 - DESIGN STANDARDS 
Sections: 

16.14.010 - Applicability. 
    The requirements of this chapter shall be followed in the development of all subdivisions, except as indicated in Chapter 16.22, and shall be considered minimum standards. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.1, 1980) 
16.14.020 - Conformance to applicable plans, laws, ordinances and regulations. 
    In addition to standards contained in this chapter, all subdivision plats shall comply with the following: 
A.  The plans, programs and ordinances listed in Section 16.08.160; 
B.  APWA Specifications; 
C.  The current edition of the Uniform Fire Code, as may be amended by the city; 
D.  Policies for place names of the Cowlitz County communication center; 
E.  Applicable state laws and regulations. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.2, 1980) 
16.14.030 - Master plan-Preparation. 
A.  Phasing from Inception. If a subdivision development is to be carried out in successive phases, a master plan shall be prepared by the subdivision applicant and submitted with the application. The master plan shall be prepared on a separate sheet from the proposed., preliminary plat and shall satisfy specifications for master plans set forth in Section 16.18.030. 
B.  Modifying an Existing Subdivision Plan/Plat to Allow Phasing. If either a master plan or application for a subdivision has been submitted and received preliminary plat approval, the developer may submit an application to amend the master plan for the purpose of completing the subdivision in phases, provided: 
1.  The phasing plan includes all land identified in the legal notice for the public healing in which the initial preliminary approval was granted, including any land areas where off-site improvements are constructed; 
2.  The map attached to the proposed phasing plan includes a specific time schedule showing the sequence of build-out of the phased development; 
3.  The master plan satisfies the specifications for master plans set forth in Section 16.18.030. 
C.  Review of an Application to Amend a Master Plan to Allow Phasing. The development review committee shall review the application for a phasing plan if the committee finds the following conditions have been met and expresses its authority as described herein: 
1.  The application submitted meets the requirements of WMC 16.14.030(2); 
2.  The amendment permits construction in phases, but the amendment does not alter any other conditions of the preliminary approval, including the five-year term of the original approval; 
3.  The amendment treats each phase as an independent project and each phase, therefore, must independently satisfy all requirements set forth in the preliminary plat approval, and any applicable development standards in WMC, including but not limited to density, open space, public and private infrastructure, landscaping, pedestrian and vehicle circulation, and stormwater detention. For purposes of this section, a "phase" includes a contiguous group of lots that satisfy all applicable development standards without reference to a different contiguous group of lots. An applicant cannot rely on improvements anticipated to be constructed in future phases to satisfy requirements for a preceding phase; 
4.  The director of public works has made a determination that the applicant has provided satisfactory assurance, including any required documents from the applicant and any financial assurances, that for each phase all essential streets, roads, sanitary sewer, storm sewers, stormwater utilities, water and other public improvements, including but not limited to drainage improvements and erosion control will be completed consistent with the original approved preliminary plat; 
5.  The committee has the authority to determine the scope, size and sequence of each phase and to require the applicant to complete essential features of the subdivision which serve all phases of the subdivision. The committee may require specific improvements necessary for any part of the development to be completed as part of the first phase, regardless of phasing design or the completion schedule of future phases. By way of example, construction of a stormwater detention pond needed for the first phase must be completed even if the location of the pond is on land to be developed in a later phase or the capacity of a detention pond for the first phase is less than the capacity needed to serve the entire subdivision; 
6.  The security for completion of any improvements meets the requirements of WMC 16.12. 
D.  Extensions. A developer can request an extension to apply for the final plat for the entire subdivision. A request for an extension may be submitted at the same time an application to allow phasing is submitted. The purpose of permitting concurrent applications is to allow the development review committee to review the extension request at the same time it reviews the phasing application. 
1.  Eighteen-Month Extension. Provided the request has been filed with the city more than thirty days prior to the expiration of the original five-year period and the applicant makes a factual showing of good faith attempts (i) to comply with material conditions of the preliminary plat approval and (ii) to meet the conditions for the final plat within the five-year period, the development review committee may grant an eighteen-month extension; 
2.  Additional Extensions. Provided the request has been filed with the city no more than sixty days but no less than thirty days prior to the expiration of the eighteen-month extension, the Development review committee shall review an application for an additional two-year extension. The committee may grant such extension if: 
a.  The applicant provides evidence of good faith attempts to comply with all material conditions of preliminary plat approval, from the time the first extension was granted through the time of application for the subsequent extension. A "good faith" effort includes but is not limited to the submittal of engineering plans or survey calculations or similar filings necessary for the final document approval; 
b.  At the time of the request for extension, the approved preliminary plat is not inconsistent with either the Woodland comprehensive plan, Woodland zoning and other development ordinance or development standards or any other applicable code, state law, regulation or executive order or federal law, regulations or executive order, without regard to whether the substantive requirements of those acts have been changed, modified, amended or superseded by subsequent action; 
c.  One phase of the development has been completed and final plat approval obtained for that phase or thirty percent of the public infrastructure for the entire subdivision has been completed; and 
d.  At the time of the request, levels of service for public infrastructure/utilities, including but not limited to transportation, water, sewer, are lower than the minimum standards. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.3(1), 1980) 
(Ord. No. 1172, § 1, 4-5-2010) 
16.14.040 - Master plan-Purpose. 
    The purpose of a master plan prepared for a preliminary subdivision plat with phasing in the original application or for a preliminary plat amendment with phasing applied for subsequent to the approval of the preliminary plat is to provide sufficient guidance to the DRC regarding the intended scope and sequence of the construction of the subdivision so that the DRC can adequately plan for developments on adjacent properties. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.3(2), 1980) 
(Ord. No. 1172, § 1, 4-5-2010) 
16.14.050 - Master plan-Phased developments. 
    The city may approve a phasing plan for a subdivision if the proposed phasing plan satisfies the requirements set forth in WMC 16.14.030. The applicant shall prepare as part of its application to use phasing in a development: a master plan, a preliminary plat of the first phase and a separate preliminary plat for each successive phase. 
A.  Convert to Phasing. The DRC shall take one of the following actions on an application to permit phasing for an approved preliminary plat: 
1.  Approve the phasing plan if (i) the plan does not alter conditions of the preliminary approval and (ii) no significant issues are presented; 
2.  Conditionally approve the phasing plan if any identified significant issues are substantially mitigated by minor revisions to the original approval; 
3.  Deny the phasing plan if either: (i) the plan will alter conditions of the preliminary approval; or (ii) the significant issues cannot be substantially mitigated by minor revisions. 
B.  Extensions. The DRC shall take one of the following actions upon receipt of a timely extension request: 
1.  Approve the extension request if no significant issues are presented as set forth in the Woodland Municipal Code; 
2.  Conditionally approve the application if any significant issues presented are substantially mitigated by minor revisions to the original approval; 
3.  Deny the extension request if any significant issues presented cannot be substantially mitigated by minor revisions to the approved plan. 
C.  No phasing or extension shall be approved for any land situated in a flood control zone as set forth in RCW 86.16 without the proper written approval of the State Department of Ecology. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.3(3), 1980) 
(Ord. No. 1172, § 1, 4-5-2010) 
16.14.060 - Subdivision names. 
    Subdivision names shall not duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically the name of any other subdivision within the Woodland urban area, except that in the case of successive subdivisions of a phased development, plats may be differentiated in name by sequential numbering or by direction (north, south, etc.). 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.4(1), 1980) 
16.14.070 - Street names. 
    Street names shall not duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically the name of any other street within the Woodland urban area, except in the case of new streets serving as a continuation of existing streets. Streets having the same name except for "Court," "Lane," or other suffix shall be deemed duplicative and not permitted. Names of new streets running on a line with an existing street but separated by a park or barrier may duplicate the name of the existing street, provided that a prefix indicating direction from the park or barrier is attached to the new street's name. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.4(2), 1980) 
16.14.080 - Council authority to select names. 
    The city council shall have the right to name subdivisions and streets. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.4(3), 1980) 
16.14.090 - Preservation of natural features. 
A.  Plats shall be designed to preserve and enhance natural features and resources, including natural contours, watercourses, marshes, scenic points, large trees, natural groves, rock formations and sensitive areas; to be compatible with aesthetic values of the area; and to reflect natural limitations inherent in the property. 
B.  Plats shall be designed to preserve to the extent possible trees with trunk diameters of eight inches or greater measured four feet above ground level. 
C.  Relocation of natural watercourses such as drainage-ways, channels or streams shall be discouraged and piping or tunneling normally allowed only for channelization under streets. 
D.  The soil conservation service (Kelso office) should be consulted for measures to minimize soil erosion. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.5, 1980) 
16.14.100 - Impact on environs. 
    Plats shall be designed to minimize impacts on adjacent properties and on off-site or city-wide public facilities and services, such as streets, drainageways and storm sewers. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 1.6, 1980) 
16.14.110 - Soil, geologic and hazard considerations-Effect on plat design. 
A.  So that plat design reflects natural limitations and hazards inherent in the property, the following document shall be used in the design and review of plats for determining areas most appropriate for roads, building foundations, utilities and nondevelopment (open space): "Soil Survey for the Cowlitz Area, Washington" (Soil Conservation Service, 1974) and 1979 update. 
B.  Areas with slopes greater than eight percent shall be deemed sensitive to development and shall be given careful consideration in plat design. Areas with slopes greater than thirty percent generally shall be deemed unsuitable for development, and instead suitable for open space, including unimproved park land. 
C.  As slopes increase and as soils exhibit moderate to severe limitations for urban development, as documented by qualified geologists, soils scientists or engineers, the density of development should decrease. Thus plats should provide for larger lot sizes, fewer roads and clustering of development on more appropriate building areas. 
D.  Areas documented to be hazardous or probably hazardous for development in geologic feasibility reports prepared pursuant to Section 16.14.130 shall be designed as open space, including unimproved park land. 
E.  Areas that the city council, as recommended by the public works director and/or the community development director, determines to be unsuitable for development due to flood hazards, poor drainage, rock formations or other features likely to be harmful to the safety and welfare of future residents and adjacent landowners shall be designed as open space, unless protective improvements assuring maintenance of the public safety and welfare and acceptable to the public works director can be developed. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 2.1, 1980) 
(Ord. No. 1378, § 45, 11-21-2016) 
16.14.120 - Geologic report requirements. 
    The purpose of the requirements of Sections 16.14.110 through 16.14.160 is: 
A.  To protect the public health, safety and welfare in the development of hillside subdivisions; 
B.  To provide understanding of the degree of geologic hazard of hillside locations proposed for subdivision; 
C.  To assure that hillside subdivision design will reflect geologic conditions; 
D.  To implement the findings contained in the soil survey and the goals and policies of the Woodland comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 2.2, 1980) 
16.14.130 - When geologic reports required. 
    The soil survey and update referred to in Section 16.14.110 classify soils as having slight, moderate or severe limitations for development. A geologic feasibility report shall be required of the subdivider for every site having "moderate" or "severe" limitation in one or more of the following categories: 
A.  Natural hazard (soil slip potential); 
B.  Foundations for low buildings; 
C.  Secondary roads and trails. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 2.3, 1980) 
16.14.140 - Maps controlling. 
    Soil maps contained in the soil survey shall be controlling in determining limitations for development by location by soil type. Determinations of location by soil type shall be made by the community development director and shall be conclusive. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 2.4, 1980) 
(Ord. No. 1378, § 46, 11-21-2016)

    The community development director shall be responsible for evaluating submitted geologic reports for adequacy and conformance to Section 16.18.040. The community development director may consult with the soil conservation service, Washington Department of Natural Resources, or other qualified agencies or individuals with respect to the adequacy of the report. The community development director may require additional information to be submitted by the applicant. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 2.6, 1980) 
(Ord. No. 1378, § 47, 11-21-2016) 
16.14.170 - Lot design-Generally. 
A.  Except as provided in Section 16.14.180, all lots shall be of sufficient size to meet the minimum requirements of the zoning ordinance for the zone in which the property is located with respect to size, depth, width at street right-of-way, width at building line, yards, percentage of coverage and, if applicable, parking and loading. 
B.  All lots shall be provided direct access by means of minimum frontage on a public street right-of-way connecting to a developed public street. 
C.  Lots and streets shall be designed so that no residential property has direct driveway access to major arterials. Direct driveway access to minor arterials and collectors shall be minimized. 
D.  Where alleys are shown, the commission and council may limit lot depth to prevent future alley lots or buildings. 
E.  Where lots are more than double the minimum size required for the zone, the subdivider may be required to arrange lots so to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets to serve potential lots. 
F.  In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless variation from this rule will provide a better street or lot plan. 
G.  Lots shall be laid out so to provide drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed to avoid concentration of storm water from one lot to an adjacent lot. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 3.1, 1980) 
16.14.190 - Block design-All areas. 
    Intersecting streets shall be so laid out that blocks shall not be more than one thousand three hundred feet in length between street rights-of-way. In the case of blocks long or oddly shaped, and to facilitate pedestrian access to parks, playgrounds, open space or schools, the subdivider may be required to construct pedestrian crosswalks of not less than five feet in width on a dedicated right-of-way or perpetual unobstructed easement of not less than ten feet in width, to extend through the block(s) at location(s) deemed necessary. Widths of blocks shall be such as to allow two rows of lots, except that blocks along the perimeters of a plat may have one row of lots. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 3.3, 1980) 
16.14.200 - Lot and block design-Commercial and industrial uses. 
    Lots and blocks intended for commercial and industrial use shall be designed specifically for such purposes, with adequate space provided for off-street parking, loading and delivery. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 3.4, 1980) 
16.14.210 - Parks. 
    The city council may review the need for park development when reviewing preliminary subdivision plats and may require the developer to dedicate land for park development as a condition of approval. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 4, 1980) 
16.14.220 - Watercourse easement. 
    If a subdivision is transversed by a watercourse, such as a drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a perpetual stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the seasonal high water line of the watercourse and of such further width as will insure protection of water-carrying capacity and access to the watercourse for maintenance of capacity. Such recorded easement or right-of-way shall be measured from the centerline of the watercourse and shall give to the appropriate authority access for the purpose of maintenance of water-carrying capacity. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 5.1, 1980) 
16.14.230 - Utility easements. 
    Perpetual easements to utility providers for installation and maintenance of utilities shall be provided to serve each and every lot at locations deemed necessary by the utility providers. Such utilities may include sewer, water, gas, electric, telephone and television lines and cables. Utility easements shall be at least ten feet in width or five feet on each side of joint property lines. When the utility easements are needed at lot corners, the size of the easement shall be at least five feet by five feet. Additional easements for major distribution and transmission lines or unusual electric or communication facilities may be required. 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 5.2, 1980) 
16.14.240 - Street and right-of-way design-Generally. 
A.  Use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs and U-shaped streets shall be encouraged in residential subdivisions to avoid conformity of lot appearance and to discourage through traffic. 
B.  Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography and shall follow the more gradual natural contours of the land. 
C.  Streets shall be designed so as to provide for continuation of principal streets in adjoining subdivisions and, where appropriate, allow for future opening of streets to possible adjoining subdivisions. In no case shall proposed streets extend existing streets at less than the width of the existing street. 
D.  All streets shall be platted and constructed at the full width required in Section 16.14.250 and Table 1. 
E.  The number of intersections of local and collector streets with minor and major arterials shall be minimized. 
F.  In that direct driveway access to major arterials is prohibited and direct driveway access to minor arterials and collectors is to be minimized pursuant to subsection C of Section 16.14.170, the following design option shall be encouraged: 
1.  Provision of local streets parallel to arterials and collectors, with series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such parallel street and with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing on the arterial or collector; 
2.  Provision of marginal access or service roads separated from the arterial or collector by a buffer strip. 
G.  In all subdivisions bordering upon publicly owned or controlled bodies of water, there shall be provided one or more rights-of-way to the low water mark dedicated to the public, such rights-of-way having a minimum width of sixty feet and being capable of improvement for public access. 
H.  Where existing streets adjacent to or within a subdivision are of inadequate width or where the city's capital improvements plan or comprehensive plan indicates need for a new street or additional right-of-way or realignment for an existing street, the subdivider shall dedicate necessary right-of-way to the city in the filing of the final plat. 
I.  Where residential subdivisions abut a major arterial, the subdivider shall provide a buffer strip at least ten feet in width along the property line abutting the arterial. The buffer strip may or may not be dedicated and shall be improved in accordance with subsection B of Section 16.16.060. If not dedicated, the strip shall be designated on the plat as follows: "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of any structure hereon is prohibited." 
(Ord. 509 Art. V § 6.1, 1980) 
16.14.250 - Minimum widths. 
    Minimum standards for width (in feet) of street right-of-way, pavement (measured from curb face to curb face), utility/planting strips, and sidewalks shall be as specified in Chapter 12.10.

6.  Distance from center of permanent turning circle to residential subdivision boundary: one hundred fifty feet. 
B.  Where property adjacent to a subdivision is undeveloped and where the council determines it is desirable to allow for future continuation of a street into the adjacent property, the right-of-way shall extend to the subdivision boundary and an interim turning circle shall be provided. The radius of such turning circle shall conform to subsections (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section. The final plat shall contain a notation that land outside the normal street right-of-way within the turning circle shall revert to abutting property owners whenever the street is continued. 
(Ord. 854 § 6, 1997: Ord. 686 § 2, 1989: Ord. 509 Art. V § 6.3, 1980) 
16.14.270 - Grade of streets. 
    Street grades shall not exceed seven percent for arterials. Collector and local street grades should not exceed ten percent. Streets with grades between six percent and ten percent shall be constructed of six-inch portland cement six-sack mix. All streets shall have a grade of at least 0.20 percent at the gutter. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade whenever possible. In hilly areas, a leveling area of a distance acceptable to the public works director shall be provided at the approach to intersections.

Chapter 16.16 - IMPROVEMENTS-REQUIRED 
Sections: 

16.16.010 - Drainage system. 
A.  A drainage system satisfactory to the public works director shall be required in all subdivisions. Underground storm sewers or drainage-ways connecting or intended to connect in the future to storm sewers or drainageways outside the subdivision may be required by the public works director. 
B.  The drainage system shall be adequate to contain a twenty-five-year storm without ponding on private property except within drainage easements. In the calculation of system needs, a fully developed drainage basin upstream from the subdivision shall be assumed so that potential runoff of upstream areas can be accommodated. 
C.  The drainage system shall be installed in the street rights-of-way. Storm sewer location shall conform to the standard utility location plans (see Figures 4, 5 and 6, included in Chapter 16.16). Installation shall conform to requirements of the public works director and to the APWA specifications. 
D.  Ditches and pumps may be required in low-lying areas, water retention basins in uphill areas, and such additional devices necessary to contain the twenty-five-year storm. 
E.  The subdivider may be required to replace or make improvements to storm sewers and other drainage systems off the subdivision site. 
(Ord. 509 Art. VI § 1, 1980) 
(Ord. No. 1378, § 51, 11-21-2016) 
16.16.020 - Clearing, grubbing and grading. 
A.  Prior to initiation of construction in street or crosswalk rights-of-way, the entire right-of-way shall be cleared and grubbed in accordance with the APWA specifications. 
B.  Prior to the city's acceptance of improvements, all land to be developed in the subdivision shall be cleared and grubbed of downed trees, snags, brush, rocks, roots, rubbish and other debris, and holes created by grubbing suitably filled with other than the debris. 
C.  Prior to the city's acceptance of improvements, land to be developed shall be graded as necessary to effectuate the twenty-five-year storm drainage system. 
D.  All street rights-of-way shall be graded to their full width so that streets and sidewalks are constructed on the same plane. 
E.  Where a street intersection involves cut embankments or vegetation inside a lot corner that may create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the subdivider may be required to cut such ground or vegetation in connection with the grading of the right-of-way to provide an adequate sight distance. 
(Ord. 509 Art. VI § 2, 1980) 
16.16.030 - Cut and fill embankments. 
    Cut and fill embankments for streets shall be seeded to provide a soil-holding vegetative cover, or otherwise protected against erosion. The soil conservation service should be consulted on appropriate erosion control methods. 
(Ord. 509 Art. VI § 3.1, 1980) 
16.16.040 - Grass in utility/planting strip. 
    The subdivider shall be responsible for insuring that, prior to issuance of an occupancy permit for a lot, the utility/planting strip abutting the curb adjacent to the lot is seeded in grass or sodded. Seeding or sodding shall be conducted in accordance with the APWA specifications. The subdivider shall be liable to the city for incomplete grass seeding or sodding at the cost of sodding as estimated by the public works director. These provisions do not apply to utility strips located outside the sidewalk under the integral curb and sidewalk option for local streets serving single-family residential areas. 
(Ord. 509 Art. VI § 3.2, 1980) 
(Ord. No. 1378, § 52, 11-21-2016)

Chapter 16.22 - PLANNED UNIT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS[3] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1206, § 1, adopted February 22, 2011, amended Chapter 16.22 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Chapter 16.22, §§ 16.22.010-16.22.380, pertained to similar material, and derived from Ord. No. 509, 1980; Ord. No. 821, 1996 and Ord. No. 938, 2000. 

16.22.010 - Purpose and nature. 
    The intent of this chapter is to promote greater flexibility and, consequently, more imaginative design for the development of residential areas than generally is possible under conventional zoning and subdivision regulations. It is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of land while providing for a harmonious variety and grouping of housing types, a higher level of urban amenities, and preservation of open spaces and areas identified or believed to be hazardous for development. The planned unit residential development (PURD) option offers the subdivider increased density, lower costs, permissive variation in zoning and subdivision standards, and opportunities to carry out architectural themes, in return for which the city realizes higher quality living environments than normally obtained by traditional subdivision development. 
    To assist in the implementation of the city of Woodland's policy to reduce sprawl, provide affordable housing to all economic segments of the population, retain open space, enhance recreational opportunities, and protect the natural environment, the city of Woodland finds that employing a performance-based system that allots points for carrying out development-related goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan will foster opportunities for employing more imaginative design. This performance-based system assigns a point value for desired site design and development features. Certain minimum site design criteria need to be satisfied in order for a project to qualify for PURD consideration. More creative design will result in a greater accumulation of points, which then provides greater incentives, flexibility and permissive variation from zoning and subdivision standards. 
(Ord. No. 1206, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
16.22.020 - Applicability. 
    These regulations may be invoked at the option of the subdivider and with the approval of the city in the LDR, MDR and HDR districts provided that minimum qualifying criteria have been satisfied. In furtherance of the comprehensive plan, the city may require subdivisions in areas of geologic hazard or steep slope to comply with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1206, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
16.22.025 - PURD classifications, incentives and required qualifying criteria points.

d.  Increased density in the LDR from six dwelling units per acre (du/ac) to twelve du/ac. 
2.  To qualify for a basic PURD in the city of Woodland, a development must accumulate a minimum of thirty-nine points from the following development related categories: 
a.  Adhere to one of the affordable housing techniques-Minimum three points; 
b.  Provide open space & recreation (must include pedestrian connectivity)-Minimum twenty points; 
c.  Provide street connectivity-Minimum four points; 
d.  Provide acceptable structural characteristics-Minimum twelve points. 
B.  Advanced PURD 
1.  A project that provides advanced PURD features qualifies for the following development incentives: 
a.  No minimum lot size and building setback requirements; 
b.  Negotiate flexible street standards; 
c.  Critical areas density transfer in accordance with requirements of WMC 16.22.060.B; 
d.  Increased density in the LDR from six du/ac to twenty-five du/ac provided: 
i.  Multifamily development (more than fifty percent of the dwelling units) shall not be located adjacent or in close proximity (less than one-quarter mile) to another primarily multifamily development also in the LDR zoning district. 
ii.  Multifamily development shall include transitional techniques such as perimeter buffering, the stepping back of building heights or other methods of providing sufficient transition between single family and multifamily residential developments. 
iii.  The property shall front either an arterial or collector road or be within one-quarter mile of a commercial zoning district where pedestrian connectivity exists or is proposed as part of the PURD as an off-site improvement. 
2.  To qualify for an advanced PURD in the city of Woodland, a development must accumulate a minimum of sixty-nine points from the following development related categories: 
a.  Provide inclusionary housing as a means of adhering to the affordable housing technique requirement-Minimum eight points; 
b.  Provide open space and recreation (must include pedestrian connectivity) - minimum thirty points; 
c.  Provide street connectivity-Minimum four points; 
d.  Provide low impact development (LID) stormwater facilities-Minimum seven points;

(Ord. No. 1206, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
16.22.030 - Allowed uses. 
A.  Standard Uses. PURDs may include all of the uses which are allowed in the base zone by right, with limitations, or as a conditional use. 
B.  The combination of permitted and accessory uses listed in the zoning ordinance for the LDR, MDR, and HDR districts together and including condominiums, which shall also be subject to Chapter 16.20, provided that sufficient qualifying criteria have been satisfied. 
C.  Recreational facilities, including but not limited to tennis courts, swimming pools, playgrounds, golf courses, trails, and structures accessory to such facilities. 
D.  Community halls or social clubs, churches, schools and libraries. 
E.  Zero lot line development, as defined and restricted by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1206, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
16.22.040 - Base zone standards. 
    The development standards of the zoning district in which the type of residential development would normally be allowed applies unless they are superseded by the standards of this chapter. 
    A project that qualifies as an advanced PURD under WMC 16.22.025.B must meet the standards of the medium density multifamily residential, MDR district in order to develop multifamily residential buildings. Any request to deviate from the MDR standards as an incentive to develop, as provided by WMC 16.22.025.B.1.a, must be approved by the review body. 
(Ord. No. 1206, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
16.22.050 - Size limitation. 
    The minimum size for a PURD is two acres. There are no maximum size limitations for PURDs. 
(Ord. No. 1206, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
16.22.060 - Calculation of density. 
A.  The number of dwelling units allowed in PURDs is calculated in the following manner: 
The developable site area shall be the area exclusive of streets on the perimeter of and within the site, any right-of-way, land set aside for schools and religious institutions, critical areas defined in WMC 15.08.030, and any non-private easement(s) including, but not limited to, easements for gas pipe lines, water and sanitary sewer mains, stormwater systems, other utilities, or accesses. 
B.  Density may be increased in the LDR zoning district in accordance with WMC 16.22.025.A.1.d or WMC 16.22.025.B.1.d upon successful satisfaction of the PURD qualifying criteria. 
1.  Critical Areas Density Transfer. The city recognizes that some environmentally sensitive lands regulated by WMC Chapter 15.08, Critical Areas Regulations, have development potential if the project is properly designed. For instance, limited development activity may be permitted in an erosion and landslide area where the applicant demonstrates the ability of the site to accommodate development in accordance with performance standards detailed in an accepted geotechnical assessment or report. 
As an incentive to avoid or minimize the potential adverse effects of developing within environmentally sensitive areas, the city may allow density to be transferred from a constrained portion of a site that has demonstrated development potential to an unconstrained area on the same site when developing a PURD. Such density transfers achieve protection of critical areas while permitting the property owner to retain some or all development rights and potentially save great expense of mitigating for encroachments. 
The city shall allow transfer of density for residential uses from lands containing developable portions of critical areas, as defined by WMC Chapter 15.08, when satisfying all the following conditions: 
a.  The applicant shall submit all reports and follow determination and mitigation procedures required in WMC Chapter 15.08, Critical Areas Regulations. 
b.  In addition to the required information of a critical areas report detailed in WMC 15.08.160 and other sections of the chapter specific to the type of critical area(s), the report shall also specifically indicate and discuss the portion of the critical area(s) believed to be constrained, but that have development potential. 
c.  The report shall specifically indicate and discuss the unconstrained portion of the site proposed to accommodate the density transfer along with a recommendation from the professional preparing the report as to the ability of the unconstrained portion of the site to accommodate additional density. 
(Ord. No. 1206, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
16.22.070 - Lot sizes. 
    A basic PURD shall qualify for a reduction of up to fifty percent of the minimum lot size. There is no minimum lot size for an advanced PURD. Lot sizes shall be established as part of the preliminary plat process. 
(Ord. No. 1206, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
16.22.075 - Criteria necessary to qualify as a PURD. 
    This performance-based system assigns a point value for desired site design and development features that implement the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan and other plans adopted by the city, categorized as follows: 
Affordable housing techniques; 
Open space and recreational features; 
Infrastructure and public improvements; 
Structure characteristics. 
    The following points are assigned to desired design and development features and shall be used when determining if a project qualifies for a PURD as provided in WMC 16.22.025: 
A.  Affordable Housing Techniques. Housing types in zones which allow residential uses are not restricted. However, a variety of housing types and architectural styles allowing a range of prices and rents is encouraged. This variety includes, but is not limited to, multifamily, single family, duplex, and zero lot line developments. 
1.  Zero Lot Line Development-Three Points. Zero lot line development is one siting approach consistent with the intent of this chapter. For the purposes of this article, "zero lot line development" is the siting approach whereby a single-family detached dwelling is sited on one side lot line with no side yard provided, and the dwelling on the lot abutting the zero lot line is sited on this side lot line either adjacent to or farthest from the zero lot line. The approach is shown in Figure 9, following this chapter. The intent of this section is to provide for a housing design befitting small lots and higher density, to encourage increased usable yard on a lot, and to allow flexibility in housing development. (For Figure 9, see end of this chapter). 
a.  Zero Lot Line Development-Standards. To insure adequate light, air, privacy, and maintenance, zero lot line development shall be subject to the standards herein. For single-family dwellings to be located on a side lot line with no setback, the following conditions shall apply: 
i.  The lot adjacent to the zero setback side yard shall be under the same ownership at the time of initial construction. 
ii.  The side yard setback on the lot adjacent to the zero setback side yard shall be zero or at least ten feet. 
iii.  The side yard setback on the lot adjacent to the zero setback side yard shall be kept perpetually free of permanent obstructions such as a tool shed or a fence without a gate. 
iv.  An easement of five feet in width shall be provided on the adjacent lot for maintenance of the exterior portion of the zero lot line wall unless common wall construction. 
v.  A lot developed with a zero setback side yard may be as small as four thousand square feet in area and may be as little as forty feet in width at the building line. 
vi.  A lot developed with a zero setback side yard must have no less than one thousand seven hundred square feet of total yard area unobstructed by buildings. 
vii.  Each lot shall have one side yard a minimum of ten feet in width. 
2.  Traditional Neighborhood Design-Three Points. One-family and two-family homes on small lots, narrow front yards with front porches and gardens, detached garages in the backyard, utilizing standards of WMC 17.16.090, traditional neighborhood design optional development standards. 
3.  Cluster Subdivision-Four Points. This technique provides for the clustering of housing units within a residential development on lots smaller than those normally allowed under existing zoning, with the provision that the land that is saved be set aside permanently as open space. 
a.  Cluster Subdivision-Standards. 
i.  Unit size-Maximum: One thousand five hundred square feet excluding garage. Cottages may not exceed one thousand square feet on the main floor. Any additions or increases in unit sizes after initial construction shall be subject to compliance with all cottage housing development standards. 
ii.  Maximum density: Twelve units per acre. 
iii.  Minimum lot size-None. Lot sizes shall be determined through administrative design review process. 
iv.  Development size-Minimum: Six units. Maximum: Twenty-four units. Minimum cluster: Six units. Maximum cluster: Twelve units. Cottage clusters may be integrated into small lot developments where the combined number of cottage and small lot units may exceed twenty-four. Cluster size is intended to encourage a sense of community among residents. Homes within a cluster generally orient toward each other, community open space, or pathways and are not separated by roads or critical areas. A development site may contain more than one cluster provided there is a clear separation between clusters. Clusters shall be connected via pedestrian pathway(s). 
v.  Open Space. In accordance with "open space qualifying points" in section 16.22.075.B.5. 
vi.  Attached Covered Porches. Each unit must have a covered porch with a minimum area of sixty-four square feet and a minimum dimension of eight feet. 
vii.  Parking requirements-Units less than eight hundred square feet: One space per unit minimum. Units more than eight hundred square feet: One and one-half spaces per unit minimum. Must be provided on the subject property. Additional shared guest parking may not exceed one-half spaces per unit. 
viii.  Garage requirements-Private garages: Two hundred fifty square foot maximum floor area. Shared garages: One thousand two hundred square foot maximum floor area. Front loaded garages shall be recessed more than ten feet from the front facade of the cottage and their visual impact shall be minimized through the use of architectural design elements. 
ix.  Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). Not permitted as part of a cluster development. 
4.  Infill or Redeveloped Site-Four Points. Infill is the use of land within a built-up area for further construction, especially as part of a community redevelopment or growth management program. It focuses on the reuse and repositioning of obsolete or underutilized buildings and sites. Examples include attached townhomes or detached carriage houses. 
5.  Inclusionary Housing-Eight Points. The city of Woodland aspires to provide affordable housing to citizens within all income ranges. Projects that participate in Washington State Housing Finance Commission's Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, the Washington State Housing Trust Fund, or any other designated affordable housing program acceptable to the city will qualify as satisfying this criterion. 
B.  Open Space and Recreational Features. Open space and recreational features are an essential component of the PURD. Minimum open space requirements and recreational features are required to qualify as a PURD per WMC 16.22.025. For the purposes of this article, "open space" is categorized and defined as follows: 
1.  "Passive open space" is an improved or unimproved area that serves as a visual relief in the built environment and may be characterized by undisturbed natural vegetation or areas intended for people to enjoy being outdoors. Passive open space provides one or more of the following functions: 
a.  Physical separation or transition between structures or environmentally sensitive lands regulated by WMC Chapter 15.08, Critical Areas Regulations. Lands regulated by WMC Chapter 15.08 do not count as open space area except the outer fifty percent of a required buffer protecting land designated as a critical area may count as passive open space area if improved with pedestrian trails, benches, picnic tables, view platforms or other amenities that provide opportunities to enjoy the outdoors. 
b.  Providing aesthetically pleasing areas such as commonly owned undisturbed natural areas, landscaped areas, entry features, areas dedicated for public art and lawns. 
c.  Providing superior design in stormwater facilities by integrating a combination of low impact development (LID) techniques and passive recreational amenities provided the areas are not fenced or gated. The intent is to reward integrating design of required improvements and discourage simple fenced retention and/or detention ponds. Additionally, landscaped roof areas that are devoted to recreational or leisure-time activities, freely accessible to residents, structurally safe, and adequately surfaced shall be considered open space. 
2.  "Active open space" is an improved and maintained area under common ownership that provides opportunities for physical exercise including, but is not limited to, all purpose pedestrian trails, pools, child play areas, recreational or social buildings, play fields and sports courts. 
3.  Open space does not include street right-of-way, parking lots or yards in a platted lot, underground utility easements, storm water facilities (unless improved in accordance with WMC 16.22.075.C.3), and critical areas (unless improved in accordance with WMC 16.22.075.B.1.a). 
4.  Open Space Guidelines. 
a.  Most of the total area designed as open space should be contiguous rather than scattered around the development in small parcels and should be accessible to all residents. 
b.  The area of any parcel designed for active recreational use shall not be less than six thousand square feet nor less than thirty feet in width or length. 
c.  The amount, use and character of the open space shall be appropriate for the expected population and number and type of dwelling units. 
d.  If a PURD is to be developed in phases, the development schedule shall coordinate the provision and improvement of the open space with development of the area for residential buildings so that no phase shall be without significant amount of open space. At the time of preliminary plat approval, the review body may require a certain amount or certain sites of open space to be provided with any development phase. 
5.  Open Space Qualifying Points. 
a.  Undeveloped passive open space for low density residential development (up to six dwelling units per acre) shall provide a minimum one thousand five hundred square feet per lot or dwelling unit of undeveloped natural area-three points; 
b.  Developed passive open space for low density residential development (up to six dwelling units per acre) shall provide a minimum one thousand square feet per lot or dwelling unit, developed and maintained area-five points; 
c.  Undeveloped passive open space for medium density residential development (up to twenty-five dwelling units per acre) shall provide a minimum seven hundred fifty square feet per lot or dwelling unit of undeveloped natural area-three points; 
d.  Developed passive open space for medium density residential development (up to twenty-five dwelling units per acre) shall provide a minimum five hundred square feet per lot or dwelling unit, undeveloped natural area-five points; 
e.  Active open space minimum of seven hundred fifty square feet per lot or dwelling unit, developed and maintained-seven points; 
f.  Active open space minimum one thousand square feet per lot or dwelling unit, developed and maintained-ten points. 
6.  Pedestrian Circulation Qualifying Points. 
a.  Internal Circulation. A developed and maintained ADA pedestrian path or sidewalk that provides internal circulation within the development, including to the open space area-four points; 
b.  Internal Circulation and Linking Path. A developed and maintained ADA pedestrian path or sidewalk that provides internal circulation within the development, including to the open space area, and also provides exterior connectivity to services such as a school, park, commercial area, public transportation system, etc.-six points. 
7.  Recreational Qualifying Points. 
a.  The project includes fields, courts, swimming pools, trail amenities or other facilities that promote active recreation-four points; 
b.  The project includes a clubhouse that may include both active and passive recreational opportunities and include amenities such as kitchen and dining facilities-seven points. 
8.  Superior design development that demonstrates superior design by incorporating open space and recreational features when addressing development challenges including but not limited to preservation of environmentally sensitive lands, preservation of existing trees, incorporation of stormwater facilities or integration with the transportation system will receive an additional four points. 
C.  Infrastructure and Public Improvement Qualifying Criteria. 
1.  Street Connectivity. The PURD's streets shall be laid out and designed so as to plan for future connection to adjoining properties-four points; 
2.  Bicycle Lanes. The PURD shall provide bicycle circulation and connectivity to neighboring properties either as bicycle lanes in the right-of-way or as a part of a trail system-four points; and 
3.  Low Impact Development (LID) Stormwater. Instead of large investments in complex and costly engineering strategies for stormwater management, LID strategies integrate green space, native landscaping, natural hydrologic functions, and various other techniques to generate less runoff from developed land-seven points. 
D.  Structure Characteristics. 
1.  Energy Efficiency. 
a.  The homes within the PURD will be built at Energy Star New Home Standards-six points; 
b.  The homes within the PURD will be equipped with Energy Star qualified efficient appliances-four points.

4.  Front Porches. At least seventy-five percent of the homes have covered front porches-two points; 
5.  Exterior Materials. 
a.  At least seventy-five percent of the homes have a front facade that is at least fifty percent brick, stone or decorative material-two points; 
b.  At least seventy-five percent of the homes have complete exteriors that are at least twenty-five percent brick, stone or decorative material-two points. 
E.  An applicant may propose and request points for providing desired site design and development features that implement the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan and other plans adopted by the city provided the proposed design or improvement is not already required by city ordinance. The intent is to provide staff, the planning commission and city council as much latitude as necessary to negotiate with applicants while implementing the city's vision for future growth. 
F.  PURD Qualifying Criteria Score Sheet. The city of Woodland shall provide the desired site design and development features and associated points on a concise score sheet that shall be submitted with the PURD application and used by decision makers when determining the appropriateness of the PURD application.

16.22.160 - Open space ownership and maintenance. 
    All area shown as open space on the plats and site plans required in this chapter shall be conveyed and maintained under the following options: 
A.  If open space is suitable for general public use and a public agency agrees to maintain it, the open space, including any buildings, structures or improvements thereon, may be dedicated to the public. 
B.  If open space is appropriately intended for use solely of the residents of the development, it shall be conveyed to an association of property owners created as a nonprofit corporation under the laws of the state, through which the property owners shall own undivided interest in the open space. In such case, the developer shall file with the city copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the association. In addition, the developer shall present for recording with the final plat a declaration of covenants acceptable to the city council and city attorney, which covenants shall provide for the following: 
1.  The property owners' association will be established by the developer before any properties in the PURD are sold. 
2.  Membership in the association will be automatic and mandatory for each property buyer and any successive buyer. 
3.  Use of the common open space will be restricted as shown on the approved final plat and final site plan, and the restrictions will be permanent per WMC 16.22.350, not just for a period of years. In lieu of a covenant permanently restricting use of the common open space, the developer may convey and the city may require conveyance of the development rights to the city. 
4.  The association will be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities. 
5.  Property owners will pay their pro rata share of the cost of the insurance, taxes and maintenance. The assessment levied by the association can become a lien on the property, and foreclosures can be instituted to collect defaulted payments. 
6.  The association will be able to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs.

Lot consolidations that would combine two or more lots each having a residential dwelling unit or town home are prohibited when located in a residential zoning district, except when the consolidation would result in the creation of a principal single-family detached dwelling and a permitted accessory use. Lot consolidations not otherwise mentioned are exempt from review. If, at some point in the future, maximum lot sizes are adopted, all lot consolidations shall go through the process outlined herein. BLAs and lot consolidations may also be accomplished as part of a plat or short plat. 
(Ord. No. 1239, 8-20-2012)

    "Lot consolidation" means the combining of two or more parcels, where a greater number of parcels than originally existed is not thereby created. 
(Ord. No. 1239, 8-20-2012)

B.  The adjusted lots meet current zoning requirements related to property size including, but not limited to, minimum requirements for width, depth, and area. Whenever a lot involved in a proposed BLA does not meet minimum requirements for size prior to adjustment, the change may be approved so long as the change does not increase the existing nonconformity; 
C.  No lot shall be reconfigured or adjusted which would render access for vehicles, utilities, fire protection, or existing easements impractical to serve their purpose. Blanket utility easements existing along lot lines, that are specifically required as a condition of development approval, may be moved during a boundary line adjustment; provided, there is compliance with RCW 64.04.175 and the easement is not occupied by a utility.

Chapter 17.30 - FLOODWAY USE DISTRICT 
Sections: 

17.30.010 - Purpose. 
    The floodway use district (FW) is a zoning classification providing for uses in floodway hazard areas. Floodways are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential. The city's flood damage prevention code (Chapter 14.40) prohibits in the floodway new residential structures and limits other development to those which will not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Due to the physical restrictions to building in the floodway, the intent of this district is to provide for land uses with a low impact on the floodway, but still allow for an economic use of the land. 
(Ord. 892 § 1 (part), 1998) 
17.30.020 - Permitted uses. 
    The following are permitted uses in the FW district: 
1.  Park and recreational activities: golf courses, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat ramps, fishing areas, pedestrian and bicycle trails, and open space and other similar private and public recreational uses; 
2.  Passive agriculture: horticulture, outdoor plant nurseries, hay or field crops but no livestock; 
3.  Lawns, gardens, play areas, and other similar uses; 
4.  Utility systems, such as permanent electric lines, pipelines, sewer trunk line, water main lines and similar facilities. 
(Ord. 892 § 1 (part), 1998) 
17.30.030 - Prohibited uses.

B.  Livestock or intensive agriculture use; 
C.  Shooting (firearms) ranges; 
D.  Streets dedicated to the city, except for the continuation of an existing street that was legally constructed, or any new streets that will serve public uses in the floodway. Land uses in the FW district must be served by driveways which intersect with streets not in the floodway. 
(Ord. 1071 § 1, 2006: Ord. 892 § 1 (part), 1998) 
17.30.040 - Lots-Minimum size.

    Off-street parking in the FW district shall meet the requirements of Chapter 17.56. In addition, no parking facilities shall be located closer than fifty feet landward from the ordinary high water mark of the Lewis River. 
(Ord. 892 § 1 (part), 1998) 
17.30.100 - Fences and hedges. 
    In times of flood, the floodway contains flowing waters carrying debris. Fences and hedges can act as obstructions or dams diverting waters or otherwise exacerbating the flood hazard. Thus, care must be taken in the design and arrangement of any fences or hedges in the FW district. Therefore, the community development director shall approve the design and arrangements of all fences and hedges in the FW district. Fences and hedges in the FW district shall be no higher than six feet. Fencing shall be reviewed with respect to its impact on the flood carrying capacity of the floodway in accordance with the "no rise" considerations of 44 CFR 60.3(d)3, Regulations for the National Flood Insurance Program.

17.36.130 - Architectural and site design standards. 
A.  Title and Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to produce development that meets various objectives. These include: 
1.  Create a physical environment that emphasizes buildings and landscaping, rather than parking lots, driveways, or large signs. 
2.  Maintain the scale, texture, and architectural context of development. 
3.  Encourage creative and innovative designs for sites and building designs. 
4.  Allow for infill development that is sensitive to the existing urban design context. 
5.  Protect and enhance the business environment and property values within the city in manners that support and stimulate business and industry and also promote desirability of investment and occupancy in business and other properties. 
B.  Submittal Requirements. Site and elevation plans that are to scale and stamped by a registered architect in the State of Washington shall be submitted and approved prior to issuance of the site plan approval. 
C.  Variance from Architectural and Site Design Standards. The city recognizes that strict adherence to the standards outlined in WMC 17.36.130 may prevent innovative and desirable designs that would achieve or exceed the intents of standards. Whenever there are difficulties that result from physical peculiarities of the property which make it difficult to implement these standards, the hearing examiner shall have the authority to grant a variance from strict compliance with specific standards or requirements. The hearing examiner shall review such variance applications at an open record public hearing in accordance with the procedure outlined in WMC 19.06.070 and render decisions based on the criteria outlined in WMC 17.81.020.B, the intents of applicable standards, and applicable provisions in the Woodland Comprehensive Plan. Any such deviations so granted shall be specifically identified in the site and elevation plans. 
D.  Master Plan Required. Every commercial park/development or binding site plan that is larger than five acres in size located within the highway commercial (C-2) zoning district shall contain covenants establishing a master site and building design plan so the entire commercial project, upon completion, exhibits conformity in design style per WMC 17.36.130, the Woodland Architectural and Site Design Standards. Any part or phase of the commercial park/development or binding site plan shall exhibit conformance with the approved master plan. A copy of the draft covenants shall be submitted with the application. A copy of the recorded covenants shall be submitted prior to commencement of any on-site work for the project. 
E.  Orientation to the Street. (See Figures 4 through 6.) Intent: To ensure that buildings contribute to the liveliness and safety of streets and provide activity and interest along the street. 
1.  Buildings, along with trees and landscaping, shall be predominant rather than parking lots, driveways, or freestanding signs. Buildings should not turn their backs to the streets. 
2.  People traveling along the state highways, major arterials, and minor arterials should be able to see storefronts, windows, merchandise, and other aspects of business activity. 
3.  Features such as inset or angled corners and entrances, display windows, or corner roof features should be provided at intersections of public streets and alley entrances.

Chapter 17.56 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Prior ordinance history: Ords. 490, 622, 638, 654, 675 and 683. 

17.56.005 - Off-street parking-General requirement. 
    Every building hereafter erected shall be provided with parking spaces, and such parking spaces shall be made permanently available and be permanently maintained for parking purposes and, except for parking areas used for playground purposes in connection with schools, shall be used only for the parking of automobiles or trucks. Any areas used to provide required off-street parking shall be of such size and shape and so designed that the area will accommodate the number of cars to be provided for. If structural alterations or additions to a building or use result in additional floor space, seats, beds, employees, users, or students, as the case may be, parking shall be provided as required in this chapter according to the total development, the existing, plus the addition. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.010 - Number of parking spaces required. 
A.  All developments in all zoning districts shall provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in question. 
B.  The presumptions established by this chapter are that: 
1.  A development must comply with the parking standards set forth in Sections 17.56.030 through 17.56.060 to satisfy the requirement stated in subsection A of this section; and 
2.  Any development that does meet these standards is in compliance. However, Sections 17.56.030 through 17.56.050 are only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered, as provided in Section 17.56.020. 
C.  When determination of the number of parking spaces required by Sections 17.56.030 through 17.56.050 results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space. 
D.  The council recognizes that the minimum space standards given in Sections 17.56.030 through 17.56.050 cannot and do not cover every possible situation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the permit issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking requirements using the minimum space standards as a guide. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.020 - Flexibility in administration allowed. 
A.  The city recognizes that, due to the particularities in any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in Sections 17.56.030 through 17.56.050 may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive standards of Sections 17.56.030 through 17.56.050 and may require more parking or less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in subsection 17.56.010(A). 
B.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in Sections 17.56.030 through 17.56.050 when it finds that: 
1.  A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly; 
2.  A business is primarily oriented to walk-in trade. 
C.  In the event the permit-issuing authority authorizes a deviation from the presumptive standards, the occupancy permit for the use or structure shall contain language describing the nature of the use and the parking required. Such deviation shall only be authorized during the period in which the stated use is in effect. Prior to undertaking any change in use, the owner or tenant shall request amendment of the occupancy permit to reflect the new use and shall comply with such modified parking requirements. 
D.  If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by Sections 17.56.030 through 17.56.050 for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of parking requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 17.84. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.030 - Off-street parking-Commercial districts. 
    Off-street parking requirements in commercial districts shall be as follows: 
A.  C-1 Central Business District. Parking requirements shall be based on the number of trips generated by the use. 
1.  Thirty trips or fewer: No off-street parking required. 
2.  Greater than thirty trips: One parking space for each four hundred square feet of the total floor area within all buildings to be served. 
B.  C-2 Highway Commercial District. Food stores, markets, and shopping centers having a gross floor area of less than three thousand square feet, exclusive of basement areas, one parking space for each three hundred square feet of total floor area of the building(s). Food stores, markets, and shopping centers having a gross floor area of three thousand square feet or more, exclusive of basement areas, one parking space for each two hundred square feet of total floor area of the building(s). For all other C-2 uses, one parking space for each three hundred square feet of gross floor area with a minimum of four customer parking spaces per use. 
C.  C-3 Neighborhood Commercial District. One parking space for each two hundred square feet of gross floor area with a minimum of five customer parking spaces. 
D.  The foregoing shall not apply to the Davidson Street, at blocks 100, 200, 300 and Park Street at block 500. This exemption shall be in effect for five years from the effective date of this ordinance, and shall be revisited for reconsideration in five years by the city council. 
E.  This code change will supersede the current WMC for off-site parking requirements in WMC 17.20.060, except for the residential portion. In the residential portion of the downtown Commercial (C-1) blocks identified in "D" above, one parking space will be required for each unit. 
(Ord. 1101 § 1, 2007; Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
(Ord. No. 1164, § 1, 9-8-2009; Ord. No. 1356, § 1, 4-18-2016) 
17.56.035 - Off-street parking-Floodway use district. 
    All developments in the floodway use district shall provide adequate off-street parking for visitors, employees and delivery vehicles. The number of off-street parking spaces for developments in this district shall be determined by the public works director and based upon the information in the proponent's SEPA checklist or impact statement. Appeal procedures for administrative decisions are set forth in WMC 19.06 and 19.08. 
(Ord. 892 § 3, 1998) 
(Ord. No. 1253, § 4, 11-19-2012) 
17.56.040 - Off-street parking-Light industrial district. 
    Off-street parking in the light industrial district shall be as follows: 
A.  Parking and loading facilities shall be located at the side or rear of buildings; provided, that necessary parking and loading may be permitted at the front only when appropriately landscaped according to the standards set out in Chapter 17.44. 
B.  To insure adequate overall parking facilities, space for parking must be related to both the size of the building and number of expected employees using the same size building, depending on the nature of the operation or building use. Owners must provide parking facilities either on-site or at a satellite facility, based on either subsection (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this section, whichever provides the most parking spaces. 
1.  Parking in relation to personnel: 
a.  One space for each two plant employees on maximum shift; 
b.  One space for each managerial personnel; 
c.  One visitor parking space for every ten managerial personnel; 
d.  No less than four per plant site.

b.  One space for each seven hundred square feet of gross floor area used for manufacturing; 
c.  One space for each four hundred square feet of office floor area. 
C.  Up to thirty-five percent of the employee parking spaces may be compact spaces. 
D.  In addition to the standards set forth in subsection B of this section, every owner of a facility in the light industrial district shall maintain enough parking spaces for personnel either on-site or at a satellite parking facility so as to prevent personnel from parking in unauthorized locations either in or adjacent to the light industrial district. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.045 - Off-street parking-Heavy industrial district. 
    All developments in the heavy industrial district shall provide adequate off-street parking for employees, delivery vehicles and visitors. The number of off-street parking spaces for developments in this district shall be determined by the public works director and based upon information in the proponent's SEPA checklist or impact statement.

(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997: Ord. 809 § 6, 1996) 
(Ord. No. 1232, 3-19-2012) 
17.56.060 - Parking space dimensions. 
A.  Subject to subsections B and C of this section, each parking space shall have an area of not less than one hundred eighty square feet exclusive of drives and aisles, and a width of not less than nine feet. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain within them the rectangular area required by this section. 
B.  Where otherwise allowed in this chapter, the allowed percentage of parking spaces need contain a rectangular area of only seven and one-half feet in width by fifteen feet in length. If such spaces are provided, they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or compact cars only. 
C.  Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking, the dimensions of such parking spaces shall be not less than twenty-two feet by nine feet. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.070 - Required widths of parking area aisles. 
    Parking area aisle widths shall conform to the following table, which varies the width requirement according to the angle of parking: 
Parking Angle Aisle Width 0° 30° 45° 60° 90° One-way traffic 13' 11' 13' 18' 24' Two-way traffic 19' 20' 21' 23' 24'  
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.080 - General design requirements. 
A.  Unless no other practicable alternative is available, vehicle accommodation areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to extraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one or two dwelling units, although backing onto arterial streets is discouraged. 
B.  Vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements. 
C.  Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public right-of-way. Such areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall, vegetation, or other obstruction. 
D.  Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians and without interfering with parking areas. 
E.  Unless specifically allowed in the zoning district, no required yard shall be used to satisfy off-street parking requirements. 
F.  The location and design of all entrances, exits and drives shall be subject to the approval of the director of public works and, in the case where the matter is before it, the planning commission. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.090 - Materials-Design-Lighting. 
A.  Vehicle accommodation areas, including lanes for drive-in windows, shall be graded and surfaced with asphalt, concrete or other material that will provide equivalent protection against potholes, erosion, and dust. Design of pavement section for vehicle accommodation areas shall be approved by the director of public works. The parking area shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of surface water to the satisfaction of the director of public works. 
B.  Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection A of this section shall be appropriately demarcated with painted lines or other markings. 
C.  Vehicle accommodation areas shall be properly maintained in all respects. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, vehicle accommodation area surfaces shall be kept in good condition (free from potholes, weeds, dust, trash, and debris, etc.) and parking space lines or markings shall be kept clearly visible and distinct. 
D.  Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking facility shall be arranged so as to reflect light away from any adjoining residential area. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.100 - Joint use of required parking spaces. 
A.  One parking area may contain required spaces for different uses, but except as otherwise provided in this section, the required space assigned to one use may not be credited to any other use. 
B.  To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to both uses. For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on Monday through Friday but is generally ninety percent vacant on weekends, another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with ninety percent of the spaces on that lot. Or, if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to fifty percent of capacity on days other than Sunday, another development could make use of fifty percent of the church lot's spaces on those other days. 
C.  If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two or more principal uses involves satellite parking spaces, then the provisions of Section 17.56.110 are also applicable. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.110 - Satellite parking. 
A.  If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this section. These off-site spaces are referred to in this section as satellite parking spaces. 
B.  All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee use) must be located within eight hundred feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with such parking, or within eight hundred feet of the lot on which the use associated with such parking is located if the use is not housed within any principal building. Satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance. Satellite parking shall not be located across a minor arterial or larger street unless provisions are made for shuttle service. 
C.  The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present satisfactory written evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an acknowledgment that the continuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of a parking spaces. 
D.  Persons who obtain satellite parking spaces in accordance with this section shall not be held accountable for ensuring that the satellite parking areas from which they obtain their spaces satisfy the design requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.120 - Special provisions for lots with existing buildings. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, whenever: (A) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of this chapter, and (B) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and (C) the parking requirements of Section 17.56.010 that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking, then the developer need only comply with the requirements of Section 17.56.010 to the extent that (i) parking space is practicably available on the lot where the development is located, and (ii) satellite parking space is reasonably available as provided in Section 17.56.100. However, if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably available, then it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that the developer obtain satellite parking when it does become available. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.130 - Temporary use of parking spaces for nonparking use. 
A.  For special events or sales, a business may temporarily use some of its parking spaces for nonparking use provided the use meets the criteria of this section. Only the business for which the parking spaces are intended may use their spaces for temporary non-parking use. A business cannot lease or otherwise allow their parking spaces to be used by another entity unless it is a non-profit charity organization or is in conjunction with a community-wide festival, such as Planter's Day. 
B.  No more than two parking spaces or fifteen percent of the parking spaces for the business, whichever is greater, shall be used for the temporary event. The use of the parking space will not impede safe traffic circulation or sight-distance, block or impede fire lanes, create other hazards, or cause a situation where neighboring businesses or uses unwillingly bear the brunt of providing parking during the event. Temporary uses lasting ten days or less do not need to receive prior approval from the city. However, the city, upon determining the temporary use of the parking space is causing a hazard or routing parking to unwilling neighboring businesses or uses, may direct the business to modify the temporary use or remove it. 
C.  For special events or sales lasting longer than ten days but no longer than one hundred fifty days, the business must receive prior approval from the city's development review committee (DRC). The applicant must submit a master land use application, site plan and pay the site plan review fee. The DRC may permit the temporary use upon determining the use of the parking spaces meets the criteria given in the above paragraph. 
D.  Any nonparking use of parking spaces longer than one hundred fifty days or which uses more parking spaces than allowed above must receive a temporary use permit per subsection 17.81.020(C). 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.140 - Parking facility plans. 
    Site plans for any multifamily (MDR and HDR), commercial, industrial or conditional use (as required by Chapter 17.72) shall include the location, dimension, and number of parking spaces required by this title. Any proposed change to existing buildings or uses in floor area, seating, number of beds, or use shall include with their plans the location, dimension and number of parking spaces required by this title. 
(Ord. 939 § 17, 2000: Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.150 - Landscaping-Screening. 
    Landscaping and screening of parking facilities shall be those specified in the standards of each appropriate zoning district or conditional use requirements, whichever applies. 
(Ord. 863 § 1 (part), 1997) 
17.56.160 - Electric vehicle charging station spaces. 
A.  Purpose. For all parking lots or garages. 
B.  Number. No minimum number of charging station spaces is required. 
C.  Minimum Parking Requirements. An electric vehicle charging station space may be included in the calculation for minimum required parking spaces that are required pursuant to other provisions of code. 
D.  Location and Design Criteria. The provision of electric vehicle parking will vary based on the design and use of the primary parking lot. The following required and additional locational and design criteria are provided in recognition of the various parking lot layout options. 
1.  Where provided, parking for electric vehicle charging purposes is required to include the following: 
a.  Signage. Each charging station space shall be posted with signage indicating the space is only for electric vehicle charging purposes. Days and hours of operations shall be included if time limits or tow away provisions are to be enforced. 
b.  Maintenance. Charging station equipment shall be maintained in all respects, including the functioning of the charging equipment. A phone number or other contact information shall be provided on the charging station equipment for reporting when the equipment is not functioning or other problems are encountered. 
c.  Accessibility. Where charging station equipment is provided within an adjacent pedestrian circulation area, such as a sidewalk or accessible route to the building entrance, the charging equipment shall be located so as not to interfere with accessibility requirements of WAC 51-50-005. 
d.  Lighting. Where charging station equipment is installed, adequate site lighting shall exist, unless charging is for daytime purposes only. 
2.  Parking for electric vehicles should also consider the following: 
a.  Notification. Information on the charging station, identifying voltage and amperage levels and any time of use, fees, or safety information. 
b.  Signage. Installation of directional signs at the parking lot entrance and at appropriate decision points to effectively guide motorists to the charging station space(s). 
E.  Data Collection. To allow for maintenance and notification, the local permitting agency will require the owners of any private new electric vehicle infrastructure station that will be publicly available (see definition "electric vehicle charging station - public") to provide information on the station's geographic location, date of installation, equipment type and model, and owner contact information.

Chapter 17.60 - PRE-EXISTING NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1278, § 1, adopted September 8, 2015, repealed the former Chapter 17.60, §§ 17.60.010-17.60.080, and enacted a new Chapter 17.60 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.60 pertained to pre-existing uses and structures and derived from Ord. No. 490, 1979; Ord. No. 939, 2000; Ord. No. 940, 2000 and Ord. No. 1055, 2005. 

17.60.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations applicable to non-conforming lots, uses and structures. These regulations distinguish legally established non-conforming lots, uses and structures from illegal non-conforming lots, uses and structures. The intent of this chapter is to discourage the expansion, enlargement or intensification of legal non-conforming uses and to establish a procedure to recognize legal non-conforming lots, uses and structures (provided they are not expanded, enlarged, intensified, removed or abandoned). The intent is not to discourage owners from performing routine maintenance or making improvements to a structure or a lot. Furthermore, with respect to illegal non-conforming lots, uses and structures, the intent of this chapter is to prohibit and abate illegal non-conforming lots, uses and structures. 
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1, 9-8-2015) 
17.60.020 - Definitions. 
    "Alteration of non-conforming structures" means any change or rearrangement in the supporting members of existing buildings, such as bearing walls, columns, beams, girders, or interior partitions, as well as any changes in doors, windows, means of egress or ingress or any enlargement to or diminution of a building or structure, horizontally or vertically, or the moving of a building from one location to another. This definition excludes normal repair and maintenance, such as painting or roof replacement, but includes more substantial changes. 
    "Expansion," "enlargement," or "intensification" means any increase in a dimension, size, area, volume, or height, any increase in the area of use, any placement of a structure or part thereof where none existed before, any addition of a site feature such a deck, patio, fence, driveway or parking area, any improvement that would allow the land to be more intensely developed, any move of operations to a new location on the property, or any increase in intensity of use based on a review of the original and historical nature, function or purpose of the non-conforming use, the hours of operation, traffic, parking, noise, exterior storage, signs, exterior lighting, types of operations, types of goods or services offered, odors, noise, area of operation, number of employees, and other factors deemed relevant by the city. 
    "Intensification of use, non-residential" includes, in addition to the description in WMC 17.60.020(5), any change or expansion of a non-residential use that results in both a greater than ten percent increase in parking need or the director of public works determines there is a material likelihood the use will have a negative impact regarding traffic generation, noise, smoke, glare, odors, hazardous materials, water use, and/or sewage generation, shall be an "intensification of use" for the purposes of this chapter. 
    "Intensification of use, residential" includes, in addition to the description in WMC 17.60.020(5), any change to a residence use which will result in an increase in the number of bedrooms is an "intensification of use" for the purposes of this chapter. 
    "Lot of record" means (a) an undeveloped lot, tract or parcel of land shown on an officially recorded short plat or subdivision or (b) a parcel of land officially recorded or registered as a unit of property with the county auditor, assessor or treasurer and described by platted lot number or by metes and bounds and lawfully established for conveyancing purposes on the date of recording of the instrument that first references the lot. Use of the term "lot of record" does not mean that the lot was created in conformity with the legal regulatory requirements for subdivision of property in accordance with Chapter 58.17 RCW. 
    "Non-conforming lot" means a lot that, at the time of its establishment, met the minimum lot size requirements for the zone in which it is located but which, because of subsequent changes to the minimum lot size applicable to that zone, no longer complies with requirements. 
    "Non-conforming structure" means structure that complied with zoning and development regulations at the time it was built but which, because of subsequent changes to the zoning and/or development regulations, no longer fully complies with those regulations in regards to height, setbacks, lot coverage, size, or area. 
    "Non-conforming use" means a use of property that was allowed at the time the use was established but which, because of changes in zoning regulation, is no longer permitted. 
    "Pre-existing" means that which existed prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title. 
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1, 9-8-2015) 
17.60.030 - Abatement of illegal non-conforming use, structure or lot. 
    The city may take such action as it deems necessary to abate or to enjoin any illegal non-conforming use, structure, lot or other site improvement when the owner or the owner's agent, successor, tenant, occupant or assignee fails to discontinue such use or fails to remove such non-conforming structure after written notice from the city. Such notice shall be sent to the owner at the address shown in the current online records of the county treasurer and assessor. 
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1, 9-8-2015) 
17.60.040 - Completion of structure. 
    Nothing contained in this title shall require any change in the plans, construction, alteration, or designated use of a structure for which a building permit has been legally issued and construction commenced prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title and subsequent amendments thereto. 
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1, 9-8-2015) 
17.60.050 - Non-conforming uses. 
A.  A non-conforming use may not increase in intensity or be made more non-conforming without special permission from the hearing examiner set forth in a conditional use permit obtained as per Chapter 17.72. 
B.  A structure containing a non-conforming use may be enlarged or extended only by special permission of the hearing examiner through a conditional use permit as per Chapter 17.72. The extension of a non-conforming use within a structure existing on the date the ordinance codified in this chapter was amended that was built for the non-conforming use is not considered an extension of a non-conforming use. For example, if a building was constructed for the non-conforming use, but the use did not fill the entire building, expanding the use into the empty portion of the building does not constitute the extension of the non-conforming use. 
C.  No non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or zoning district in which it is located. If moved, it must be to a district in which the use is permitted. 
D.  If any non-conforming use ceases for any reason for a period of one year, any subsequent use shall conform to the regulations specified by this title for the district in which such use is located. 
1.  Standard evidence that the use has been maintained over time includes: 
a.  Utility bills; 
b.  Income tax records; 
c.  Business licenses; 
d.  Listings in telephone, business, and Polk directories; 
e.  Advertisements in dated publications, e.g. trade magazines; and/or 
f.  Building, land use, or development permits. 
E.  The hearing examiner may recognize a legal non-conforming use and/or may authorize reinstatement of a non-conforming use. The procedure for recognizing and/or reinstatement shall be the same as for conditional use permits as outlined in Chapter 17.72 and conditions may be imposed as part of reinstatement. 
F.  A non-conforming use cannot be changed to another kind of non-conforming use. The non-conforming use must remain either the prior non-conforming use legally established or a use permitted in the zoning district. If a non-conforming use is changed to a conforming use, the use cannot be changed back to the prior non-conforming use, unless permitted by the hearing examiner. 
G.  If a structure containing a non-conforming use is destroyed by any cause to an extent exceeding fifty percent of the cost of replacement of the structure, using new materials, a future use of the property shall conform to the provisions of this title. See Section 17.60.080 for single-family dwelling exemptions. 
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1, 9-8-2015) 
17.60.060 - Non-conforming structures. 
A.  A non-conforming structure may be continued and maintained in reasonable repair and safe condition, provided that the structure is not enlarged, extended, or increased without special permission from the hearing examiner through a conditional use permit as per Chapter 17.72. A non-conforming structure may not be made more non-conforming. 
B.  A non-conforming structure may not be moved in whole or part to any other portion of the lot of zoning district in which it is located, unless the move brings the structure into conformance. 
C.  A non-conforming structure may be used for a use permitted in the zoning district where the structure is located. In order to accommodate a permitted use, the structure may be repaired, modified, or altered, internally and externally; provided such repairs and modifications (1) do not increase the non-conformance of the structure and (2) that such repairs and modifications satisfy the International Building Code standards. 
D.  In addition, a non-conforming structure as described in subsection (C) may be modified or altered in such a manner that it conforms to the standards of the district, this title, and the International Building Code. 
E.  If a non-conforming structure is destroyed by any cause to an extent exceeding fifty percent of the cost of replacement of the structure, using new materials, a future structure of the property shall conform to the provisions of this title. See Section 17.60.080 for single-family exemptions. 
F.  A non-conforming structure that is made conforming will not be allowed to become non-conforming again, without following the variance process outlined in Chapter 17.81. 
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1, 9-8-2015) 
17.60.070 - Non-conforming lots. 
    Any permitted use may be established on an undersized lot that cannot satisfy lot size or width requirements of this title, provided that: 
A.  All other applicable zoning development standards, such as building setback requirements and lot coverage requirements, are met or a variance has been granted; 
B.  The lot was legally created and satisfied the lot size and width requirements applicable at the time of creation; 
C.  No unsafe condition is created by permitting development on the non-conforming lot; and 
D.  The lot was not created as a "special tract" to protect critical areas, provide open space, or as a public or private access tract. 
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1, 9-8-2015) 
17.60.080 - Single-family dwellings. 
A.  Single-family dwellings, including manufactured homes, existing in the C-1, C-2, C-3, I-1, or I-2 districts at the time of passage of the ordinance codified in this title shall be allowed to remain, and any addition or improvements thereto shall meet the standards of the LDR-6 zoning district. 
B.  In any zone, a single-family dwelling destroyed by any cause to any extent, shall be allowed to be improved or reconstructed, provided the setback standards of the LDR-6 district are maintained or provided that the original footprint of the destroyed dwelling is maintained. 
(Ord. No. 1278, § 1, 9-8-2015) 
17.60.090 - Inquiries concerning non-conforming status. 
A.  An owner or agent claiming a legal non-conforming use, structure or lot may petition the city to formally recognize the legal non-conforming use, structure or lot. Initial city review will be by the development review committee and is the sole method to obtain recognition. The owner/agent has the burden of showing legal non-conforming status. Establishing legal non-conforming status is done by application to the City of Woodland and shall be accompanied by the following: 
1.  A narrative including the following information: 
a.  Date the use was established, or lot was created, and date the structure was completed; 
b.  Initial use at time of establishment, creation, or completion; 
c.  Chronological list of subsequent uses; 
d.  Other information as determined by the DRC or the applicant that is necessary to demonstrate non-conforming status. 
2.  Proof of business operation if a business use is claimed. Proof of business operation includes, but is not limited to, state and local business licenses, state business and occupancy tax returns, and state sales tax returns. 
3.  Certificate of occupancy. 
4.  If the property has been leased, a copy of the leases. 
5.  Any advertisement for sale of the property; any advertisement for lease of the property. 
6.  If multi-family use is claimed, proof of use as a multi-family unit during the prior twenty-four months and proof of compliance with WMC Title 17. 
7.  A filing fee as determined by the city council. 
B.  The owner/agent may provide narrative statements to establish facts for which there is insufficient documentary evidence. Narrative statements shall be provided in affidavit or certificate form. 
C.  Once the application packet is deemed complete, a Notice of Application will be published in the newspaper of record, posted on site, and sent to all adjacent property owners within three hundred feet of the subject property. A fourteen-day public comment period is provided. The development review committee will issue a notice of decision at the close of the fourteen-day comment period, after considering all documentation provided by the applicant and any comments or documentation provided by the public or other agency. 
D.  Official written recognition by city officials or the planning staff of legal non-conforming shall be given greater weight than informal oral statements by city officials or the planning staff. Oral statements which identify the date and time of the oral statement, the persons present, the question asked will be given greater weight than general statements lacking such details. There is a rebuttable presumption that a business was not operated on the property and the business use was abandoned unless the documentary proof described in subsection (A) is provided. "Leasing" property is not a separate independent business use for purposes of this chapter but is considered a form of title. 
E.  The owner/agent shall have twenty days to appeal the decision to the hearing examiner. The hearing examiner shall review the decision based on the materials submitted by the owner/agent at the time of application and on any supplementary material provided by the city. The petitioner shall pay a filing fee in an amount set by city council resolution. The petitioner shall reimburse the city for fifty percent of the hearing examiner expense for this or any other review, application or petition under this chapter. 
F.  No building permit will be issued on a non-recognized non-conformity.

17.81.010 - Purpose.

A.  To ensure procedural due process and appearance of fairness in certain land use regulatory hearings; and 
B.  To provide an efficient and effective land use regulatory system which integrates the public hearing and decision-making process for certain land use matters. 
(Ord. 567 § 3, 1984) 
17.81.020 - Creation of land use hearing examiner. 
    The office of Woodland municipal land use hearing examiner, hereinafter referred to as "examiner," is created. The examiner shall interpret, review, and implement land use regulations and policies as provided in this chapter or by other ordinances of the city, including but not limited to the following: 
A.  Conditional uses per Chapter 17.72. Applications for conditional uses when the zoning ordinance sets forth the specific uses to be made subject to conditional use permits. 
B.  Major Variances. A major variance shall be defined as a variance to a measurable zoning standard which does not fall under a category of minor variances as outlined in WMC 17.81.180.A. The examiner shall decide upon application for major variances from the terms of this title; provided that any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assume that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon uses of other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property on behalf of which the application was filed is located; and: 
1.  That such variance is necessary, because of special circumstances or conditions relating to the size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with use, rights, and privileges, permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located; 
2.  That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated; 
3.  If such permit for variance is denied, no reapplication shall be made within one year from the date of denial; 
4.  An approved variance will go with or be assigned to the subject property and shall not be transferable to another property; and 
5.  No use variance shall be granted except for lawfully created pre-existing uses in accordance with WMC 17.60. 
Expiration of Approval-Major Variances. Approval of a major variance shall be void after three years, unless a building permit has been issued and substantial construction has taken place. The community development director, for good cause, may extend approval for no more than one year. If a variance is specifically related to an approved phasing program, the validity of the variance shall be limited only by the phasing plan. Approval expiration shall apply to all applications deemed complete on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
C.  Violations. Recognizing the fact that a building may be erected in good faith with every intent to comply with the provisions of this title in respect to the location of the building upon the lots and the size and location of required yards, and that it may later be determined that such building does not comply in every detail with such requirements, although not violating the spirit or intent of this title, the examiner may issue a waiver of violation, subject to such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare. 
D.  All appeals regarding SEPA matters, shoreline exemptions and supplemental environmental impact statements. 
E.  Issuance of replats, plat vacations, shoreline development permits, shoreline conditional use permits and shoreline variances. See also Section 19.08.030 describing decision making and appeal authority of the hearing examiner.

Failure to raise a specific challenge to such condition or exaction shall constitute a waiver of such issue and a failure to exhaust an administrative remedy. 
B.  In deciding and resolving any such issue, the examiner may consider all law applicable to the city. Should the examiner determine that, but for a taking without just compensation or a violation of substantive due process of law, imposition of any such condition would be required by standard, regulation, or ordinance the examiner shall so state in the decision and so report to the city council. In lieu of failing to impose such condition, the examiner shall first provide the city with due opportunity to provide just compensation.

A.  Purpose. When the city receives a project permit application, consistency between the proposed project and the applicable regulations and comprehensive plan should be determined through the process in this chapter and the city's environmental policy ordinance. 
B.  Consistency. During project permit application review, the city shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the development regulations applicable to the proposed project. In the absence of applicable development regulations, the city shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the city's adopted comprehensive plan. This determination of consistency shall include the following: 
1.  The type of land use permitted at the site, including uses that may be allowed under certain circumstances, if the criteria for their approval have been satisfied; and 
2.  The level of development, such as units per acre, density of residential development in urban growth areas, or other measures of density; and 
3.  Availability and adequacy of infrastructure and public facilities identified in the comprehensive plan, if the plan or development regulations provide for funding of these facilities as required by RCW Chapter 36.70A; and 
4.  Character of the development, such as development standards. (RCW 36.70B.030, 36.70B.040). 
(Ord. 817 § 2 (part), 1996) 
19.04.020 - Initial SEPA analysis. 
A.  The city shall also review the project permit application under the requirements of the State Environmental Policy Act ("SEPA"), RCW Chapter 43.21C, the SEPA Rules, WAC Chapter 197-11, and the city's environmental policy ordinance, Chapter 15.04, and shall: 
1.  Determine whether the applicable regulations require studies that adequately analyze all of the project permit application's specific probable adverse environmental impacts; 
2.  Determine if the applicable regulations require measures that adequately address such environmental impacts; 
3.  Determine whether additional studies are required and/or whether the project permit application should be considered with additional mitigation measures; 
4.  Provide prompt and coordinated review by government agencies and the public on compliance with applicable environmental laws and plans, including mitigation for specific project impacts that have not been considered and addressed at the plan or development regulation level. 
B.  In its review of a project permit application, the city may determine that the requirements for environmental analysis, protection and mitigation measures in the applicable development regulations, comprehensive plan and/or in other applicable local, state or federal laws provide adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of the application. 
C.  If the city bases or conditions its approval of the project permit application on compliance with the requirements or mitigation measures described in subsection (A) of this section, the city shall not impose additional mitigation under SEPA during project review. 
D.  A comprehensive plan, development regulation or other applicable local, state or federal law provides adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of an application when: 
1.  The impacts have been avoided or otherwise mitigated; and 
2.  The city has designated as acceptable certain levels of service, land use designations, development standards or other land use planning required or allowed by RCW Chapter 36.70A. 
E.  In its decision whether a specific adverse environmental impact has been addressed by an existing rule or law of another agency with jurisdiction with environmental expertise with regard to a specific environmental impact, the city shall consult orally or in writing with that agency and may expressly defer to that agency. In making this deferral, the city shall base or condition its project approval on compliance with these other existing rules or laws. 
F.  Nothing in this section limits the authority of the city in its review or mitigation of a project to adopt or otherwise rely on environmental analyses and requirements under other laws, as provided by RCW Chapter 43.21C. 
(Ord. 817 § 2 (part), 1996) 
19.04.030 - Categorically exempt and planned actions. 
A.  Categorically Exempt. Actions categorically exempt under RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a) do not require environmental review or the preparation of an environmental impact statement. An action that is categorically exempt under the rules adopted by the Department of Ecology (WAC Chapter 197-11) may not be conditioned or denied under SEPA. (RCW 43.21C.031). 
B.  Planned Actions. 
1.  A planned action does not require a threshold determination or the preparation of an environmental impact statement under SEPA, but is subject to environmental review and mitigation under SEPA. 
2.  A "planned action" means one or more types of project action that: 
a.  Are designated planned actions by an ordinance or resolution adopted by the city; 
b.  Have had the significant impacts adequately addressed in an environmental impact statement prepared in conjunction with: 
i.  A comprehensive plan or subarea plan adopted under RCW Chapter 36.70A; or 
ii.  A fully contained community, a master planned resort, a master planned development or a phased project; 
c.  Are subsequent or implementing projects for the proposals listed in subsection (B)(2)(b) of this section; 
d.  Are located within an urban growth area, as defined in RCW 36.70A.030;

f.  Are consistent with the city's comprehensive plan adopted under RCW Chapter 36.70A. (RCW 43.21C.031). 
C.  Limitation on Planned Actions. The city shall limit planned actions to certain types of development or to specific geographical areas that are less extensive than the jurisdictional boundaries of the city, and may limit a planned action to a time period identified in the environmental impact statement or in the ordinance or resolution designating the planned action under RCW 36.70A.040. (RCW 43.21C.031). 
D.  Limitations on SEPA Review. During project review, the city shall not reexamine alternatives to or hear appeals on the items identified in Section 19.04.010(B), except for issues of code interpretation. Project review shall be used to identify specific project design and conditions relating to the character of development, such as the details of site plans, curb cuts, drainage swales, the payment of impact fees, or other measures to mitigate a proposal's probable adverse environmental impacts. (RCW 36.70B.030(3)). 
(Ord. 817 § 2 (part), 1996)

The parties to an appeal may agree to extend these time periods; and 
4.  Any extension of time mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the director. 
B.  The time limits established by subsection (A) of this section do not apply if a project permit application: 
1.  Requires an amendment to the comprehensive plan or a development regulation; 
2.  Requires approval of a new fully contained community as provided in RCW 36.70A.350, a master planned resort as provided in RCW 36.70A.360, or the siting of an essential public facility as provided in RCW 36.70A.200; or

No administrative appeals shall be allowed for other actions and/or determinations taken or made related to the SEPA reviews (such as a determination as to who is the lead agency, a determination as to whether a proposal is categorically exempt, scoping of EIS, draft EIS adequacy, etc.). 
Except as provided in WMC 19.06.050(A)(2), the appeal shall consolidate any allowed appeals of procedural and substantive determinations under SEPA with a hearing or appeal on the underlying governmental action in a single simultaneous hearing before the hearing examiner. The hearing or appeal shall be one at which the hearing examiner will consider either the city's decision or a recommendation on the proposed underlying governmental action. If no hearing or appeal on the underlying governmental action is otherwise provided, then no administrative SEPA appeal is allowed, except as allowed under WMC 19.06.050(A)(2). 
Any appeal of a procedural or substantive determination under SEPA issued at the same time as the decision on a project action shall be filed within fourteen days after a notice of decision under RCW 36.70B.130 or after other notice that the decision has been made and is appealable. In order to allow public comment on a DNS prior to requiring an administrative appeal to be filed, this appeal period shall be extended for an additional seven days if the appeal is of a DNS for which public comment is required. For threshold determinations issued prior to a decision on a project action, any administrative appeal shall be filed within fourteen days after notice that the determination has been made and is appealable. 
2.  SEPA appeals that are not required to be consolidated with a hearing or appeal on the underlying governmental action include: 
a.  An appeal of a determination of significance (DS); 
b.  An appeal of a procedural determination made by an agency when the agency is a project proponent, or is funding a project, and chooses to conduct its review, including any appeals of its procedural determinations, prior to submitting an application for a project permit; 
c.  An appeal of a procedural determination made by an agency on a nonproject action; and 
d.  An appeal to the local legislative authority under RCW 43.21C.060 or other applicable state statutes. 
3.  All procedural and substantive SEPA appeals shall be initiated by filing a written notice of SEPA administrative appeal, accompanied with the applicable appeal fee. The written notice of appeal shall include: 
a.  The name and address of the party or agency filing the appeal; 
b.  An identification of the specific proposal and specific SEPA actions or determinations related to conditioning, lack of conditioning or denial of an action for which appeal is sought; and,

(Ord. No. 1276, 8-3-2013) 
19.10.030 - Exemptions. 
    The following are exempt from the site plan review provisions of this chapter unless otherwise classified as a Type I or II site plan review or a binding site plan: 
A.  New construction of or modification to existing single-family detached and duplex residential dwellings within an approved plat. 
B.  Modifications to the interior of an existing structure that does not change the use or the degree of a use. 
C.  Subdivisions, short plats, boundary line adjustments, and lot consolidations subject to WMC Title 16. 
D.  The installation or replacement of underground utilities. 
E.  Any change in commercial or industrial land use to another commercial or industrial land use permitted in the applicable zoning district.

L.  Other development determined by the development review committee to be exempt because it does not result in an appreciable increase in land use activity or intensity or in adverse off-site impacts, does not trigger review under the adopted stormwater ordinance, and because the city can assure the development complies with applicable standards without site plan review. 
(Ord. No. 1276, 8-3-2013) 
19.10.040 - Site plan review types and procedures. 
A.  Except for exempt activities listed in WMC 19.10.030, site plan reviews shall be classified and processed as follows: 
1.  Type I Site Plan Review. Type I site plan reviews are typically relatively minor in nature, consistent with the zoning of surrounding land uses, and do not have a substantial impact on the natural and built environment. Type I applications are approved by the community development director or his/her designee without public notice and without a public hearing. A pre-application conference is not required unless requested by the applicant. The following are classified as Type I site plan reviews: 
a.  Changes in use of an existing structure or site not exempt under WMC 19.10.030. 
b.  Any development or change of use that will result in thirty or fewer PM peak trips and that requires payment of a traffic impact fee. Trips shall be based on the latest edition of the International Transportation Engineer's Trip Generation Manual or substantial evidence by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Washington with expertise in traffic engineering. 
c.  New construction or expansions of existing construction that does not exceed any of the following: 
i.  Four thousand square feet of additional floor area; 
ii.  Twenty new parking spaces; or 
iii.  Four new multifamily residential units, except as provided for in WMC 19.10.030. 
2.  Type II Site Plan Review. Type II site plan reviews are typically more substantial in nature and may have potential incompatibility with surrounding zoning or land uses or may have a more substantial impact on the natural and built environment. Type II reviews are approved by the development review committee with public notice and an opportunity for comment. A pre-application conference is required. The following are classified as Type II site plan reviews: 
a.  Any development which is not listed as a Type I site plan in subsection (A)(1) of this section or listed as exempt under WMC 19.10.030. 
b.  Any development subject to SEPA pursuant to WMC Chapter 15.04 (Environmental Policy). 
c.  Any development or change of use that will result in thirty-one or more PM peak trips, based on the latest edition of the International Transportation Engineer's Trip Generation Manual, or substantial evidence by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Washington with expertise in traffic engineering. 
3.  Binding Site Plan Reviews. A binding site plan functions as an alternative to dividing commercial or industrial property through the platting process. A binding site plan is required for any proposal which involves the division of commercial or industrial property for the purposes of sale, lease, or transfer of ownership without completing the platting process pursuant to WMC Title 16 and RCW Chapter 58.17. 
a.  There are two types of binding site plans: 
i.  Binding Site Plan-New Developments. This type of binding site plan includes all applications to create legal lots in conjunction with a new development. Any binding site plan of this type less than five acres in size shall be administratively approved by the development review committee. Land division associated with any binding site plan of this type five acres or greater in size shall first be approved by city council with a recommendation by the planning commission (preliminary binding site plan approval). Following preliminary approval of the proposed land division, staff shall administratively approve proposed site improvements. 
ii.  Binding Site Plan-Existing Developments. This type of binding site plan includes all applications to create legal lots in conjunction with an existing development or when no development is proposed. Any binding site plan of this type that is less than five acres shall be administratively approved by the development review committee. Any binding site plan of this type five (5) acres or greater shall be approved by city council with a recommendation by the planning commission. 
b.  A pre-application conference is required for all binding site plan applications. Binding site plans shall be completed consistent with the requirements and provisions of RCW 58.17.035 and this chapter and shall be valid for the same period as a Type I or II site plan. 
c.  Revisions to a binding site plan are permitted so long as any revisions are made through the site plan review process and are consistent with the regulations in effect at the time of application for revisions. If a binding site plan expires or is vacated, the parcel boundaries shall return to the original configuration. Vacation of a binding site plan shall require the signatures of all current owners of the parcels involved. 
B.  If a site plan review is part of an overall application that is subject to a higher approval authority, site plan review shall be considered in conjunction with the overall application by that higher review authority. 
(Ord. No. 1276, 8-3-2013; Ord. No. 1378, § 92, 11-21-2016)
