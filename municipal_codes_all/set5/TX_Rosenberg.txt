PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Rosenberg, Texas of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1990 Code, as supplemented through September 5, 2000, as amended and renumbered by the city and supplied to the publisher, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The user is directed to the Comparative Table of Contents located at the back of the volume for a detailed description of the renumbering. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the city Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This republication was completed under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice President for Production, Anne Wilson, Editor, Electronic Publishing, of the Municipal Code Corporation, and credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff who provided assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Lyn Adolphus, City Secretary and Linda Cernosek, Assistant City Secretary and the other members of the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Upon the introduction of such an ordinance in the city council it may be passed on the first reading, and thereafter shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Rosenberg one time, and shall not thereafter be finally acted upon until at least thirty days have elapsed after the publication thereof. Any citizen of the City of Rosenberg, or resident or owner of land within the territory to be annexed shall have the right to contest said annexation by filing with the city council a written petition setting out his reasons for said contest and after such citizen, resident or owner of land within the territory shall have been given an opportunity to be heard, said ordinance, in original or amended form, as said city council in its judgment may determine, shall be finally acted upon and any territory so annexed shall be a part of the City of Rosenberg. 
(f)  Annexation by any other method provided by law. Additional territory may also be annexed to the city in any manner and by any procedure that may now be provided by law or that may be hereafter provided by law. Same shall be in addition to the methods hereinabove provided.

Sec. 12.01. - Control over and powers with reference to city property. 
(a)  The ownership, right of control and use of streets, highways, alleys, parks, public places and all other real property of the City of Rosenberg is hereby declared to be inalienable to said city, except by ordinances passed by vote of the majority of the governing body of the city, as hereinafter provided; and no franchise or easement involving the right to use same, either along, across, over or under the same shall ever be valid, unless expressly granted and exercised in compliance with the terms hereof, and of the ordinances granting the same. No act or omission of the city, its governing body, officers or agents shall be construed to confer or extend by estoppel or indirection, any right, franchise or easement not expressly granted by ordinance. 
(b)  The City of Rosenberg shall have the power, subject to the terms and provisions hereof, by ordinance, to confer upon any person or corporation, the franchise or right to use the property of the city, as defined in the preceding paragraph, for the purpose of furnishing to the public any general public service, including heat, natural or manufactured gas, electricity, light, power, telephone service, refrigeration, steam and manufacture and distribution of ice, and the carriage of passengers or freight within the said city and its suburbs, over the streets, highways and property of said city, or for any other purposes whereby a general service is to be furnished to the public for compensation or hire, to be paid to the franchise holder, whereby a right to, in part, appropriate or use the streets, highways or other property of the city is necessary or proper; and generally to fix and regulate the rates, tolls and charges of all public utilities of every kind operating within the corporate limits of the City of Rosenberg; provided that no franchise shall be granted by said city to any person, firm or corporation to own, control or operate a sewerage system or waterworks therein. 
Sec. 12.02. - Limitations. 
    No exclusive franchise or privilege shall ever be granted, nor a franchise, nor a privilege to commence at any time after six months subsequent to the taking effect of the ordinance granting the same; and no franchise shall be directly or indirectly extended beyond the term originally fixed by the ordinance granting the same, except as provided by the terms of this Charter; nor, except as hereinafter provided, shall any franchise be granted to any person, firm or corporation, their associates, assigns or successors, to acquire the physical property, rights or franchise of another person, firm or corporation to whom or to which a franchise has already been granted by the city, whereby the rights and properties held and used under such franchise are assigned to any other person, firm or corporation which holds a franchise from the city extending beyond the time of the expiration of the franchise of the person, firm or corporation selling such physical properties, rights or franchises; provided, however, that when it shall appear that the public welfare will be promoted by permitting or requiring the properties of two or more companies doing the same character of business to be under one common ownership the city may, in granting a franchise for such properties, allow or require the ownership of such properties to become vested in one ownership or one corporation, provided that no debts or obligations of any said companies so consolidated shall be assumed by the corporation, person or association of persons acquiring the ownership of such properties except such debts and obligations of said companies, or either of them, as could at the time of the creation of such indebtedness lawfully be created under the constitution and laws of the State of Texas, and only to the extent that the assumption of such indebtedness is permitted under the provisions of the ordinance granting such franchise and the amount of such indebtedness shall be fixed or limited in such ordinance, and the same shall not thereafter be increased except by such actual moneys as may hereafter be expended pursuant to the rules and regulations to be formulated by the city council from time to time. 
Sec. 12.03. - Procedure for passing franchise ordinances. 
    The City of Rosenberg shall have the power by ordinance to grant any franchise or right mentioned in the preceding sections hereof, which ordinance shall not be passed finally until its third and final reading, said ordinances shall be read at three separate regular meetings of the city council of the City of Rosenberg, the last of which shall take place not less than thirty days from the first. No ordinance granting a franchise shall pass any reading except by a vote of the majority of the city council, and such ordinance shall not take effect until sixty days after its adoption on its third and final reading; provided, however, that if at any time before such ordinance shall finally take effect, a petition shall be presented to the city council signed by not less than twenty percent of the voters voting at the last regular municipal election but in no event less than one hundred fifty of the bona fide qualified voters of the city, then the city council shall submit the question of the granting of said franchise to a vote of the qualified voters of the City of Rosenberg at the next succeeding regular municipal election to be held in said city; provided that notice thereof shall be published over a period of at least twenty-one days in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Rosenberg, prior to the holding of said election. Ballots shall be used, briefly describing the franchise to be voted on and the terms thereof and containing the words, "For the granting of a franchise," and, "Against the granting of a franchise." The votes shall be canvassed by the city council, and should it result in a majority of those voting thereon casting their votes "For the granting of a franchise," then by order entered in its minutes, the city council shall so declare and said franchise shall at once take effect. But should a majority of such votes be cast "Against the granting of a franchise," as ascertained by the city council, then said city council by order entered in its minutes shall so declare and such franchise shall not take effect. In case a franchise is refused by the city council, then the matter may be submitted to the qualified voters on petition, as hereinbefore provided, and a failure to finally pass on an application within twelve months after the filing of such application, shall be construed as a refusal. The city council in passing an ordinance granting a franchise may provide therein that it shall not take effect until the same shall have been submitted to and approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting thereon at a regular municipal election. All expenses of publication shall be borne by the applicant for the franchise, who shall make a deposit in advance to cover the estimated cost of publication, to be determined by the city manager.

No other franchise holder, or any person, firm of [or] corporation acting directly or indirectly for such franchise holder, shall be granted such franchise and such grant in violation of this prohibition shall be absolutely void to the extent of the excess in time beyond the life of such main franchise. No franchise privilege or easement shall ever be used or operated so as to extend or enlarge any other franchise or privilege granted by said city except upon surrender of such original franchise as herein provided, and any violation of this prohibition shall operate as a forfeiture of each and all such franchise privileges or easements. No holder of a franchise heretofore or hereafter granted shall have a right (unless such right is granted in the franchise) to transfer or assign its properties and franchise to any other person, firm or corporation without the consent of the city, and such consent, when given, shall not operate as the granting of a franchise or as a new franchise. 
(b)  The city council shall have the power to compel all persons, firms or corporations operating any public utilities in this city, whether operating under existing franchise, or franchises that may be hereafter granted, to extend their services, lines, pipes, or other facilities, if the person to be benefited by such extension will pay the costs thereof, or if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city council that the revenue resulting from such extension will, within a reasonable time after same is made, pay a reasonable return on the investment, after making the customary allowances for depreciation. 
(c)  All public utility franchises in the City of Rosenberg shall be held, whether expressed in the ordinance or not, subject to the right of the city (each of the following being a condition): 
(1)  To repeal the same by ordinance at any time for failure to begin construction or operation within the time prescribed or otherwise to comply with the terms of the franchise, such power to be exercised only after due notice and hearing. 
(2)  To require an adequate extension of plant and service, and the maintenance of the plant and fixtures at the highest reasonable standard of efficiency. 
(3)  To establish reasonable standards of service and quality of products to prevent unjust discrimination in service or rates. 
(4)  To prescribe the form of accounts kept by each such utility, provided, that if the utility shall keep its accounts in accordance with the uniform system of accounts for said utility prescribed by the National Association of Railroad and Public Utility Commissioners, or the Federal Power Commission, or the Federal Communications Commission, or the Railroad Commission of Texas, their successor, or successors, this shall be deemed sufficient compliance with this paragraph. 
(5)  At any time to examine and audit the accounts and other records of any such utility and to require sworn annual and other sworn reports, including reports on local operations by each such public utility. 
(6)  To impose such reasonable regulations and restrictions as may be deemed desirable or conducive to the safety, welfare and accommodation of the public. 
(7)  To fix and regulate the price and rates for the service to be performed under the franchise. 
(8)  To require such compensation and rental as may be permitted by the laws of the State of Texas. 
(d)  Every public utility franchise hereafter granted shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Charter, whether such terms and conditions are specifically mentioned in the franchise or not. 
Sec. 12.05. - Consent of property owners. 
    The consent of abutting and adjacent property owners shall not be required for the construction, extension, maintenance or operation of any public utility; but, nothing in this Charter or in any franchise granted thereunder shall ever be construed to deprive any such property owner of any right of action for damage or injury to his property as now or hereafter provided by law. 
Sec. 12.06. - Extensions. 
    All extensions of public utilities within the city limits shall become a part of the aggregate property of the public utility, and shall be operated as such, and shall be subject to all the obligations and reserved rights contained in this Charter and in any original grant hereafter made. The right to use and maintain any extension shall terminate with the original grant and shall be terminable as provided in this Charter. In case of an extension of a public utility operated under a franchise hereafter granted, such right shall be terminable at the same time and under the same conditions as the original grant. 
Sec. 12.07. - Other conditions. 
    All franchises heretofore granted are recognized as contracts between the City of Rosenberg and the grantee, and the contractual right as contained in any such franchises shall not be impaired by the provisions of this Charter, except that the power of the City of Rosenberg to exercise the right of eminent domain in the acquisition of any utility property is in all things reserved, and except the general power of the city heretofore existing and herein provided for to regulate the rates and services of a grantee which shall include the right to require proper and adequate extension of plant and service and the maintenance of the plant and fixtures at the highest reasonable standard of efficiency. Every public utility franchise hereinafter granted shall be held subject to all the terms and conditions contained in the various sections of this article whether or not such terms are specifically mentioned in the franchise. Nothing in this Charter shall operate to limit in any way, as specifically stated, the discretion of the council or the voters of the city in imposing terms and conditions as may be reasonable in connection with any franchise grant. 
Sec. 12.08. - Utility rates and charges. 
    The city council shall have the power by ordinance to fix and regulate the price of water, gas, electric lights, electric power and steam heat, and to regulate and fix the fares, tolls and charges of local telephone service, and charges of all public buses, carriages, hacks, and vehicles of every kind, whether transporting passengers, freight or baggage, and generally to fix and regulate the rates, tolls and charges of all public utilities of every kind operating within the corporate limits of the City of Rosenberg. 
Sec. 12.09. - Applicable to streets and highways. 
(a)  The right to use the public streets, highways, alleys and thoroughfares of this city, which necessitates the digging up, or displacement thereof, for the installation of equipment, appliances or appurtenances, either on, above or below the surface of same, to make the intended use thereof practicable, shall be deemed and considered a franchise, granting of which shall be governed and controlled in the manner herein provided. 
(b)  The use of the said public streets, highways, alleys and thoroughfares of this city, which does not require the digging up or similar interference with said streets, alleys or highways for the installation of equipment, appliances or appurtenances, to make the intended use possible, shall be treated and considered as a privilege, subject to the control and disposition of the city council, and such privilege over and upon the said public streets, alleys, highways and thoroughfares of the city shall not be granted to any person or corporation excepting when public necessity and convenience may require such use and when given by ordinance by a majority vote of the entire city council. 
(c)  All franchises and privileges for the use and occupancy of public streets, highways, alleys and thoroughfares of this city shall be subject to cancellation by the city council for breach of any terms and conditions thereof; and the city reserves the right to require all public utilities holding franchises from the City of Rosenberg to conform to street grades, and alter their structures to meet changing conditions. 
(d)  The city's exclusive power of dominion, control and jurisdiction in, upon, over and under the public streets, avenues, alleys and highways of the city shall also include, but not be limited to, the right to regulate, locate, re-locate, remove, or prohibit the location of all utility pipes, lines, wires or other property.

The ordinance providing for the submission of such amendment or amendments shall require the submission thereof at an election to be held not less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days after the passage of said ordinance. If the next regular municipal election is to be held during said period; the submission of said amendment or amendments shall be at such election.

(Ord. of 8-3-65) 
Editor's note- An ordinance adopted August 3, 1965, approved at a special election held October 5, 1965, amended § 13.17 to permit the council to submit amendments upon its own motion and to provide for notice by advertising, previously mailed by the city secretary to each qualified voter, and to change the time limits within which such election shall be held from not less than 60 nor more than 100 to not less than 30 nor more than 90. 
Sec. 13.18. - Submission of the Charter to electors. 
(a)  The Charter Commission in preparing this Charter finds and decides that it is impracticable to segregate each subject so as to permit a vote of "yes" or "no" on the same, for the reason that the Charter is so constructed that in order to enable it to work and function it is necessary that it should be adopted in its entirety. For these reasons the Charter Commission directs that the said Charter be voted upon as a whole and that it shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the City of Rosenberg at an election to be held for that purpose on the 20th day of November, A. D., 1956. If a majority of the qualified voters voting in such election shall vote in favor of the adoption of this Charter, it shall become the Charter of the City of Rosenberg and after the returns have been canvassed, the same shall be declared adopted. 
(b)  An official copy of the Charter shall be filed with the records of the city, and the mayor shall as soon as practicable certify to the secretary of state an authenticated copy under the seal of the city, showing the approval by the qualified voters of such Charter. 
(c)  In not less than thirty days prior to such election the city council shall cause the city secretary to mail a copy of this Charter to each qualified voter of the City of Rosenberg as appears from the tax collector's roll for the year ending January thirty-first preceding said election. 
Sec. 13.19. - Interim municipal government. 
(a)  From and after the date of the adoption of this Charter the persons then filling the elective offices of the city will continue to fill those offices for the term to which they were elected, to-wit: the mayor serving at the time of the adoption of this Charter shall serve as mayor of the City of Rosenberg under this Charter for the duration of the term to which he was elected or until his successor shall have been elected and qualified. The city commissioners filling said offices on the city council from and after the first election hereinafter provided for shall continue as councilmen filling positions one and two as may be determined by lot, and conforming with section 5.04 of this Charter, and shall continue to fill such positions for the duration of the term to which they were respectively elected or until their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified. 
(b)  Within thirty days after the adoption of this Charter, the city council shall call an election for the filling of positions three, four, five and six as defined and identified in the aforesaid section 5.04, which councilmen shall be elected for a term to expire on the first Monday in May, 1958, or until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. The city council as then constituted shall be the governing body of the City of Rosenberg under the terms of this Charter. Thereafter the city council shall be elected every two years as provided in sections 5.04 and 5.05 of this Charter. 
(c)  Thereafter, elected officials of the City of Rosenberg shall formally assume their offices at the first council meeting in June following their election, except in case of special elections. 
(Ord. No. 87-54, § 4, 8-10-87) 
    We, the duly constituted members of the Charter Commission of the City of Rosenberg, do hereby certify that the foregoing publication constitutes a true copy of the proposed charter of the City of Rosenberg as adopted and recommended by said committee.

HISTORICAL 
    A Charter Committee [2] was appointed by the Mayor and City Commissioners of Rosenberg in the manner set forth by Article 1168 of the Revised Statutes of the State of Texas. This committee was composed of forty-two prominent business and professional men, who gave freely of their time and effort in the interest of our city and whose names appear at the end of this Charter. 
    A Charter Committee held regular meetings for several months, making a careful study of the Charters of other cities and the needs and requirements of our City. The Charter now submitted represents the best collective and deliberate efforts to draft for the City of Rosenberg a workable, efficient and modern Charter, vesting in the qualified voters the exercise of home rule powers and creating a council-manager form of government. 
    The original draft of this proposed Charter was submitted to the Department of Municipal Engineering of the A. & M. College of Texas, and the Administrative Staff of the League of Texas Municipalities. Comments and suggestions were carefully considered and the proposed Charter is, for the greater part, the selection of those provisions appearing in other Charters under which the people of other Texas cities have more successfully operated their city governments and municipal affairs. It is our belief that this proposed Charter will, now in the years to come, provide a sound and economical government for Rosenberg, and the Charter Committee respectfully submits it to the present governing body and recommends the adoption by the voters.

(Code 1960, § 1-6) 
Sec. 1-13. - General penalty; continuing violations; abatement. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code, or any other ordinance of the city, an act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of an act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful and no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any such ordinance shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), except for:

(e)  There shall be no requirement that each amendment to the Code state a penalty; and, in the case of an amendment to the Code for which a penalty is not stated, the general penalty provided in subsection (a) above shall apply to such amended section of the Code; or in case an amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in this chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein. 
(f)  The imposition of a penalty under the provisions of this Code shall not prevent the revocation or suspension of any license, franchise or permit issued or granted under the provisions of this Code nor shall it be deemed to prevent, impede or delay the rights of the city to proceed in any court of competent jurisdiction to secure equitable relief, including, but not limited to, injunctions, or to file suits in the name of the city or as a member of a class for damages or other relief as provided by law. 
(g)  Any person or corporation who permits, aids, assists, or employs another person or corporation in doing any prohibited act or failing to do any act as shall be required in this Code shall be deemed in violation of the chapter and section prohibiting or requiring such act as if such person or corporation had actually committed such act or failed to actually perform such act as herein required. Such person or corporate representative need not actually be present at the time of the violation; and a person or corporation may be deemed in violation of such chapter and section whenever the act of permitting, aiding, assisting, or employing occurs before or after the violation. 
(h)  In addition to the penalties hereinabove provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the city as provided by law. Each day that such condition continues to exist shall be regarded as a new and separate offense. 
(i)  Regarding other remedies applicable to a violation, the City of Rosenberg hereby declares that it shall have available to it all remedies, rights and relief as shall be from time to time provided for and permitted under the laws of the United States of America and the State of Texas or other political subdivision of which said city is a part for the enforcement of laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and provisions of this Code.

In the event such a surviving spouse shall die before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section, the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be paid to the estate of such spouse. 
(4)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system and who performed service for this city prior to September 1, 1987, (for which service that employee did not receive credit with the system because the employee was not at that time a member of the system due to his/her age at the date of his/her employment) is hereby granted service credit with the system for all of such service (performed after the date of his/her latest employment by the city) that is prior to September 1, 1987, for which the employee has not previously received credit with the system, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Government Code § 852.105. 
(5)  The rights, credit and benefits hereinabove authorized shall be in addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force at the effective date of this section pursuant to the TMRS Act.

(1)  All parties shall have the right to representation by a licensed attorney though an attorney is not required; 
(2)  Each party may present witnesses in his own behalf;

(4)  If the hearing officer finds that on the date of the hearing the conditions which were set out in the notice as grounds of denial, suspension or revocation of the permit do not exist, he shall order such permit issued or reinstated. 
    A copy of the findings and order of the hearing officer shall be served on the permittee, or if the address of the permittee is unknown or the notice has been sent certified mail, return receipt requested and has been returned undelivered, such notice shall be served on the person in charge of the establishment or on any employee or agent of the permittee. 
(f)  Correction of conditions; inspection; reinstatement of license. Whenever the reason for a suspension no longer exists, the permittee or person in charge of the establishment shall notify the city that the conditions under which the permit was suspended have been corrected and that an inspection is requested. Such inspection shall be conducted as soon as possible after receiving the request and in no event shall be later than three (3) regular working days after the receipt of the request for an inspection.

(i)  Nonrefundable permit fee; reinstatement of permit. In the event a permit is revoked, the city shall not be liable to the permittee for any refund of any part of the permit fee. Reinstatement of a permit that has been revoked shall require application and payment of a permit fee as if it were an initial application; provided, however, no permit shall be issued to the same permittee if the permittee has been convicted of any offense involving cruelty to animals; no permit shall be issued to the same permittee within one (1) year of the date a permit has been revoked; and no permit shall be issued for the same location unless it is shown that adequate precautions have been taken so that the conditions under which the permit was revoked shall not reoccur. If there is a dispute between the inspector and a person applying for a permit for a place for which a permit was revoked as to whether adequate precautions have been taken so that the conditions under which the permit was revoked will not reoccur, the applicant may request a hearing before the hearing officer. Such hearing shall be conducted under the same procedures as a hearing for a suspension or revocation of a permit, however the burden shall be on the applicant to show that adequate precautions have been taken so that the conditions under which the permit was revoked will not reoccur.

(c)  Seizure of noise producing property. The chief of police or his duly authorized agents is hereby authorized to apply to any magistrate for an administrative search warrant for the purpose of entering private property to investigate and identify noise nuisance producing devices, machines, instruments or objects. Such identified property may be seized to summarily abate the noise nuisance if: 
(1)  A person who is cited for the subject noise violation has been convicted of a violation of any provision of this article within the preceding twelve (12) months, or has been declared to be a "habitual noise nuisance violator" within the preceding twenty-four (24) months; or 
(2)  The location of the noise nuisance has been declared a habitual noise nuisance source by the chief of police, after appropriate notice to the real property owner or person in possession of the subject noise-source real property, of an administrative hearing to be held for the purpose of hearing evidence and determining whether the subject location is in fact a "habitual noise nuisance source." Upon finding a location to be a "habitual noise source," the noise producing property shall be immediately seized at the time of any subsequent violations whether or not there is a previous noise nuisance conviction associated with the location. 
    Such seizures shall be for the purpose of assuring continued cessation of the noise nuisance by securing the instrumentality of the noise nuisance temporarily. The noise producing device, machine, instrument, or object shall be returned to the owner or person proving the right of possession, or to his/her authorized agent, not sooner than twenty-four (24) hours after seizure. Any disputed ownership or right of possession shall be resolved at a property disposition hearing before the magistrate of the city. Seizure of noise nuisance producing property shall be accomplished in addition to and not in lieu of municipal court prosecution and/or a civil suit for injunctive relief and civil penalties. 
(d)  Impoundment of noise nuisance animals. Upon the determination by the chief of police that any animal(s) at an identified address or location within the city has produced noise on two (2) occasions of a nature and intensity that violates the standards established by this article, he may notify the resident or occupant that the animal(s) is producing a noise nuisance, and that an administrative hearing shall be held for the purpose of determining if the animal(s) constitutes a continuing noise nuisance which must be summarily abated by seizure and impoundment until the owner or person from whom the animal was seized provides written consent of another person to provide shelter and care for the animal(s) in a fenced property not less than two hundred (200) feet from any neighboring residential structure, or until the tenth day of impoundment. Said animals shall be destroyed if not reclaimed on or before the ten (10) days of impoundment. 
(e)  Declaration of habitual noise nuisance producer. After producing noise measured at decibels in excess of the maximum allowed by this article on three (3) separate days within a twelve-month period, the noise producer shall be given notice of an administrative hearing before a municipal court magistrate for the purpose of introducing evidence so that the magistrate can make a determination of whether or not the cited noise producer is a "habitual noise nuisance producer," and if the magistrate so finds, a written declaration of said finding shall be signed by the magistrate and kept on file by the chief of police for a period of one (1) year. 
(f)  Declaration of habitual noise nuisance location. After the production of noise in excess of that allowed by this article by anyone at the same address or property location on three (3) separate days within a twelve-month period, the owner or lessee or person in possession shall be given notice of an administrative hearing before a municipal court magistrate for the purpose of introducing evidence so that the magistrate can make a determination of whether or not the location is a "habitual noise nuisance source," and if the magistrate so finds, a written declaration of said finding shall be signed by the magistrate and shall be kept on file by the chief of police for a period of one (1) year. 
(g)  Seizure. If the magistrate determines that the noise producer is a "habitual noise nuisance producer" or that the location is a "habitual noise nuisance source," the noise producing instrument, equipment, or other noise producing item used by the habitual noise nuisance producer may be immediately seized at the time of a subsequent decibel measurement in excess of that allowed by this article. At the time of such seizure, a written notice of the right to an immediate administrative hearing before a municipal court magistrate shall be issued to the habitual noise producer or owner or person in possession of the habitual noise nuisance source. The hearing shall be for the purpose of determining if a noise nuisance actually occurred on which the seizure was based, and to voice any complaints about the manner of the seizure. If the noise produced is determined by the magistrate not to constitute a noise nuisance, the subject property shall be immediately delivered over to the person from whom it was seized.

The owner shall have ten (10) days following receipt of the paint materials to abate the visual blight. 
(b)  In addition to the relief authorized in subsection (a) above, if the owner demonstrates that none of the family members residing in a homestead that is the subject of a visual blight notice is able to apply the paint because of age, physical disabilities, dependent care obligations or other limitations beyond their reasonable control, then the director of planning and engineering shall cause the visual blight to be abated without cost to the owner, and no lien shall be placed on the homestead property.

(a)  Cable operators may identify as a separate line item of each regular subscriber bill the following: 
(1)  The amount of the total bill assessed as a franchise fee. 
(2)  The amount of the total bill assessed to satisfy any requirements imposed on the cable operator by the franchise agreement to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels. 
(3)  The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber. In order for a governmental fee or assessment to be separately identified under this section, it must be directly imposed by a governmental body on a transaction between a subscriber and an operator. 
(b)  The charge identified on the subscriber bill as the total charge for cable service should include all fees and costs itemized pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 5, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-361. - Basic service tier rates. 
(a)  Generally. Basic service tier rates are subject to regulation by the city in order to assure that they are in compliance with the requirements of 47 USC § 543. Rates that are demonstrated, in accordance with this division, not to exceed the initial permitted per channel charge or the subsequent permitted per channel charge, as described below, or the equipment charges as specified in section 16-362, will be accepted as in compliance. The maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier offered by a cable operator shall consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. The maximum monthly charges for the basic service tier shall not include any charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and installations are to be calculated separately pursuant to section 16-362. 
(b)  Initial permitted per channel charge. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, the initial date of regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier and that Ordinance No. 93-23, from which this division is derived, has been adopted by the city. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, rates in effect on the initial date of regulation or in effect on September 30, 1992, shall be the rates charged to subscribers for service received on that respective date. 
(3)  The permitted per channel charge on the initial date of regulation shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either a charge determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding; or the charge specified in subsection (b)(3) a, b, or c of this section, as applicable: 
a.  If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is equal to or below the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the date of initial regulation, then the permitted per channel charge shall be the per channel charge in effect on the date of initial regulation, adjusted for equipment. 
b.  If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation, and the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was above the benchmark per channel charge, then the permitted per channel charge is nine-tenths ( 9/10 ) of the per channel charge in effect on September 30, 1992, but no lower than the benchmark per channel charge, additionally adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tiers. 
c.  If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation, and the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was below the benchmark per channel charge, then the permitted per channel charge is the benchmark rate per channel adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tier. 
(c)  Subsequent permitted per channel charge. After the initial date of regulation, the permitted channel charge for the basic service tier shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
(1)  A per channel rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing; or 
(2)  The prior permitted per channel charge previously approved by the city, adjusted for inflation and external costs in accordance with the price cap requirements set forth in subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  Price cap requirements. 
(1)  Inflation adjustments. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may be adjusted periodically on account of inflation. Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of inflation shall be based on changes in the Gross National Product Price Index (GNP-PI) published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce. 
(2)  External costs. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may also be adjusted for changes in external costs measured on a per channel per subscriber basis. To the extent external cost increases are greater or less than the GNP-PI for the relevant period, the per channel charge will be adjusted accordingly. Per channel charges may not be increased if external costs other than franchise fees increase at a rate less than inflation. Permitted per channel charges also shall be decreased on account of external costs to the extent such costs decrease from previous levels. 
a.  Categories. External costs shall consist of costs in the following categories: 
1.  State and local taxes applicable to provision of cable television service; 
2.  Franchise fees; 
3.  Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including costs of providing public, educational, and governmental access channels as required by the city; 
4.  Retransmission consent fees; and 
5.  Programming costs. 
b.  The permitted per channel charge for the basic service tier shall be adjusted on account of programming costs and retransmission consent fees only for programming or broadcast signals offered on that tier. 
c.  The permitted per channel charge shall not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or charges in those fees incurred prior to October 6, 1994. 
d.  The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs for the basic service tier shall be the initial date of regulation or one hundred eighty (180) days from September 1, 1993, if the initial date of regulation occurs on or after one hundred eighty (180) days from September 1, 1993. 
e.  Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to permitted per channel charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as part of the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier. 
f.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming obtained from affiliated programmers shall be the lesser of actual increases or the previous permitted rate level increased by the amount of inflation. 
g.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues received by the operator from the programmer. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 6, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-362. - Rates for equipment and installation used to receive basic service tier. 
(a)  Scope of section. The equipment regulated under this section consists of all equipment in a subscriber's location that is used to receive the basic service tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive other tiers of regulated programming service and/or unregulated service. Such equipment shall include, but is not limited to: 
(1)  Converter boxes; 
(2)  Remote control units; 
(3)  Connections for additional television receivers; and 
(4)  Other cable home wiring. 
    Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section. 
(b)  Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation, and additional connections separate from rates for the basic service tier. In addition, the rates for such equipment and installations shall be unbundled one (1) from the other. 
(c)  Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an equipment basket, which will include all costs associated with providing customer equipment and installation under this section. Equipment basket costs shall be limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of providing, leasing, installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment, as determined in accordance with the cost accounting and cost allocation requirements of section 16-363. The equipment basket shall not include general administrative overhead including general marketing expenses. The equipment basket may include a reasonable profit. 
(d)  Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges for equipment and installation using the hourly service charge (HSC) methodology. The HSC shall equal the operator's annual equipment basket costs, excluding the purchase cost of customer equipment, divided by the total person hours involved in installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment during the same period. The purchase cost of customer equipment shall include the cable operator's invoice price plus all other costs incurred with respect to the equipment until the time it is provided to the customer. The HSC is calculated according to the following formula: 
HSC = EB - CE / H 
Where 
EB = annual equipment basket cost; 
CE = annual purchase cost of all customer equipment; and 
H = person hours involved in installing and repairing equipment per year. 
(e)  Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either: 
(1)  The HSC multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual installation; or 
(2)  The HSC multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type of installation. 
(f)  Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control unit shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of the type of remote leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales tax, financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the customer, added to the product of the HSC times the average number of hours annually repairing or servicing a remote, divided by twelve (12) to determine the monthly lease rate for a remote according to the following formula: 
Monthly Charge = UCE + (HSC X HR) / 12 
Where: 
HR = average hours repair per year; and 
UCE = average annual unit cost of remote. 
    Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of remote control unit. 
(g)  Other equipment charges. The monthly charges for rental of converter boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as for remote control units. Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of converter box and each significantly different type of other customer equipment. 
(h)  Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges associated with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at rate levels determined by the actual cost methodology presented in subsections (e), (f), and (g) of this section. An operator may recover additional programming costs and the costs of signal boosters on the customer's premises, if any, associated with the additional connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional connections. 
(i)  Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover the operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with storing and preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold to the customer, plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service contracts for the maintenance and repair of equipment sold to subscribers. The charge for a service contract shall be the HSC times the estimated average number of hours for maintenance and repair over the life of the equipment. 
(j)  Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation at charges below those determined under subsections (e) through (g) of this section, as long as those offerings are reasonable in scope in relation to the operator's overall offerings in the equipment basket and not unreasonably discriminatory. Operators may not recover the cost of a promotional offering by increasing charges for other equipment basket elements or by increasing programming service rates above the maximum monthly charge per subscriber prescribed by this division. As part of a general cost-of-service showing, an operator may include the cost of promotions in its general system overhead costs. 
(k)  Franchise fees. Equipment charges may include a properly allocated portion of franchise fees paid to the city. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 7, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-363. - Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements. 
(a)  Applicability of section. The requirements of this section are applicable for purposes of rate adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-of-service showings. 
(b)  Generally accepted accounting principles. Cable operators shall maintain their accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except as otherwise directed by the city. 
(c)  Accounts required. Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application of the city's cost assignment and allocation procedures, to cost categories necessary for rate adjustments due to changes in external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed and supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting records. 
(d)  Accounting level. Except to the extent indicated in subsection (e) of this section, cable operators shall aggregate expenses and revenues at either the franchise, system, regional, or company level in a manner consistent with practices of the operator as of April 3, 1992. However, in all events, cable operators shall identify at the franchise level their costs of franchise requirements, franchise fees, local taxes, and local programming. 
(e)  Cost allocation requirements. 
(1)  For purposes of establishing expenses at the franchise level, cable operators shall allocate expenses and revenues aggregated at higher levels to the franchise level based on the ratio of the total number of subscribers served at the franchise level to the total number of subscribers served at the higher level. 
(2)  Except to the extent indicated in subsections (e)(3) and (4) of this section, all categories of costs allocated to, or identified at, the franchise level shall be allocated to the basic service tier based on the ratio of channels in the basic tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area, including nonregulated and leased commercial access channels. These costs shall be allocated to each tier of cable programming services based on the ratio of channels in that tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area. 
(3)  Costs of programming and retransmission consent fees, however, shall be allocated only to the tier on which the programming or broadcast signal at issue is offered. 
(4)  Costs of franchise fees shall be allocated among equipment and installations, program service tiers and subscribers in a manner that is most consistent with the methodology of assessment of franchise fees by the city. 
(5)  Costs of public, educational, and governmental access channels carried on the basic tier shall be directly assigned to the basic tier where possible. 
(f)  Common costs. Expenses which cannot be assigned to any single expense or service category shall be described as common costs. Common costs shall be allocated to expense categories as follows: 
(1)  Wherever possible, common costs are to be allocated to service cost categories based on direct analysis of the origin of the costs themselves. 
(2)  When direct analysis is not possible, common costs shall, if possible, be allocated to service cost categories based on an indirect, cost-causative linkage to other costs directly assigned or allocated to the service cost category. 
(3)  When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation can be found, common costs shall be allocated to each service cost category based on the ratio of all costs directly assigned and attributed to a service cost category over total costs directly assignable and attributable. 
(g)  Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude from cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of basic service tier and equipment any direct or indirect expenses and revenues not related to the provision of such services. Common costs of providing basic service tier and equipment and unrelated activities shall be allocated between them in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. 
(h)  Part-time channels. In situations where a single channel is divided on a part-time basis and is used to deliver service associated with different tiers or with pay per channel or pay per view service, a reasonable and documented allocation of that channel between services shall be required along with the associated revenues and costs. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 8, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-364. - Costs of franchise requirements. 
(a)  The costs of satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels shall consist of the sum of: 
(1)  All per channel costs for the number of channels used to meet franchise requirements for public, educational, and governmental channels; 
(2)  Any direct costs of meeting such franchise requirements; and 
(3)  A reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(b)  The costs of satisfying any other requirement under the franchise shall consist of the direct and indirect costs, including a reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 9, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-365. - Charges for customer changes. 
(a)  This section shall govern charges for any changes in service tiers or equipment provided to the subscriber that are initiated at the request of a subscriber after the initial service installation. 
(b)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods shall be a nominal amount, not exceeding actual costs, as defined in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers or equipment that involve more than coded entry on a computer or other similarly simple method shall be based on actual cost. The actual cost charge shall be either the HSC, as defined in section 16-361, multiplied by the number of person hours needed to implement the change, or the HSC multiplied by the average number of person hours involved in implementing customer changes. 
(d)  A cable operator may establish a higher charge for changes effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods, subject to approval by the city, for a subscriber changing service tiers more than two (2) times in a twelve-month period, except for such changes ordered in response to a change in price or channel line-up. If a cable system adopts such an increased charge, the cable system must notify all subscribers in writing that they may be subject to such a charge for changing service tiers more than the specified number of times in any twelve-month period. 
(e)  Downgrade charges that are the same as or lower than upgrade charges are evidence of the reasonableness of such downgrade charges. 
(f)  For thirty (30) days after notice of retiering or rate increases, a customer may obtain changes in service tiers at no additional charge. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 10, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-366. - Notification of proposed rate increase. 
(a)  A cable operator shall provide written notice to a subscriber of any increase in the price to be charged for the basic service tier or associated equipment at least thirty (30) days before any proposed increase is effective. The notice shall include a provision stating that protests to such prices may be filed with the city at the City Attorney's Office, P.O. Box 32, Rosenberg, Texas 77471. The notice shall also include a statement that such protests must be filed with the city no later than thirty (30) days after the notice is received by the subscriber. 
(b)  In addition to the notice required in subsection (a) of this section, the cable operator shall give the city a minimum of thirty (30) days' advance written notification of any changes in rates for cable programming service or associated equipment. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 11, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-367. - Initiation of review of basic cable service and equipment rates. 
    A cable operator shall file its schedule of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment with the city within thirty (30) days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier, or by November 15, 1993, whichever is later. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 12, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-368. - City review of basic cable rates and equipment costs. 
(a)  After a cable operator has submitted to the city for review its existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment costs or a proposed increase in these rates (including increases in the baseline channel charge that results from reductions in the number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed rates will become effective after thirty (30) days from the date of submission to the city. However, the city may toll this thirty-day deadline for an additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in subsection (d) of this section within thirty (30) days of the rate submission explaining that it needs additional time to review the rates. The city may, at any time, require the cable operator to produce additional information, including proprietary information, that the city deems necessary in order to make a rate determination. If proprietary information is provided, the provisions of section 16-369 will apply to such information. 
(b)  Upon receipt by the city, the cable operator's submittal shall be available for public inspection and copying. Comments on the submittal by interested persons may be submitted in writing or orally at a city council meeting held at any time during the initial thirty-day review period. Written comments shall be addressed to the City Attorney's Office, P.O. Box 32, Rosenberg, Texas 77471, and must be received prior to the end of the thirty-day review period. 
(c)  If a cable operator submits a proposed rate increase for review that appears to exceed the presumptively reasonable level and does not include a cost-of-service showing to justify the rate, the city will permit the cable operator to cure this deficiency and submit a cost-of-service showing. 
(d)  If the city is unable to determine, based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the existing or proposed rates are within the permitted basic service tier charge or actual cost of equipment, as defined in sections 16-361 and 16-362, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to sections 16-363 and 16-370, seeking to justify a rate above the basic service tier charge, as defined in sections 16-361 and 16-362, the city may toll the thirty-day deadline in subsection (a) of this section to request and/or consider additional information or to consider the comments from interested parties as follows: 
(1)  For an additional ninety (90) days in cases not involving cost-of-service showings; or 
(2)  For an additional one hundred fifty (150) days in cases involving cost-of-service showings. 
    The order tolling the effective date of the proposed rate shall explain why the city could not make the necessary determination, and it shall also provide the cable operator an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in its original filing. During the additional time periods provided in this subsection, comments from interested persons may be submitted in writing, as provided in subsection (b) of this section, or orally during at least one (1) city council meeting during the period of abatement. 
(e)  If the city has availed itself of the additional ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150) days permitted in subsection (c) of this section, and has taken no action within these additional time periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at the end of the ninety- or one-hundred-fifty-day periods, or existing rates will remain in effect at such times, subject to refunds if the city subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates. However, in order to order refunds, the city must have issued a brief written order to the cable operator by the end of the ninety- or one-hundred-fifty-day period permitted in subsection (c) of this section directing the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 13, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-369. - Proprietary information. 
(a)  If the city has required the cable operator to produce proprietary information under the provisions of this division, the cable operator may submit therewith a request that such information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any materials to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(b)  Each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from inspection and of the facts upon which those reasons are based. If the request is that the materials be withheld from inspection for a limited period of time, that period shall be specified. 
(c)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a request in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the city will not grant routine public access to the materials. A letter to that effect will be placed in a public file in lieu of the materials withheld from public inspection. 
(e)  However, if a written request for the materials is received by the city pursuant to the Open Records Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code § 552.001 et seq., the city will notify the person providing the materials of the request for the materials. If the person providing the materials requests the city to do so, the city will request an opinion from the attorney general, pursuant to the Open Records Act, regarding the public availability of the materials. If the person providing the materials does not request the city to request an opinion from the attorney general, the city may, at its option, either request such an opinion or provide the materials to the public. 
(f)  If the attorney general issues an opinion or letter ruling requiring the city to make the materials available to the public, the materials will be made available for public inspection. 
(g)  If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the city assumes no obligation to consider the need for nondisclosure. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 14, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-370. - Burden of proof. 
(a)  A cable operator has the burden of proving that its existing or proposed rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with 47 USC § 543, and sections 16-361 and 16-362. 
(b)  For an existing or a proposed rate for basic service tier or associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual cost of equipment as set forth in sections 16-361 and 16-362, the cable operator must submit the appropriate FCC form to the city. 
(c)  For an existing or a proposed rate for basic service tier that exceeds the permitted tier charge as set forth in sections 16-361 and 16-362, the cable operator must submit to the city a cost-of-service showing to justify the proposed rates. The cost-of-service showing must be in conformance with accounting and cost allocation requirements as adopted and amended by the commission for cable system operators. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 15, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-371. - Small systems. 
(a)  A small system, as defined in section 16-357, may certify that the small system's initial rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with section 16-361. A certification by a small system under this section shall be filed with the city within thirty (30) days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier. The certification shall be in writing, shall be signed by the general manager of the system, and shall be verified. 
(b)  Such certification shall be subject to verification by the city on its own motion or upon complaint by a subscriber. The city may request additional information from the operator in order to verify the certification. If proprietary information is requested by the city, the provisions of section 16-369 shall control the availability of such information to the public. 
(c)  As used in this section, initial rates shall mean those rates charged by the small system operator on the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier and that Ordinance No. 93-23, from which this division is derived, has been adopted by the city. 
(d)  If the city determines that the small system's certification is in error, it shall so notify the small system operator and shall require the small system to comply with all filing requirements in this division for systems that are not small. 
(e)  Subsequent rate filings by a small system operator shall comply in all respects with the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 16, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-372. - Written decision. 
(a)  The city shall issue a written decision in a ratemaking proceeding whenever it disapproves an initial rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment in whole or in part, disapproves a request for a rate increase in whole or in part, or approves a request for an increase in whole or in part over the objections of interested parties. The city is not required to issue a written decision that approves an unopposed existing or proposed rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment. 
(b)  Public notice shall be given of any written decision required in subsection (a) of this section, by making the text of any written decision available to the public, and by publication of the decision one (1) time in the official newspaper of the city. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 17, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-373. - Reduction of rates; prescription of rates. 
(a)  The city may order a cable operator to implement a prospective reduction in basic service tier or associated equipment rates where necessary to bring rates into compliance with the standards set forth in sections 16-361 and 16-362. 
(b)  The city may prescribe a reasonable rate for the basic service tier or associated equipment after it determines that a proposed rate is unreasonable. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 18, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-374. - Refunds. 
(a)  The city may order a cable operator to refund to subscribers that portion of previously paid rates determined by the city to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the rate charged as reasonable. Before ordering a cable operator to refund previously paid rates to subscribers, the city shall give the operator notice and opportunity to comment. The operator's opportunity to comment upon the proposed refunds may be at any meeting of the city council during the city's period of review of the operator's rates. If the city has extended its review period under section 16-368, and has issued an accounting order under subsection 16-368(e), then the operator, prior to refunds being ordered, may request an opportunity to appear before the city council to comment upon the proposed refunds. 
(b)  An operator's liability for refunds is limited to a one-year period, except that an operator who fails to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city shall be liable for refunds commencing from the effective date of such order until such time as he complies with such order. 
(c)  The refund period shall run as follows: 
(1)  From the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction back in time to September 1, 1993, or one (1) year, whichever is shorter; 
(2)  From the date the city issues an accounting order pursuant to subsection 16-368(d), and ending on the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction ordered by the city or one (1) year, whichever is shorter. 
(d)  The cable operator, in its discretion, may implement a refund in the following manner: 
(1)  By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid the overcharges, either through direct payment or as a specifically identified credit to those subscribers' bills; or 
(2)  By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment to cover the cumulative overcharge. This shall be reflected as a specifically identified, one-time credit on prospective bills to the class of subscribers that currently subscribe to the cable system. 
(e)  Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments. 
(Ord. No. 93-23, § 19, 9-19-94) 
Sec. 16-375. - Severability. 
    If any section, sentence or clause of this division is for any reason held to be illegal, ultra vires or unconstitutional, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this division.

Upon hearing such application, the city council may authorize the city secretary to issue a permit for drilling, operation and maintenance of a well; provided, however, the city council shall not be required to approve a permit when the city council finds and determines that such approval is not in the best interests of the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the city. No decision by the city council to disapprove an application for a permit shall at any time be subject to appeal or review before any other authority, it being the intention of the city council to be the body having exclusive control over permits and the issuance thereof. 
(c)  The city council shall have the power and reserves the authority to refuse any application for a permit where, by reason of the location of the proposed well and the character and value of the permanent improvements in its vicinity, and the use to which the land and surroundings are adapted for civic or other purposes, or for other reasons the city council considers, such proposed well, based upon the facts and circumstances of the application and all relevant facts relating thereto, is likely to result in a hazard to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(d)  When a permit shall have been issued, the same shall terminate and become inoperative without any action on the part of the city council unless within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance the actual drilling of a well or wells has been commenced; and after drilling of a well has commenced, the cessation for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days of drilling operations, or the cessation of production of oil and gas from the well after production shall have commenced, shall operate to terminate and cancel the permit and the well shall be considered as abandoned for the purposes of this article. It shall be unlawful thereafter to continue the operation or drilling of such well without the issuance of another permit.

The order issued by the oil and gas inspector shall be final and valid as of the date of issuance and the hearing as herein provided shall occur within the period as herein provided. 
(b)  The city manager shall determine if proper cause exists, and if not, shall order the permitted activity to resume without delay. If the city manager determines that proper cause does exist for order to cease activity, then the city manager shall make whatever ruling is proper to assure rectification of the cause of any peril. Such ruling and compliance with the permit by the permittee shall not be construed to absolve the permittee of any liability for any violation of this chapter or for any damage caused as a result thereof. 
(c)  The city manager may designate a hearing officer to conduct such hearings. 
(d)  Any person aggrieved by any order of the city manager may request a hearing before the city council, and the city council shall proceed as hereinafter provided.

In addition, no authority granted under this Code shall be deemed to have any final authority until an application for a tower permit has finally been approved by the city manager of the City of Rosenberg or his/her designee. 
Sec. 27-11. - General requirements for approval of an antenna tower or structure and the issuance of a tower permit. 
    The following general provisions shall govern the issuance of a tower permit and shall control all applications for a tower permit. Each applicant requesting a tower permit under this Code shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, or other documentation signed and sealed by appropriate professional engineers showing the location and dimensions of the improvement, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information necessary to assess compliance with this Code, as well as such other and additional information as may be deemed necessary and required by the City Council of the City of Rosenberg. 
Sec. 27-12. - Availability of suitable towers or other structures. 
    No new tower permit shall be issued unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city council that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna or tower may consist of the following: 
(1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineer's requirements. 
(2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineer's requirements. 
(3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
(4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers, or structures or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antennas. 
(5)  The fees or costs required to share an existing antenna or structure, which will be paid at the beginning of a sharing relationship or will be paid within one (1) year from the date of the inception of any sharing relationship, exceed the cost of constructing a new tower. 
(6)  Property owner(s) of existing towers or structures are unwilling to accommodate reasonably the applicant's needs. The applicant must specify the reason for property owner(s) refusing to accommodate and submit satisfactory proof of non-accommodation including documents evidencing appropriate financial tenders. 
(7)  The applicants demonstrate that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
Sec. 27-13. - Setbacks. 
    The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a tower permit is required; provided, however, that the governing body may, in its discretion, provide for other or different regulations if it finds that the goals of this Code are better served by such modifications. 
(1)  Towers must be set back a distance equal to one thousand (1,000) feet from the nearest point to any lot platted for residential use or any structure in residential use. If the height of the antenna tower is deemed to be greater than five hundred (500) feet, then the setback as herein provided shall be three (3) times the height of the tower. 
(2)  Towers, guys and accessory facilities must be constructed in a way to avoid adverse impact upon adjoining properties and the uses thereof. In addition, all such structures and apparatus must be properly screened by a visual barrier or fence of a height not less than eight (8) feet and shall be appropriately marked. 
(3)  For areas which are separated from lots platted for residential use or from structures in residential use by more than one thousand (1,000) feet, towers over ninety (90) feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter (1/4) mile from an existing tower that is over ninety (90) feet in height. 
Sec. 27-14. - Variances. 
(a)  The City Council of the City of Rosenberg shall consider the following factors in determining whether or not to grant a variance from these regulations and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate and necessary in order to determine that the goals of this Code are properly served: 
(1)  Height of the proposed tower; 
(2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential districts; however, the city council will not approve any tower which is closer than one thousand (1,000) feet to any lot platted for residential use or from any structure in residential use unless good cause is shown to exist, in which case a variance may be granted; 
(3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
(4)  Surrounding topography; 
(5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
(6)  Design of the tower with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obstructiveness; and 
(7)  The availability of suitable and existing towers and other structures presently constructed which are suitable for antenna location. 
(b)  A variance may, at the sole discretion of the city council, be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified period of time. All conditions imposed by the city council are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this Code. 
Sec. 27-15. - Security. 
    The base of the tower shall be fenced with materials impervious to sight and secured so that it is not accessible by the general public. No signs, other than warning or equipment signs shall be located on a tower. 
Sec. 27-16. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. 
    Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be deemed abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove the same within thirty (30) days of the receipt of a notice from the city council notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within the required thirty (30) days, or such additional period as may be allowed by the city council upon application, the city council may remove such antenna or tower at the expense of the owner and may file a lien upon the real estate and any personal property or fixtures found to pay the cost of removal. 
Sec. 27-17. - Antennas and towers existing as of the date of the adoption of this chapter. 
(a)  Any antenna or tower that would otherwise be subject to regulation under the terms and provisions of this Code that had been constructed and lawfully in existence at the date of adoption of this chapter shall be deemed grandfathered and shall not be subject to the regulations provided under this Code for the issuance of a tower permit. However, all other provisions of this Code applicable to the maintenance, replacement or renovation of an antenna or tower shall be deemed applicable and in existence. 
(b)  The owner of a previously existing antenna tower shall be entitled to grandfathered status only if the owner and/or lessee of the antenna or tower shall file a declaration and claim of grandfathered status on or before the expiration of six (6) months from the date of adoption of this chapter. Any person failing to timely claim grandfathered status shall be required as a condition of the maintenance of an antenna or tower to obtain a tower permit as herein required for a newly constructed antenna or tower. 
Sec. 27-18. - Applicant shall acquire no vested rights. 
(a)  No applicant for a tower permit or person intending to apply for a tower permit shall at any time acquire any vested rights to a tower permit or other authority or privilege to maintain an antenna or tower in the city limits of the City of Rosenberg, nor shall any person who shall have previously constructed and maintained an antenna or tower otherwise subject to regulation under this chapter be deemed to have acquired any vested rights or property rights to maintain such tower or antenna in the City of Rosenberg. 
(b)  The City of Rosenberg declares that the provisions of this chapter are necessary for the preservation of the health, safety and well-being of the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the City of Rosenberg and as such the health, safety and well-being of the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the City of Rosenberg require that this chapter and Code be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law and that all rights of property shall at all times be subordinate to the regulations as herein set out. 
Sec. 27-19. - Regulations to the extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
    The city council finds and determines that its regulation of antennas and towers are important for the maintenance of the health, safety and well-being of the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the City of Rosenberg and, as such, declares that the regulations contained in this chapter and Code shall, to the extent that may from time to time be permitted under the laws of the State of Texas, be applicable to all towers and antennas that may be permitted and constructed in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Rosenberg.

    Any person discharging waste from any property or premises into the sanitary sewers of the city who has a private source of water supply or who receives his water supply from a source other than the city may choose to install a water meter of the type and standard approved by the utility department for the purpose of measuring the amount of water taken into such facilities. Such meter shall be installed in a location approved by the utility department and accessible to the water meter readers of the city at all times during the hours from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week of each year. The water consumption indicated by such meter shall be the basis of determining the sewer charge provided for in this division. 
(Code 1960, § 27-76; Ord. No. 2008-34, § 1, 9-16-08) 
Sec. 29-140. - Engineering study to determine charge for commercial users where portion of water not discharged into sewer. 
(a)  The provisions of this section shall apply only to those commercial water users who have facilities connected to the sanitary sewers of the city and who make application to the director of utilities under the provisions hereof. 
(b)  Any commercial water user owning or having control of property discharging waste into the sanitary sewers of the city and on whose property there is located one (1) or more facilities requiring water (from the source of supply that also furnished water to the sanitary disposal facilities) and all or part of such water provided to any such facility is not discharged into the sanitary sewers of the city may make application to the director of utilities, on forms furnished by the director, requesting that an engineering study of the applicant's property and facilities be made for the hereinafter stated purpose and paying the deposit herein provided. 
(c)  Applications made under the provisions of this section shall be upon forms promulgated and furnished by the director of utilities, and the applicant shall furnish all the information and other matters requested therein. The fee for making application under the provisions hereof shall be two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). In addition, the costs for preparation of the engineering study shall be paid in full by the applicant upon completion thereof pursuant to subsection (d). No fee shall be required for studies initiated by the director of utilities subsequent to the first application. Each applicant shall agree, as a condition precedent to the director conducting the study and tests provided for herein, including those initiated by the director to indemnify and hold harmless the city of and from any and all such liability for any act or omission by the city, its agents and employees committed while conducting the engineering studies and tests provided for herein, causing or resulting in damages to the property or person of the applicant, his agents, employees and invitees. 
(d)  Upon receipt of an application and the fee required herein, the director of utilities will make a reasonable estimate of the costs to make an engineering study of the applicant's property and facilities and shall require the applicant to deposit such amount against the costs before proceeding with the study. Such deposit will be applied to the actual costs upon completion of the study and any amounts remaining will be refunded to the applicant. If a balance remains after application of the deposit, the applicant shall pay such balance before the sewer service charge is computed based on the study and report. In those instances where, in the opinion of the director based upon an engineering study of the property and facilities of the applicant, it is impractical or unfeasible for the applicant to install one (1) or more meters to measure the amount of water passing through the water meter serving such property and not being discharged into the sanitary sewers of the city, the director is authorized to make an engineering study to determine the percentage of the amount of water passing through such meter that is being discharged into the sanitary sewers of the city. A report of such determination, showing the basis thereof, shall be certified to by the director, and one (1) copy shall be filed with the city secretary and one (1) copy shall be retained by the director. Such report, when so filed, shall constitute the basis upon which the sewer service charge established by this article shall be computed. 
(e)  The director of utilities is authorized, at his discretion or on written request from an applicant, to make such additional engineering studies from time to time of any such property and facilities to check the current accuracy of the filed report on any such property, and if it is determined that the filed report is more than five (5) percent inaccurate, a new report based upon the latest studies shall be filed with the city secretary to replace the prior one. A complete copy of each such report shall be retained by the utility department for billing purposes. No change in the basis of computing the sewer service charge for any property will be made until the first billing date after the filing by the director with the city secretary of the first or any subsequent report. Requests by an applicant for a restudy under the provisions hereof will not be accepted or acted on more often than once in every twelve-month period (annually) subsequent to the filing of the first report on the applicant's property, except when a substantial or material change in a condition or operation of the applicant's property or facilities renders the then-current filed report and the charges based thereon no longer applicable to the applicant's property and facilities. 
(f)  In the event it is necessary that certain testing instruments be installed or that existing equipment or facilities located on the applicant's property be altered, adjusted, disconnected or temporarily moved in order to facilitate the making of an engineering study or test under the provisions of this section, all of the foregoing shall be done by and at the expense of the applicant. 
(g)  When the director of utilities, as a result of an engineering study made under the provisions of this section, has determined the percentage of metered water passing through the water meters serving a property that is being discharged into the sanitary sewers of the city, or when the amount of metered water passing through the water meter serving such property and which is not being discharged into the city's sanitary sewers is determined from a water meter installed to measure the amount of such water billings by the city for sanitary sewer service to such property made prior to such determination shall be reviewed for the purpose of making whatever adjustment is necessary in order to charge such customer only for that amount of metered water that is or has been discharged into the city's sanitary sewers. No adjustment shall be made in excess of that determined to be proper from such engineering study or from the metering of water that is not discharged into the sanitary sewers of the city. Once the proper percentage of adjustment has been determined and certified to the city secretary under the provisions of this section, all subsequent adjustment of water usage for sanitary sewer service charge purposes shall be computed only on the certified basis of adjustment currently on file with the city secretary. 
(Code 1960, § 27-78; Ord. No. 90-02, § 15, 2-20-90; Ord. No. 2008-34, § 1, 9-16-08) 
Sec. 29-141. - Determination of charge where user maintains more than one source of water supply. 
(a)  Where a sewer system user maintains more than one (1) source of water supply, and only one (1) source produces sewage flow discharging into the sanitary sewer system of the city, the sewer service charge shall be determined by metering only that source of water supply. Failure of the owner or operator to install the necessary approved meter will constitute an agreement and consent by such owner or operator that the city's estimate of the total water usage, irrespective of actual discharge, will be the basis upon which the sewer charge will be based. 
(b)  The city's estimate of water usage may be made by whatever means and calculations the director of utilities determines to be fair and equitable, and which will reasonably reflect the approximate water usage of such premises. 
(Code 1960, § 27-79; Ord. No. 2008-34, § 1, 9-16-08) 
Sec. 29-142. - Responsibility for charge where city does not supply water for all multiple living unit connections. 
    Where the city does not supply the source of water for all multiple living unit connections, the owner of the premises will be held responsible for the sewer service charge, where individual water meters are not provided for each living unit. 
(Code 1960, § 27-80) 
Sec. 29-143. - Deductions not to be made for vacancies in apartments or duplex residences; removal of apartment or duplex unit from service. 
No  deductions will be made for vacancies in the application of the minimum sewer service charge to apartments or duplex residences in any classification. An apartment unit or duplex unit removed from such service by remodeling or abandonment will be relieved of payment of a sewer service charge, but correction of the city's records must be requested by the owner in writing or by signing the proper forms provided by the city. 
(Code 1960, § 27-81) 
Sec. 29-144. - Billing. 
(a)  Billing for sewer service charges shall be made to the water customers of the city concurrently with the monthly water bills issued by the city to such customers. Those persons without water meters or with a source of water supply other than the city will be billed on those same dates. 
(b)  All sewer user bills shall be due and payable in accordance with section 29-49. 
(Code 1960, § 27-82; Ord. No. 90-02, § 16, 2-20-90) 
Sec. 29-145. - Adjustment of bill. 
    In the event any adjustment in a water bill affects the basis on which the city sewer charge is levied for the same period, an appropriate adjustment in the sewer charge shall be made. 
(Code 1960, § 27-83) 
Sec. 29-146. - Discontinuance of service for failure to pay. 
    The city shall have the right to discontinue either or both water and sanitary sewer service in accordance with section 29-46. 
(Code 1960, § 27-84; Ord. No. 90-02, § 17, 2-20-90) 
Sec. 29-147. - Continued use of sewer after refusal to pay. 
    Any person failing or refusing to pay the charges provided for in this article, or failing to appeal a disconnection upon receipt of the notice of termination in the event of a dispute as to the amount of such charges, in the time and manner provided, and who continues to discharge waste from his property into the sanitary sewer systems of the city, shall be guilty of an offense and shall be punished in the manner provided for in section 29-115. Each and every day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such. The conviction of a person for such an offense shall not be a bar to the institution by the city of a suit for the collection of the delinquent charges and for an injunction to enjoin such person from discharging waste into the sanitary sewer systems of the city without complying with the provisions of this division and paying the charges established hereby.

Additions to the service area may be designated by the city council consistent with the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08; Ord. No. 2014-01, § 2(A), 1-21-14 ) 
Sec. 29-268. - Land use assumptions. 
    Land use assumptions used in the development of the impact fees are contained in Exhibit B of this article. These assumptions may be revised by the city council according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08; Ord. No. 2014-01, § 2(B), 1-21-14 ) 
Sec. 29-269. - Service units. 
(a)  Service units are established in accordance with generally accepted engineering and planning standards. 
(b)  Service units shall be calculated based on living units equivalent as determined by the size of the water meter(s) for the development; or alternatively, as approved by the city as a result of an engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering services in the State of Texas, which demonstrates that the number of LUEs of service for the new development will be different than those indicated by the size of the water meter. 
(c)  If the city determines that the water pressure in the city's transmission main is significantly higher or lower than standard pressure such that the size of the water meter is not indicative of actual service demand, the city may adjust the number of LUEs based on a smaller or larger sized meter which more accurately reflects the flow rate and the system pressure conditions. 
(d)  If a fire demand meter (tap) is purchased for a property, the meter size utilized to calculate the number of LUEs shall be the dimension of the portion of the fire demand meter which reflects the meter size which would provide only domestic service to the property. Said reduced meter size shall then be utilized to calculate the number of LUEs. 
(1)  The meter types used to calculate the number of LUEs shall be either simple or compound meters. 
(2)  If the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the then-owner of the property shall be assessed the then-current fee for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity. 
(3)  To avoid the use of fire flow volumes for domestic usage, the owner of any property for which a fire demand meter is purchased shall be required to execute a restrictive covenant on a form approved by the city, which covenant shall acknowledge the right of the city to assess such fees to subsequent owners of the property. Said covenant shall be executed prior to the purchase of the fire demand meter and shall be filed in the deed records of the county. 
(4)  No fees shall be collected for the purchase of taps which shall be utilized to provide only fire protection capacity. 
(e)  If a landscape irrigation meter (tap) is purchased exclusively to provide water for an irrigation system, the number of LUEs shall be considered zero and no fees shall be collected. 
(1)  If at any point in time, the meter is utilized for domestic purposes, which includes residential, commercial or industrial purposes, as evidenced by physical connections to the water meter piping or irrigation system piping; or as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the then-owner of the water meter account and/or private property owner utilizing said meter shall be assessed the then-current impact fee based on the meter size installed, regardless if any of the meter capacity is still utilized to provide water to an irrigation system. 
(f)  If a water meter or sewer tap is purchased exclusively to provide water or sanitary sewer service for a single-family residential home in existence prior to January 1, 2008, for the purpose of converting from a private water well or septic system, the number of LUEs shall be considered zero and no fees shall be collected. 
(1)  If at any point in time, the water meter or sewer connection is utilized for a purpose, which includes commercial or industrial purposes, as evidenced by physical connections to the water meter or sewer piping; or as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the then-owner of the water meter or sewer connection account and/or private property owner utilizing said water meter or sewer connection shall be assessed the then-current impact fee based on the meter size installed, regardless if any of the meter capacity is still utilized to provide water to an existing single-family residence home in existence prior to January 1, 2008. 
(g)  Upon wastewater tap purchase for lots for which no water meter has been purchased, service units shall be established by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Texas, shall be reviewed by the city and shall be presented to the city council, which shall designate the appropriate number of service units. 
(h)  The city council may revise the service unit designation according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08; Ord. No. 2011-12, § 2, 7-19-11; Ord. No. 2014-03, § 2, 1-21-14 ; Ord. No. 2018-38, § 4, 9-18-18 ) 
Sec. 29-270. - Impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  The maximum impact fee per service unit for each service area shall be computed by dividing the growth-related capital construction cost of service in the service area identified in the capital improvements plan for that category of capital improvements, by the total number of projected service units anticipated within the service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development, based on the land use assumptions for that service area, and adjusted by subtracting credits in the form of future rate or tax contributions to water and/or wastewater CIP funding. Maximum impact fees per service unit for each service area are established by category of capital improvements and are set forth in Exhibit C to this article. 
(b)  Exhibit C may be amended by the city council according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors. 
(c)  The impact fees imposed per service unit shall be effective impact fees set forth in Exhibit C, which may be amended from time to time by the city council through ordinance amendment to any amount less than the maximum impact fee per service unit as set forth in Exhibit C to this article. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08; Ord. No. 2014-01, § 2(C), 1-21-14 ) 
Sec. 29-271. - Assessment of impact fees. 
(a)  The approval of any subdivision of land or of any new development shall include as a condition the assessment of the impact fee applicable to such development. 
(b)  Assessment of the impact fee for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations following the effective date of this article, assessment shall be at the time of final subdivision plat approval, and shall be the value of the effective impact fee per service unit then in effect, as provided in Exhibit C as set forth in section 29-270(c). The city may provide the subdivider with a copy of Exhibit C prior to final subdivision plat approval, but such shall not constitute assessment within the meaning of this article. 
(2)  For new development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this article and for which no replatting is necessary prior to the issuance of a building permit, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit, and shall be the value of the effective impact fee per service unit set forth in Exhibit C. 
(3)  For new development which occurs or is proposed to occur without platting, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit, and shall be the value of the effective impact fee per service unit set forth in Exhibit C. 
(4)  Fees shall not be assessed to property which has previously purchased taps for the property and which desires to exchange those purchased taps for taps which will reflect an equivalent number of LUE's, as determined under section 29-269. If the exchange of said taps will result in an increase in the number of LUE's, the purchaser shall be assessed the effective impact fee in effect at the time of tap exchange, based on the additional LUE's required. 
(5)  Because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole, water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to collection of an impact fee. However, if the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the current owner of the property shall be assessed the effective impact fees currently in effect at the time such conversion is established by the city for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity. 
(c)  Following assessment of the impact fee pursuant to subsection (b), no additional impact fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases, as set forth under section 29-269. 
(d)  Following the lapse or expiration of approval for a plat, a new assessment must be performed at the time a new application for such development is filed. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08) 
Sec. 29-272. - Calculation of impact fees. 
(a)  Following the request for new development as provided in section 29-271 of this article, the city shall compute impact fees due for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The total service units for the new development shall be multiplied by the appropriate per-unit effective impact fee value determined as set forth in sections 29-270 and 29-271; and 
(2)  Fee offsets shall be subtracted as determined by the process proscribed in section 29-275 of this article. 
(b)  The value of each impact fee due for a new development shall not exceed a value computed by multiplying the effective impact fee assessed per service unit pursuant to sections 29-270 and 29-271 by the number of service units generated by the development. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08) 
Sec. 29-273. - Collection of impact fees. 
(a)  No water or wastewater tap or building permit shall be issued until all impact fees have been paid to the city, or until a "notice of impact fee due" is recorded as provided in this section, except as provided otherwise by contract. 
(b)  Impact fees shall be paid at the time of issuance of a building permit, except as provided in subsection (c) through subsection (g). 
(c)  For land platted outside the corporate boundaries of the city, fees shall be collected at the time an application for connection to the city's water or wastewater system is filed by the property owner or someone on behalf of the property owner. 
(d)  If the city lacks authority to issue building permits in the area where the impact fee applies, impact fees shall be collected at the time an application is filed for connection to the city's water or wastewater system by the property owner or someone on behalf of the property owner. 
(e)  For new development converting to the city water utility from an individual water well, or to the city wastewater utility from a septic tank or individual waste disposal system, the city may allow the feepayer to pay impact fees in the form of a monthly assessment, as provided below: 
(1)  At the request of the applicant, and with the approval of the city manager, the impact fees for such customers may be paid in increments over a period of not more than five (5) years, with interest computed on the unpaid balance at the statutory rate as set forth in Section 302.002 of the Texas Finance Code, or any successor statute. 
(2)  If the applicant chooses this extended payment option, the applicant shall, as a condition of tap sale and/or building permit issuance, sign and file with the city clerk, and consent to the recordation of, a "notice of impact fee due", which shall be recorded as a lien against the subject property. The city shall release the lien held only upon payment in full of the impact fees and any late penalties and applicable interest. 
(3)  Late payments shall subject the applicant to a penalty of ten (10) percent of the monthly amount due and additional interest to all other remedies available to the city as lien holder. 
(f)  For new development limited only to single family residential homes located on lots or non-platted land with a width of less than fifty (50) feet, and not located within the boundaries of a municipal utility district (MUD) or created by the terms or conditions of a development agreement, the city shall allow the fee payer to pay impact fees in the form of a monthly assessment, as provided below: 
(1)  At the request of the applicant, and upon verification by the city manager that all qualifying criteria are met, the impact fees for such customers shall be paid in increments over a period of not more than eight (8) years, with interest computed on the unpaid balance at the rate of one (1) percent. 
(2)  If the applicant chooses this extended payment option, the applicant shall, as a condition of tap sale and/or building permit issuance, sign and file with the city clerk, and consent to the recordation of, a "notice of impact fee due", which shall be recorded as a lien against the subject property. Said "notice of impact fee due", shall state the property use is limited to single family residential until such date the lien is released by the city. The city shall release the lien held only upon payment in full of the impact fees and any late penalties and applicable interest. 
(3)  Late payments shall subject the applicant to a penalty of ten (10) percent of the monthly amount due and additional interest in addition to all remedies available to the city as lien holder. 
(g)  The city may, at its sole discretion, enter into contracts to establish a different date of fee collection than those provided in this section. 
(h)  It shall be the policy of the city to attempt to revise any contracts which might exist with wholesale customers, or which in the future may be entered into for wholesale service, in such a manner that impact fees are collected from the wholesale customer according to the number of LUE's attributable to each retail meter for new development within the wholesale customer's service area. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08; Ord. No. 2012-21, §§ 2, 3, 7-17-12) 
Sec. 29-274. - Suspension of fee collection. 
(a)  For any new development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this article in accordance with Texas Local Government Code, Chapter 212, or pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations and utility policies, or for which an application for final plat approval has been made prior to the effective date of this article, the city may assess, but shall not collect any impact fee as herein defined, on any service unit for which a valid building permit is issued within one (1) year subsequent to the effective date of this article. 
(b)  If the building permit, which is obtained within the period specified in subsection (a), subsequently expires, and no new application is made and approved within such period, the new development shall be subject to the payment of an impact fee, as provided in Section 29-273. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08) 
Sec. 29-275. - Offsets against impact fees. 
(a)  The city shall offset the present value of any system-related facilities, pursuant to rules established in this section, which have been dedicated to the city by the feepayer, and have been received by the city, including the value of rights-of-way or capital improvements constructed pursuant to an agreement with the city, against the value of the impact fee due for that category of capital improvement. 
(b)  All offsets against impact fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this article and additional standards promulgated by the city, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines. 
(1)  No offset shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  The unit costs used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the capital improvements plan for the category of facility within the service area for which the impact fee is imposed. 
(3)  If an offset applicable to a plat has not been exhausted within ten (10) years from the date of the issuance of the first building permit after the effective date of this article or within such period as may be otherwise designated by contract, such offset shall lapse. 
(4)  In no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer for an offset when no impact fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to this article or for any value exceeding the total impact fees due for the development for that category of capital improvement, unless otherwise agreed to by the city. 
(c)  An applicant for new development must apply for an offset against impact fees due for the development either at or before the time of plat recordation. The applicant shall file a petition for offsets with the city on a form provided for such purpose. The contents of the petition shall be established by administrative guidelines. The city must provide the applicant, in writing, with a decision on the offset request, including the reasons for the decision. The decision shall specify the maximum value of the offset which may be applied against an impact fee, which value and the date of the determination shall be associated with the plat for the new development. 
(d)  The available offset associated with the plat shall be applied against an impact fee in the following manner: 
(1)  Such offset shall be prorated equally among all service units, as calculated in Section 29-269, and remain applicable to such service units, to be applied at time of filing and acceptance of an application for a building permit, against impact fees due. 
(2)  If the total number of service units used by the city in the original offset calculation described in subsection (1) is eventually exceeded by the number of total service units realized by the actual development, the city may, at its sole discretion, collect the full impact fee exclusive of any associated offset for the excess service units. 
(3)  At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative offset agreements upon petition by the owner in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08) 
Sec. 29-276. - Establishment of accounts and records. 
(a)  The city shall establish separate interest-bearing accounts, in a bank authorized to receive deposits of city funds, for each major category of capital facility for which an impact fee is imposed pursuant to this article. 
(b)  Interest earned by each account shall be credited to that account and shall be used solely for the purposes specified for funds authorized in section 29-277. 
(c)  The city shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to ensure that impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the purposes authorized in section 29-277. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this article; provided, however, that any fee paid shall be expended within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed ten (10) years from the date the fee is deposited into the account. 
(d)  The city shall maintain and keep adequate financial records for each such account, which shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues, which shall account for all monies received, and which shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from each account shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision of uses specified in the capital improvements program as system-related facilities. The city shall also maintain such records as are necessary to ensure that refunds are appropriately made under the provision in section 29-279 of this article, and such other information as may be necessary for the proper implementation of this article.

Sec. 29-277. - Use of proceeds of impact fee accounts. 
(a)  The impact fees collected pursuant to this article may be used to finance or to recoup capital construction costs of service. Impact fees may also be used to retire bonds or to pay the principal sum and interest and other finance costs on bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance such capital construction costs of service. 
(b)  Impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall not be used to pay for any of the following expenses: 
(1)  Construction, acquisition or expansion of capital improvements or assets other than those identified in the associated capital improvements plans; 
(2)  Repair, operation, or maintenance of existing or new capital improvements or facilities expansions; 
(3)  Upgrading, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements to serve existing development in order to meet stricter safety, efficiency, environmental or regulatory standards;

(1)  The applicability of an impact fee to the development; 
(2)  The basis for fee calculation; 
(3)  The availability or the value of an offset; 
(4)  The application of an offset against an impact fee due; 
(5)  The amount of the refund due, if any. 
(b)  The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the value of the fee or the value of the offset was not calculated according to the applicable impact fee schedule or the guidelines established for determining offsets. 
(c)  If the appeal application is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the city manager in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact fee due, the development application or tap purchase or building permit application may be processed while the appeal is pending. 
(Ord. No. 2008-50, § 2, 12-16-08) 
Sec. 29-279. - Refunds. 
(a)  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to this article which has not been expended within ten (10) years from the date of payment, shall be refunded, upon application, to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid, or, if the impact fee was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in Section 302.002 of the Texas Finance Code, or any successor statute. 
(b)  An impact fee collected pursuant to this article shall be considered expended, using first-in/first-out accounting, assuming that revenues are spent in the order of their collection. Such funds shall also be considered expended, if the total expenditures for capital improvements or facilities expansions authorized in section 29-277 within ten (10) years following the date of payment exceeds the total fees collected for such improvements or expansions during such period. 
(c)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), the city shall pro-rate the same by dividing the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner or governmental entity shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(d)  Upon the request of an owner of the property on which an impact fee has been paid, the city shall refund such fees if: 
(1)  Existing service is available and service is denied; or 
(2)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and the city has failed to commence construction of facilities to provide service within two (2) years of fee payment; or 
(3)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and has not subsequently been made available within a reasonable period of time considering the type of capital improvement or facility expansion to be constructed, but in any event later than five (5) years from the date of fee payment. 
(e)  The city shall refund an appropriate proportion of impact fee payments in the event that a previously purchased unused water meter is replaced with a smaller meter, based on the LUE differential of the two (2) meter sizes and the per-LUE fee at the time of the original fee payment, less an administrative charge of fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(f)  Petition for refunds shall be submitted to the city on a form provided by the city for such purpose. Within one (1) month of the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the city must provide the petitioner, in writing, with a decision on the refund request, including the reasons for the decision. If a refund is due to the petitioner, the city manager shall cause a refund payment be made to the petitioner.

Sec. 29-282. - Agreement for capital improvements. 
    The city council may approve the owner of a new development to construct or finance some of the public improvements identified in the CIP. In the case of such approval, the property owner must enter into an agreement with the city prior to fee collection. The agreement shall be on a form approved by the city, and shall establish the estimated cost of improvement, the schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement, a requirement that the improvement shall be completed to city standards, and any other terms and conditions the city deems necessary. The city manager or his/her designee shall review the improvement plan, verify costs and time schedules, determine if the improvement is contained in the CIP, and determine the amount of the applicable offset for such improvement to be applied to the otherwise applicable impact fee before submitting the proposed agreement to the council for approval.

(a)  Impact fees established by this article are additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the city on the development of land or the issuance of building permits or the sale of water or wastewater taps or the issuance of certificates of occupancy. Such fees are intended to be consistent with and to further the policies of city's comprehensive plan, capital improvements plan, subdivision regulations and other city policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the city seeks to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities in conjunction with the development of land. 
(b)  This article shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density of development, design, and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of public improvements subject to the subdivision regulations or other regulations of the city, which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development. 
(c)  Impact fees established by this article are in substitution of and/or supplemental to, any impact fees imposed by the city for water and wastewater utilities in existence prior to the adoption of this article. If the collection of an impact fee under this article is prohibited by paragraph (a) of section 29-274 hereof, and a water and/or wastewater utility impact fee was lawfully assessed but uncollected by the city prior to adoption of this article, the fee assessed shall be collected upon issuance of a building permit or a water or wastewater tap into the city's system, if such permit or tap is issued within one (1) year after the effective date of this article. Impact fees assessed as provided above and collected after such one-year period shall be in the amount provided by this article. Provided, however, any water and/or wastewater utility impact fee assessed and collected on a lot, tract, or parcel of land prior to adoption of this article, which, under the terms of this article, is required to pay the amount of the impact fees established hereunder, shall be given a credit, in the amount of such fee paid, against the water and wastewater impact fees due under this article.

    No person shall follow in a tow truck any ambulance or police vehicle, which is traveling on a public street while that ambulance or police vehicle is using emergency signals. 
( Ord. No. 2013-12, § 1, 2-19-13 ) 
Sec. 30-81. - Soliciting towing business on a city street prohibited. 
    No tow company shall solicit in any manner, directly or indirectly, a person owning/operating any vehicle which is involved in an incident on a public street. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the solicitation is for the purpose of soliciting the business of towing, repairing, selling, or purchasing such vehicle. 
( Ord. No. 2013-12, § 1, 2-19-13 ) 
Sec. 30-82. - Duties of tow companies. 
    It shall be the obligation of all tow companies under this section to operate the tow business in a safe manner, to include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Taking direction from investigating officer. Upon arrival at the scene of a collision within the city, tow truck operators shall take directions on when to engage or tow from the police officer investigating the collision. 
(2)  Removing debris of collision. Tow truck operators that engage and tow any vehicle from the scene of a collision within the city shall remove all debris of the collision from the public street. This duty specifically includes the removal of vehicle parts, glass, and other debris. Such debris shall be disposed of in a lawful manner, which will keep it out of the gutters, storm sewers, streams, public rights-of-way, or property not belonging to the tow company. 
(3)  Disengaging. A tow truck that removes a vehicle from the original location shall not disengage from the vehicle until the vehicle has been deposited with the appropriate VSF except when the vehicle is released to the owner or operator or when the owner or operator specifies the location of disengagement. This restriction is enacted to prohibit tow trucks from engaging an unauthorized vehicle in a parking facility and moving it to a close location, then returning for another unauthorized vehicle, ultimately towing all the relocated vehicles to a VSF. 
(4)  Drops. A tow truck that has hooked up to a vehicle for towing shall release the vehicle to its owner or operator upon receiving, a drop fee, payment and will not tow the vehicle, except when the vehicle is being taken into custody by a police officer. A vehicle is hooked up if it is immediately ready for transport. A vehicle is not hooked up unless it can be legally towed on a public roadway. 
( Ord. No. 2013-12, § 1, 2-19-13 ) 
Sec. 30-83. - Report of towing of unauthorized vehicle to police dispatcher. 
    The VSF that receives a vehicle from a tow truck that removed the vehicle from private or public property within city and on a non-consent basis, except on police-generated tows, shall notify the police department dispatch office within one (1) hour of receiving the vehicle. The information to be provided in such notification shall include: 
(1)  The general description (brand, model, color) of the vehicle towed, including the state and the license plate, if any; 
(2)  The tow company name that towed the vehicle; 
(3)  The location/address from which the vehicle was towed and reason; 
(4)  The date and time the vehicle was removed from the location; 
(5)  The date and time the vehicle was accepted at the VSF; and 
(6)  The street address and phone number of the VSF where the vehicle is located. 
Such reports shall be made by fax, e-mail or in person. A VSF must release vehicles during the time the VSF accepts vehicles. If the VSF accepts vehicles on a 24-hour-a-day basis, it shall release vehicles on the same basis, with one (1) hour's notice. 
( Ord. No. 2013-12, § 1, 2-19-13 ) 
Sec. 30-84. - Administrative penalties for violations. 
    In addition to the criminal penalties imposed for violations of state law or this article, any tow company on the tow rotation list that violates this article or state law may be subject to sanctions by the chief of police or designee, depending upon the nature of infraction, number of infractions, and other circumstances. The sanctions shall range from written notification of violation with warning to, and including, removal from the tow rotation list. 
( Ord. No. 2013-12, § 1, 2-19-13 ) 
Sec. 30-85. - Appeal of sanctions. 
    An individual who has been issued a sanction may appeal the chief of police's or designee's decision by submitting a written request to the city manager no later than the tenth (10th) day after the effective date of the decision. The individual must include a statement of the grounds for the appeal. The city manager shall schedule a hearing no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after receipt of the notice of appeal. The city manager shall give notice of the time and place set for the hearing to the chief of police and the appellant not less than five (5) days before the hearing. 
( Ord. No. 2013-12, § 1, 2-19-13 ) 
Sec. 30-86. - Appeal procedure. 
(a)  At the appeal hearing, the chief of police and the appellant may present evidence, testimony, and argument. 
(b)  The city manager's decision is final. 
( Ord. No. 2013-12, § 1, 2-19-13 ) 
Sec. 30-87. - Penalty. 
    Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon a conviction shall be subject to a penalty in an amount as provided in section 1-13 of this Code. 
( Ord. No. 2013-12, § 1, 2-19-13 ) 
Sec. 30-88. - Conflict. 
    All ordinances or parts inconsistent or in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such inconsistency or conflict, hereby repealed.

ARTICLE XIV. - ALARM SYSTEMS
Sec. 1-342. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide for the regulation of the use of alarm systems within the city, not inconsistent with the provisions of Texas Revised Civil Statutes Annotated, Article 4413(29bb), in order to minimize the adverse impacts occurring in the community from unmonitored and incorrectly operating alarm systems.
Sec. 1-343. - Duty of owners and operators of alarm systems.
A. The person in control of the property on which an alarm system is installed shall train all persons who may activate the alarm system in the proper operation and deactivation of the alarm system.
B. Any person in control of the property on which an alarm system is installed who is notified by any member of the police or fire department of the activation of an alarm system and who is available to come to the alarm site shall come to the alarm site within thirty (30) minutes of the time such person is notified of such activation and shall provide the police or fire department any necessary access.
C. The city will respond to proper notification of activation of an alarm system without charge, except:
1. The person in control of the property on which an alarm system is installed will be charged the full costs incurred by the city when he, his agent or his employee intentionally or knowingly activated the alarm system for any reason other than an emergency or threat of an emergency of the kind for which the alarm system was designed to give notice. The city council finds that the minimum costs incurred by the city in responding to the activation of an alarm system is one hundred sixty dollars ($160.00). Notwithstanding any tabulation of costs, a minimum charge of one hundred sixty dollars ($160.00) shall be charged the person in control of the property whenever he, his employee or his agent intentionally or knowingly activates an alarm system for any reason other than an emergency or threat of an emergency of the kind for which the alarm system was designed to give notice and the city responded to such activation of the alarm system. Such one hundred sixty-dollar charge shall be a minimum charge only, and shall not be applicable when a tabulation of costs, including overhead, the cost of investigation, and all costs incident to the response to a particular alarm system, shows that the cost was greater than one hundred sixty dollars ($160.00).
2. Unless full costs are chargeable under subsection (C)(1), the amount of the penalty for the signaling of a false alarm shall be:
Page 62
i. No charge, if the location has had five (5) or less false alarms in the preceding twelve-month period;
ii. Seventy-five dollars ($75.00), if the location has had more than five (5) but fewer than eight (8) false alarms in the preceding twelve-month period; or
iii. One hundred dollars ($100.00), if the location has had eight (8) or more false alarms in the preceding twelve-month period.
D. Provided, however, no fee will be charged for a response to notification of the activation of an alarm system if the person in control of the alarm site shows that the activation was not a false alarm and any response by the city to notification of an alarm system will not be included in determining the fees set out above if the person in control of the alarm site shows that such activation was not a false alarm. For purposes of determining the fees set out above, the highest ranking police and/or fire department officer responding to notification of the activation of an alarm system will make the determination as to whether or not such activation was a false alarm as defined herein in the Definitions Chapter of this Code and the burden shall be on the person in control of the alarm site to prove that the activation of the alarm system was not a false alarm.
Sec. 1-344. - Operation of alarm system.
No person shall install, cause to be installed or permit to be installed any alarm system unless the requirements of this section are met.
A. Any alarm system which may be activated as a result of different types of emergency situations shall give a unique signal to designate activation as a result of a holdup, a burglary, a fire or any other type of emergency situation, so that the proper notification and proper response can be made.
B. Any local alarm system, except a fire alarm system, shall have a fifteen-minute shutoff and shall not make a sound similar to that of a siren of an emergency vehicle or a civil defense warning system.
Exception: An alarm system without a fifteen-minute shutoff which is operating on the effective date of this article need not comply with this subsection, until the existing system is replaced.
C. No holdup alarm shall include a money clip, pressure pad or similar device which can cause inadvertent activation; and any holdup alarm shall be designed so that it can be activated only by intentional and deliberate human action.
D. It shall be unlawful for any person to install, cause to be installed or permit the installation within the city of any alarm system equipped with an automatic dialing device unless the same is equipped with a means to automatically disconnect and discontinue the transmittal of said prerecorded message after the same has been
Page 63
communicated to the police department or fire department. For the purposes of this section, an "automatic dialing device" is any device connected to any alarm system which automatically sends a prerecorded message indicating the activation of the alarm system to the police department or fire department.
E. It shall be unlawful for any person to operate, cause to be operated or permit the operation within the city of an alarm system equipped with an automatic dialing device unless the same is equipped with a means to automatically disconnect and discontinue the transmittal of said prerecorded message after the same has been communicated to the police department or fire department. Any prerecorded message shall include a statement as to the nature of the emergency, the resident's name, address and a call-back telephone number.
Exception: A person in control of property upon which an alarm system is operating on the effective date of this article shall not be deemed in violation of this subsection for a period of three (3) months from the effective date of this article.
F. The chief of police may set reasonable standards and procedures to be followed by an alarm system business or telephone answering service when giving notice to the police department of activation of an alarm system.
Sec. 1-345. - Alarm systems monitored by the police department.
A. Existing monitoring panels. All persons or corporations maintaining an alarm monitoring station in the communications office of the police department at the time of adoption of this article may continue to operate alarm systems which will continue to get monitored by the police department.

Sec. 1-418. - Schedule of parking regulations.
A. Calculations. The number of required off-street parking spaces will be calculated according to the formulas set out in this Section.
1. Variables for Calculating Required Parking. The variables used for parking calculations are:
i. Per Square Foot (sf.) of Parking Floor Area (PFA). The phrase "per sf. of PFA" means that the number of parking spaces is calculated based on the number of "parking-related" square feet of floor area put to the use. The PFA is 85 percent of the gross floor area, plus (unless otherwise specified) the area of any parts of the parcel proposed for development that are
Page 90
delineated and used in a manner that is comparable in function and intensity of use to the use of the inside of the building (e.g., outdoor dining areas).
ii. Per Dwelling Unit (DU) or Per Bedroom (BR). The phrase "per '#' DU" means that the number of parking spaces is calculated based on the number of dwelling units. In some cases, the parking requirements are based on the number of bedrooms (per "#" BR unit) in the dwelling units.
iii. Per Bed. The phrase "per bed" means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of beds in the facility instead of the number of sleeping rooms or some other measure. Per bed calculations are normally applied to uses that offer residential care or overnight accommodations with shared rooms.
iv. Per Employee. The phrase per employee means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of employees during the shift in which the maximum number of employees is present.
v. Per Seat Capacity. The phrase per seat means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of seats that are provided for guests (patrons, members, etc.), with benches or pews measured as one seat per each two feet of width.
vi. Per Square Feet (sf.) of Assembly Area. The phrase per sf. Of assembly area means that the number of parking spaces is based on the number of square feet in the largest room used for assembly (e.g. at a school, this is often the gymnasium, but it could also be a theater or lunch room).
vii. Others. Other variables are measured according to their common meanings.
viii.Special Parking Study or Modifications to Required Parking, as set out below in Special Studies.
2. Rounding. If the final calculation of the number of required parking spaces includes a fractional space, the number of required parking spaces is rounded up to the nearest whole number, regardless of the fraction.
3. Multiple Mixed-use or Nonresidential Use. If several mixed-use or nonresidential uses occupy a single parcel or building, the off-street parking and loading requirements shall be the cumulative total for all uses, or as set out in Section 5.103, Alternatives or Modifications to Required Parking, whichever is lesser.
B. Required Parking. The parking spaces required for individual uses are provided in this section delineated by the land use classifications.
Page 91
1. Residential and Commercial Use of the Home. Required off-street parking for residential and commercial uses of the home are set out in Table 1.
2. Institutional, Recreation and Amusement Uses. Required off-street parking for institutional, recreation and amusement uses are set out in Table 2.
3. Commercial Uses. Required off-street parking for commercial uses as set out in Table 3.
4. Agriculture Industrial, Transportation, Utility and Communication Uses. Required off-street parking for agriculture, industrial, transportation, utility and communication uses are set out in Table 4.
C. Required Disabled Parking. As required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, a certain number of required disabled parking spaces are required as part of new development and redevelopment. The disabled parking spaces shall be incorporated into, rather than in addition to, the overall number of parking spaces required by this Section.
D. Uses Not Listed. The Planning Director shall determine the parking requirements for uses that are not listed based on the uses that are most similar to the proposed uses or based on parking studies of similar uses that are provided by the applicant and certified by a qualified transportation planner or professional engineer. The Directors decision may be appealed to the Planning Commission.
E. Special Studies. Some uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics. Accordingly, their parking requirements are listed in the following parking tables as Special Study. Required parking for these uses shall be established by special study according to the standards of this Section. The Special Study shall be prepared as follows:
1. The Special Study shall be completed by a qualified transportation engineer at the applicants expense.
2. The Special Study shall provide:
i. A peak parking analysis of at least three comparable uses.
ii. Documentation regarding the comparability of the referenced uses, including name, function, location, floor area, parking availability, access to transportation network (including vehicular or other if applicable), use restrictions, and other factors that could affect the parking demand.
3. Approval of Special Study.
i. The City Engineer and Planning Administrator may approve the Special Study.
Page 92
ii. The Special Study, if denied, may be appealed to the Planning Commission. The City Engineer and Planning Administrator reserve the right to refer the study to the Planning Commission for review and approval for any reason.
iii. A Special Study may be submitted as the basis for requesting a reduction of parking requirements by demonstration of lesser demand management, subject to:
(a) The City is able to retain a qualified traffic engineer, at the applicants expense, to review the parking demand forecast and provide recommendations to the City;
(b) The comparability of the uses being documented in detail, including their location, gross floor area, street access, use types and restrictions, hours of operation, peak parking demand periods, and all other factors that were considered by the traffic engineer that could affect parking demand; and,
(c) Planning Commission review and approval.

Sec. 1-421.  Shared Parking.
A. Generally. The City Council recognizes that uses may have different hours of operation and peak parking demand hours. The City desires to encourage the sharing of parking for its potential to reduce impervious surfaces and / or enhance the efficiency of land use. Thus, where a mix of uses creates synergy with respect to the utilization of parking spaces due to differences in peak use, the City may reduce the required number of off-street parking spaces according to the provisions of this Section.
B. Shared Parking Table. Shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when a parcel is occupied by two or more uses which typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same time. When any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed below, the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedures:
1. Multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use, excluding spaces reserved for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals (except car share programs), by the appropriate percentage listed in Table 5, Shared Parking Table, for each of the designated time periods.
2. Calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five time periods (columns). The minimum parking requirement is the highest of these sums. Table 6, Illustrative Shared Parking Credit Calculation, provides an example of how to use Table 5, Shared Parking, to calculate required parking.
3. In general, the maximum reduction allowed by Table 5, shall be 25 percent. However, a greater reduction is permitted, provided that:
i. Sufficient land is set aside for each parking space in excess of the 25 percent reduction that is not constructed, so that the spaces may be constructed at a later date should the City Engineer determine that they are necessary; and
Page 98
ii. The property owner executes and records a document that guarantees that the spaces will be constructed upon written order of the City Engineer.
C. Adjoining Property Owners. Property owners on adjoining properties may enter into contractual agreements for shared off-street parking provided that there is enough total parking available to meet the overall parking requirements of both sites.

CHAPTER 2 - FLOOD PREVENTION AND PROTECTION
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL
Sec. 2-1. - Findings of fact.
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Rosenberg, Texas, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
B. Flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
Sec. 2-2. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
Sec. 2-3. - Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter and its several sections use the following methods:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;

Sec. 2-34. - Variance procedures.
A. The planning commission as established by the city shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this Code.
Page 7
B. The planning commission shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or interpretation made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
C. Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
D. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
E. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
F. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 2-33(B) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
G. Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (Article I, Section 2-2).
H. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
I. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
J. Prerequisites for granting variances:
1. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
2. Variances shall only be issued upon, (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Page 8
3. Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
K. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in this Section are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Secs. 2-352-50. - Reserved.
ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
Sec. 2-51. - General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements.
A. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
B. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
C. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
D. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
E. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
F. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and
G. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
Page 9
Sec. 2-52. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) Article I, Section 2-5, (ii) Article II, Section 2-32(H), or (iii) Article III, Section 2-53(C), the following provisions are required:
A. Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Article II, Section 2-33(A)(1), is satisfied.
B. Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined herein. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
C. Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
1. A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade.
3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters.
D. Manufactured homes.
Page 10
1. Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on the city's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
2. Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's FIRM on-sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured housing subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
3. Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on-sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the city's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (D) of this section be elevated so that either:
i. The lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the base flood elevation; or
ii. The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
E. Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on-sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer that one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of Article II, Section 2-33(A), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (D) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
Sec. 2-53. - Standards for subdivision proposals.
A. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with Article I, Section 2-1, Section 2-2 and Section 2-3 of this chapter.
Page 11
B. All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of Article I, Section 2-6, Article II, Section 2-33, and Article III of this chapter.
C. Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Article I, Section 2-5, or Article II, Section 2-32(H) of this chapter.
D. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
E. All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
Sec. 2-54. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article I, Section 2-5, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
A. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the city's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified).
B. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures;
1. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the city's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified); or
2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability or resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads or effects of buoyancy.
Page 12
C. A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Article II, Section 2-33, are satisfied.
D. Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
Sec. 2-55. - Floodways.
Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article I, Section 2-5, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
A. Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If Article III, Section 2-55(A) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article III.
C. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

This exemption is only applicable if the joinder of lots or tracts does not require or necessitate the dedication or removal of any public rights-of-way, public easements or other public improvements, and the owner agrees, in writing and on a form approved by the city, that the merged lot or tract may not be divided in the future unless a subdivision plat authorizing such division has been first approved by the city and filed of record in accordance with applicable state laws and city ordinances governing plats and the subdivision of land. The form must also inform and declare that any subsequent purchaser will be bound by the requirements of this exemption; and
7. A lot or tract of land within the City of Rosenberg that does not have a subdivision plat filed of record or does not otherwise have a valid plat that may be filed of record, which the owner of the lot or tract seeks a building permit, certificate of occupancy, plumbing permit, electrical permit, utility tap, or any other permit or authority required or permitted under this Code, may avoid the necessity of recording a subdivision plat as required by this Code, so long as the permit or other authority or other requirements by the city sought does not require or necessitate the dedication or removal of any public rights-of-way, public easements or other public improvements, and the owner agrees, in writing and on a form approved by the city, that the lot or tract may not be divided in the future unless a subdivision plat authorizing such division has been first approved by the city and filed of record in accordance with applicable state laws and city ordinances governing plats and the subdivision of land. The form must also inform and declare that any subsequent purchaser will be bound by the requirements of this exemption.
B. If platting is not required, the city may, upon proper application and the submission of such information as shall be deemed necessary authorize the issuing of building permits or site plan approval.

Sec. 4-7. - Variances.
A. The commission shall review the variance request and make a recommendation to the city council. The city council may then authorize a variance from these regulations when in its opinion undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. The applicant shall have the responsibility of proving that compliance would create a hardship. In granting a variance, the city council may prescribe conditions that it deems necessary or desirable to the public interest. Any conditions that are prescribed shall be deemed continuing and shall be placed of record in the office of the county clerk either on the face of the subdivision plat or as an attachment thereto. The city council shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land involved and existing uses of the land in the vicinity, the number of persons who will reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of such variance upon traffic conditions and upon public health, safety, convenience, and welfare in the vicinity. No variance will be granted unless the city council finds that an undue hardship exists. The following conditions must be present for consideration:
1. There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land;
2. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area;
3. The granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly subdivision of other lands in the area in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; and
4. A more appropriate design solution exists which is not currently allowed in this chapter.
B. A variance may not be granted in such cases where the only evidence for the granting of the variance is the loss of a potential profit at the time of the lot development and build out. Economic hardship to the subdivider, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship.
C. Such recommendations of the commission and findings of the city council, together with the specific facts on which such findings are based, shall be incorporated in the official minutes of the commission and the city council meetings at which such variance is recommended or granted. Variances may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter so that the public health, safety and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done. The city council may reach a conclusion that a hardship exists if it finds that:
1. The applicant complies strictly with the provisions of this chapter, and no other reasonable use of the property may be made except for the use that is proposed and recommended;
Page 9
2. The hardship to which the applicant complains is one suffered by the applicant rather than by neighbors or the general public;
3. The hardship relates to the applicant's land, rather than personal circumstances;
4. The hardship is unique to the property, rather than one shared by many surrounding properties; and
5. The hardship is not the result of the applicant's own actions or neglectful conduct.
D. In granting variances, the city may impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding properties. All conditions as are imposed shall be placed of record on the face of the subdivision plat or may, as an alternative thereof, be placed of record by separate instrument duly filed for record with the subdivision plat in the office of the county clerk.
E. A variance may, at the sole discretion of the city council, be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified period of time.
F. All conditions imposed by the city council are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this Code.
Sec. 4-8. - Duty of owner, subdivider.
It is the responsibility of the applicant for a subdivision plat to obtain such information and/or documentation as shall be necessary to ensure that the application is in accord with the provisions of this Code and all other law. In this regard, it is suggested that the applicant for a subdivision plat first confer with the city and obtain such written information as may be available from the city prior to making an application for subdivision plat approval and/or submitting any documents to the city for approval. The applicant shall be solely responsible for knowledge of all applicable law, policies and/or procedures as may be then promulgated by the city.
Sec. 4-9. - Application for approval.
Before a subdivision of any tract of land shall occur where the same is divided into two (2) or more tracts to sell or develop the same into separate parcels, or before any permit for the erection or placement of a structure, or for any other reason as may be required by this Code, the subdivider, owner, or proper agent thereof shall apply in writing to the city for initial consideration by the commission for approval of a land subdivision. The application of the subdivider, owner or agent shall conform to requirements of this chapter.

Secs. 4-114-30. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS
Sec. 4-31. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish the procedures and requirements for the submittal, review, recommendation, consideration and action by the commission and the city council on a request for subdivision plat approval and to provide the procedures necessary to ensure the orderly processing of the application for subdivision plat approval in the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction.
Sec. 4-32. - Pre-application.
Prior to submitting an application for subdivision plat approval, the applicant or subdivider may contact the city to obtain information and assistance in land subdivisions before preparing a land plan or the preliminary plat and filing a formal application for approval with the city.
Page 13
Sec. 4-33. - Land plan approval.
A. General requirements. A land plan consisting of a general plan, master plan, and/or concept plan shall be submitted to the city manager or designee for review by the commission prior to or in conjunction with the submittal of any preliminary plat, except as noted below, for any tract of land over fifty (50) acres in size. If the city manager or designee determines that an area less than fifty (50) acres contains unique features or is surrounded by existing or proposed subdivisions with potential limited access, a land plan may be required to be reviewed prior to the preliminary or final plat submittal. The decision of the city manager or designee to require a land plan shall be deemed final and binding as a condition prerequisite to further review of the proposed subdivision plan.
B. Purpose. The purpose of the land plan is to allow the commission to review the proposed major thoroughfare and collector street patterns, land use, environmental issues, conformance to the comprehensive master plan, the property's relationship to adjoining subdivisions or properties, as well as such additional developmental or infrastructure review as deemed necessary by the city.
C. While certain items may be required or supplied without requirement, recommendation of approval of a land plan by the commission to proceed is granted only for infrastructure, thoroughfare and collector street patterns, land use (not density or lot layout), environmental issues, conformance to the master plan, and relationship to adjacent properties. The commission cannot recommend approval beyond this scope.
D. Partial development.Where a phased or partial development is proposed, the land plan area shall include the entire property from which the initial or any subsequent phase is being subdivided. Where the applicant can demonstrate that natural or manmade features, such as creeks and thoroughfares, make unnecessary the inclusion of the entire property in the land plan to adequately review the proposed subdivision for compliance with all of the terms and provisions of this Code, the subdivider may request approval from the commission for a submittal of a smaller land plan area. Boundaries such as thoroughfares (existing or proposed), creeks, political subdivisions, or other such natural or man-made features may be used to delineate the smaller land plan area.
E. Not required. A land plan shall not be required if the preliminary plat(s) contains sufficient information to provide for the proper coordination of development.
F. Application and fees.
1. The land plan shall be accompanied by the completed application and appropriate fees at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the commission meeting at which it is to be considered.
2. Two (2) copies of prints of the proposed subdivision, drawn on sheets at a size of twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches and twelve (12) copies of the
Page 14
print reduced to a size of eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches shall be submitted. After an administrative review of the land plan, a revised submittal may be required. If required, the revised land plan shall be submitted seven (7) days prior to the commission meeting and shall include seven (7) copies of the plan drawn on sheets at a size of twenty-four (24) by thirty-six (36) and eleven (11) copies of the plan reduced to a size of eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches.
G. Traffic impact analysis. Any land plan or subdivision plat involving a change to a thoroughfare plan or is seventy-five (75) acres or more in size must accompany with its application a traffic impact analysis in such format and under such procedures as the city manager or designee may from time to time require or specify. Failure to provide a traffic impact analysis and/or traffic study or to meet any other requirements that may be imposed by the city manager or designee shall be grounds to deny the filing of any subdivision plat tendered or offered for filing.
H. Additionally, a traffic impact analysis may be required by the city manager or designee, or by the commission, to address the following:
1. Increased traffic loadings on existing streets.
2. Traffic patterns and street classifications within proposed development.
3. Traffic control devices within the proposed development and on adjacent streets.
I. Effect of approval. The recommendation by the commission to proceed in relation to the land plan shall not be deemed to grant or vest in the applicant any approvals or grants other than as specifically provided in this Code and does not constitute approval of the subsequent plats within the plan boundaries.
J. The land plan recommendation does not exempt a developer from meeting all ordinances in effect at the time of the recommendation and any and all amendments or newly-adopted ordinances after recommendation and prior to final plat approval, unless agreed to by the city council under a separate development or utility agreement.
K. Length of recommendation. Unless agreed to by the city council under a separate development or utility agreement, the recommendation of a land plan shall be valid for a period of eighteen (18) months. Extension(s) may be approved by the commission for up to an additional six (6) months for a total of two (2) years. Upon approval by the city council of a final plat of individual sections of the development, the land plan approval is automatically extended for an additional eighteen (18) months. However, unless agreed to by the city council under a separate development or utility agreement, the approval of a land plan shall not be valid for a combined period of more than five (5) years.
L. Graphic requirements. The following are the graphic requirements of a land plan:

ARTICLE IV. - PARK LAND, PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES
Sec. 4-116. - Areas for public use.
The subdivider shall give consideration to suitable sites for parks, playgrounds, schools, and other areas for public use so as to conform to with the recommendations of the city council and comprehensive master plan. Any provisions for schools, parks, and other public uses, shall be indicated on the preliminary plat.
Sec. 4-117. - Park land dedication.
A. Purpose of land dedication requirements. This section is enacted in accordance with the home rule powers of the city, granted under the Texas Constitution, and the Statutes of the State of Texas, including, but not by way of limitation, Texas Local Government Code, Chapter 212, as amended. It is hereby declared by the city council that open space and recreational areas in the form of parks are necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of the public. It is further; declared by the city council that the only procedure to provide for such open space and recreational areas is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for the planning and development of property or subdivisions in the city limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. All single-family and multiple-family residential subdivisions, therefore, shall be required to comply with this section.
The primary purpose of the parkland requirements is to ensure that the need for parkland that arises from new development is satisfied by the development, so that those who generate the need for park areas and recreation facilities contribute their proportionate share. Accordingly, when new development occurs, a reasonable contribution is to be made for open space for those who live in the new development so that they may engage in active and passive recreational activities within or near the new development. In some instances, the need for parks resulting from new development may be addressed most effectively through the development and acquisition of community or regional parks, or the improvement or expansion of an existing park, serving several neighborhoods.
It shall be required that a developer of any residential subdivision set aside and convey to the public sufficient and suitable lands for the purpose of parkland, or
Page 55
contribute cash in lieu of land conveyance, or a combination thereof, as determined by the planning commission.
The requirements for the conveyance of parkland established by this section are based in part on the goals and recommendations, needs and standards set forth in the parks and recreation master plan, as amended from time to time, and adopted by the city council. The master plan describes the needs prioritization and implementation plan, standards for parks and recreation units, as well as goals and objectives.
B. Application. This section applies to all property within the city limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. This section also applies to subdivision applications submitted after the effective date of this section, for which plat approval is sought under Articles I and II of this Code, as may be amended from time to time.
C. Exemptions. This section shall not apply and have no effect on the following:
1. Any subdivision that a final plat application has been filed prior to the passage of this section.
2. A division of land into parts greater than five acres, where each part has access and no public improvement is being dedicated, pursuant to Texas Local Government Code, Section 212.004, Plat Required, Subchapter A, Regulation of Subdivisions.
3. Alterations or expansion of an existing residential unit or building of multiple units where no additional residential units are created and where the use is not changed.
4. The construction of accessory buildings or structures.
5. The installation of a replacement HUD-Code manufactured home.
6. The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed residential unit or building of multiple units with a new building of the same size and use.
Any claim of exemption shall be made no later than the time of application for preliminary plat approval. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.
D. Park zones. Park zones established by the city council, after recommendation from the parks board, and shown on the parks and recreation system plan, which is included in the adopted Rosenberg Parks and Recreation Master Plan, shall be prima facie proof that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from any residence located therein. The primary costs of neighborhood and community parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who, by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities.
Page 56
E. Therefore, the following requirements are established to effect the purposes stated above and shall apply to any land to be used for residential purposes.
F. Parkland dedication, fee in-lieu, and public or private development. Dedication of land suitable for parkland and recreation purposes or a contribution of cash in lieu of parkland shall be required for a subdivider who proposes to plat land under the city's subdivision regulations, as may be amended from time to time.
Subsequent change. If the actual number of completed dwelling units exceeds the figure upon which the original dedication or cash contribution was completed, such additional dedication or cash contribution shall be required, and shall be made by payment of cash in lieu of land, or by conveyance of an equivalent land area. All new lots within a replat or addition to an existing subdivision shall comply with the parkland dedication or cash contribution requirements as outlined in this subsection, as specified below.
Methods of dedication, contribution, or development:
1. Parkland dedication. Whenever a final plat is filed of record with the County Clerk of Fort Bend County for residential development in accordance with the platting regulations of the City, such plat shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of an area of land to the City for park purposes.
i. On-site conveyance of parkland. The amount of land required to be dedicated for parkland will be calculated at a rate of six and one-quarter acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, or an equivalent ratio thereof. The following formula shall be used to determine the amount of parkland to be dedicated:
6.25 × (No Units) × (Persons/Unit) = Acres to be dedicated
1,000
The number of persons per unit is based on an average household size of 3.00 persons per household.1 This ratio shall be reviewed and adjusted from time to time, as necessary.

(a) Land plan. Parkland to be conveyed or privately owned shall be designated on the land plan with its general location and acreage denoted.
(b) Preliminary and final plats. Parkland to be conveyed shall be designated as a reserve on both the preliminary and final plats as "Parkland Dedicated to the City of Rosenberg" with the perimeter dimensions and acreage denoted. A note referencing the dedication shall be placed on
Page 57
the final plat. Parkland to be privately owned shall be designated as a private park reserve and so noted on both the preliminary and final plat.
(c) Deed required. Prior to recording the final plat, the subdivider shall deliver to the city a deed, in a form approved by the city attorney, conveying parkland shown on the final plat as approved by the planning commission. The parkland deeded to the city shall not be subject to reservations of record, encumbrances or easements that will interfere with the use of the land for park purposes. The deed delivered to the city shall be recorded in conjunction with the recordation of the final plat.
ii. Off-site conveyance of parkland. Upon affirmative recommendation from the parks board and planning commission and approval of the city council, the city may accept parkland that is not part of a subdivision in order to meet the parkland requirement, subject to the following:
(a) The site proposed to meet the parkland requirement is within the same park zone as that ordinarily required within the subdivision; and
(b) The site meets the park development standards of this section, as described in (iii) below; and,
(c) The site exceeds that required by the subdivision or addition, as specified in (1)(i) above by 20 percent, and
(d) A deed shall be required in accordance with the provisions of (1)(i)(c) above.
(e) No park less than ten acres in size shall be conveyed to the city.
iii. Park improvements required. Parkland conveyed to the city shall be improved as required by this paragraph. The subdivider shall indicate the proposed parkland improvement(s), which shall be constructed in accordance with the site plan, as required in (i) below. Such improvements shall be completed by the subdivider within the time period specified for construction of public improvements in (i) below. An improved park shall, at a minimum, include the following:
(a) Paved frontage with curbs and gutters for all required street frontages abutting the outside perimeter of the parkland;
(b) A sidewalk or trail installed in the park, and/or sidewalk installed along all street frontage of the park with the location approved according to the approved site plan;
(c) Water, wastewater, electrical services, and all other utilities provided to the remainder of the subdivision shall be provided to the park as part of standard subdivision improvements;
Page 58
(d) Lighting along those portions of the required street frontage(s) as well as ample overhead and/or bollard lighting within and throughout the park to provide for a safe and secure environment; and,
(e) The grading of site and installation of grass with irrigation.
(f) Permanently constructed restroom facilities built to city standards and the requirements of the American's with Disabilities Act (ADA). Restroom facilities are required for parks that are three acres or larger in size. Developments for which the cumulative required park acreage is less than three acres in size shall pay a fee equal to 60 percent of the development fee required under subsection (2)(ii) below;
(g) One playscape structure and edged fall surface area with a minimum capacity of 15 children, per industry standards;
(h) Covered picnic table, grill, and trash container at a rate of one per acre, or portion thereof;

(j) Park benches at a rate of two per acre, but no less than two per park.
All park areas and playground equipment shall be in accordance with the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission, Publication 325, as currently amended.
2. Cash in lieu of parkland. The city requires a dedication of land to satisfy at least a portion of the requirements of this section. The amount of parkland that must be dedicated shall equal at least 50 percent of the parkland dedication requirements, provided that the area of such amount equals at least 5,000 square feet. The city may, at its option, require a parkland fee to satisfy the remaining amount of parkland conveyance required, under the following circumstances:
i. When less than five acres is required to be conveyed;
ii. Where the proposed parkland does not meet the standards set forth in (G) below;
iii. When a replat or amending plat within the city limits is submitted with increased density; or,
iv. The city determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain in the zone of the proposed development, or the potential for that area would be better served by expanding or improving an existing park or constructing a larger community or regional park suitable for several neighborhoods.
Page 59
In-lieu fee amount. Where the payment of a fee-in-lieu of parkland dedication is required or acceptable to the city council as provided for in this section, such fee shall be in an amount of $950.00 per residential dwelling unit.
Development fee. In addition to the fee in-lieu of land dedication, there shall also be a fee in the amount of $750.00 per residential dwelling unit, which is equivalent to the amount of required improvements as specified in (F)(1)(iii) above.
Timing of payment. Such payment in lieu of land shall be made at or prior to the time of filing the final plat for record in the county deed records at the courthouse.
Use of cash contribution. Cash payments may be used only for acquisition or improvement of a neighborhood park located within the same park zone as the development. However, it is hereby provided that all fees may be applied to any type of park site if all requisite criteria for the other types of park facilities have been met, as determined by the city. Fees paid in lieu of land for neighborhood parks may be utilized for a community or regional park if such use satisfies the purposes of land dedication as provided for herein, as determined by the city.
Special fund; right to refund:
i. There is hereby established a special fund for the deposit of all sums paid in lieu of parkland dedication under this section, which fund shall be known as the "Parkland Dedication Fund." Funds shall only be released from the parkland dedication fund upon city council approval of a plan to utilize the funds to build or enhance a park within the park zone from which the funds originated.
ii. The city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this section with reference to the individual plats involved. Any funds paid in lieu of land must be expended by the city within ten years after the filing of the final plat, or the filing of the final plat of each phase or section of the contributing subdivision, if a phased development. Such funds shall be spent on a first in, first out basis for each area. If not so expended, the owner(s) of the property on the last day of such period shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of such sum, computed on a square footage of area basis. The owner(s) of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right shall be barred.
3. Private parkland credit. Where park areas and recreational facilities are to be provided in a proposed subdivision, and where such areas and facilities are to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, these areas and facilities may satisfy the requirement of parkland dedication if the following standards are met:
i. The private ownership and maintenance of such areas and facilities are adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance, or restrictions.
Page 60
ii. The use of such areas and facilities are restricted for park and recreational purposes by a recorded covenant, which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city council.
iii. Such areas and facilities for which credit is given shall include improvements for the basic needs of a local park. These improvements must be equivalent to that required in (F)(1)(iii) above to ensure that new neighborhood parks are provided with minimum standard amenities. These improvements shall be required before the final acceptance of the subdivision by the city council after recommendation from the planning commission.
iv. All park areas and playground equipment shall be in accordance with the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission, Publication 325, as currently amended.
v. Dedicated parkland must be established with grass by the developer. This grass and an irrigation system must be installed and approved by the city building official or designee. The homeowners' association is responsible for the irrigation and maintenance of the property.
Required documentation. In order to receive the private parkland credit, the subdivider shall provide documents to the city at the time of final plat filing sufficient to establish that the requirements of (iii) above have been satisfactorily met. In the event that the subdivider proposes to construct the improvements at a later date, as in a phased development, the city shall require that the subdivider obtain a surety bond, performance bond, or other form of guarantee that the recreational amenities will be installed concurrent with the build-out of the subdivision, and in no case greater than two years. The city planner and parks director shall evaluate and approve the documentation submitted prior to any credit being given. In cases where the equivalency of the improvements is disputed, the required level of improvements shall be as finally determined by the city council.
Partial fee required. Subdividers who propose to provide private "resident only" parkland shall pay to the city an amount equal to ten percent the amount of the mandatory dedication determined in accordance with (F)(2) above for deposit in the city's parkland dedication fund for purposes of defraying the financial burden private subdivisions impose on public parks elsewhere in Rosenberg. The value of the dedication provided under this section shall be calculated as specified in (F)(2) above.
Dual park and easement, stormwater drainage facility, or nature reserve. Land that is encumbered by easements, detention areas, lake and drainage channel borders, or other similar characteristics will qualify for private neighborhood parkland in accordance with the following calculation. Twenty-five percent of
Page 61
encumbered private parkland will qualify for private neighborhood parks (0.25:1 ratio), up to 50 percent credit. Additional conditions apply to encumbered parkland, including:
i. Detention areas shall have (i) side slopes of a 5:1 ratio unless otherwise approved by the city, (ii) gravity flow or a pumping system designed to remove all algae, (iii) a bottom with a minimum area of 50 feet by 100 feet in dimension unless otherwise approved by the city, and (iv) field areas with a level, domed design suitable for field sports. Plans with proposed amenities must be approved by the city council, after recommendation from the planning commission. Plans with proposed amenities must be submitted with the preliminary plat in order to receive credit for detention areas.
ii. Drainage ditches and lake borders shall have (i) side slopes of a 5:1 ratio unless otherwise approved by the city council, (ii) hike/bike all-weather paths, landscaping and sodding installed according to the construction standards of the city, (iii) an average minimum width of 30 feet and a minimum width of 20 feet beyond top of bank, and (iv) drainage ditches and lake borders with meandering, natural contour appearances.
iii. Ten percent of lakes and nature reserves or land, which is generally undeveloped and unsuitable for organized recreational activities without substantial development effort, but which provides desirable aesthetic qualities, such as wetlands and other wooded areas, will qualify for private neighborhood parkland (0.10:1 ratio) up to 50 percent credit. Dry bottom detention ponds do not meet the definition of a lake or nature reserve.
4. City purchase of parkland. The city may from time to time decide to purchase land in or near the area of actual or potential development for a community park to serve such actual or potential development. If the city purchases parkland in a park zone, sufficient in size to entirely meet the needs of that zone, subsequent parkland dedications for that park zone shall be in cash. Such cash contribution shall be in the amount as specified in (F)(2) above, which shall go toward reimbursement of the city for its costs to acquire and develop the land as a park.
G. Park development standards. Parkland conveyed to the city as provided in this section shall meet each of the standards set forth below:
1. The parkland shall have frontage on a street equal to or greater than the square root of the total square footage of park area to be conveyed.
2. Unless otherwise approved by the city planner and parks director, parkland that is adjacent to a designated trail shall be designed and located within a subdivision or addition to allow for an extension or connection of a public park or public recreation facility within an abutting subdivision.
Page 62
3. A minimum of 50 percent of the dedicated parkland within a subdivision or addition shall be outside of the 100-year floodplain and shall have a size configuration and topography to be developable for active park purposes.
4. Parkland shall not be encumbered with existing or proposed public utility easements or drainage channels that would unduly restrict the development of the site for recreational purposes.
5. A proposed subdivision adjacent to a park or open space area shall not be designed to restrict reasonable access or visibility into the park. No lots shall have their rear yard abutting a public park unless public access is provided each 400 feet, or portion thereof.
6. Street connections between residential neighborhoods shall be provided, wherever practicable, to provide reasonable access to parks and open space areas to all residents within reasonable proximity to such parks and open space areas. Proposed access and public availability of parkland, both physical and visual, shall be recommended by the planning commission and approved by the city council.
7. In any instance where acreage is dedicated to the city or a homeowners' association as a park or greenway under this section, the dedicating party shall also dedicate a cleared access of at least 20 feet in width from a publicly dedicated street to the park or greenway. The city may waive this requirement if it determined that public street access is sufficient to meet the intent of this requirement.
8. Areas within a school site may be utilized to partially meet the parkland dedication requirements upon approval of the planning commission and approval of the city council, as well as the school district board. Areas in a school site may receive a credit toward the required land dedication subject to approval by the planning commission and final approval by the city council. Such credit shall be on a case-by-case basis and subject to standards as may be determined and considered necessary and appropriate by the city.
9. The location of dedicated parkland may be required at the edge of a subdivision so that additional land may be added at such time as adjacent land is subdivided or acquired for public use. Otherwise, a centralized location is preferred.
10.Any residential street built adjacent to a park shall be constructed to collector width to ensure access and prevent traffic congestion.
11.Sites should have and retain existing trees or other scenic elements.
12.Where a non-residential use must directly abut a park, the use must be separated by a screening wall or fence and landscaping. Access points to the
Page 63
park from the non-residential use may be allowed by the planning commission if a public benefit is established.
H. Parks and recreation master plan considerations. The parks and recreation master plan is intended to provide the city with a guide upon which to base future decisions. Because of the need to consider specific characteristics in the site selection process, the park locations indicated in the plan are general. The actual locations, sizes, and number of parks will be determined when development occurs. The plan will also be used to locate desirable park sites before development occurs, and those sites may be purchased by the city or received as donations.
Park zones are established in the parks and recreation system plan of the adopted Rosenberg Parks and Recreation Master Plan. These zones are configured to indicate the service areas for community parks. Neighborhood parks shall have a minimum separation of one-half mile from the boundaries of other neighborhood or community parks and shall, to the extent practicable, be distributed evenly across the designated park zones. The appropriate location and spacing of neighborhood parks shall be determined by the planning commission through the subdivision development process. Zone boundaries are established that follow, to the extent practicable, key topographic features such as major thoroughfares, streams, and city limit and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) lines.
I. Site plan submission and approval. A site plan must be submitted to the city planner and parks director for review, which shall be approved by the planning commission prior to final plat submittal or upon application of a building permit, as applicable. Such site plan shall include the following:
1. North arrow and scale.
2. Vicinity map indicating the general location of the site and its relationship with adjacent and nearby streets, watercourses and similar features in all directions from the site to a distance of 200 feet.
3. Existing and finished grades or contours at one foot intervals.
4. Identification of any areas on the site or within 200 feet that is within the 100-year floodplain.
5. Sufficient dimensions to indicate relationship between buildings, property lines, parking areas, fields and courts, playground areas, and other elements of the plan.
6. Proposed location of buildings and other structures, fields and courts, playground areas, parking areas, drives, screening, drainage patterns, public streets and any existing easements.
Page 64
7. Location, massing and pattern of existing vegetation and the general extent and character of proposed landscaping and tree preservation.
8. Existing streams, drainage channels, and other bodies of water.
9. Focal points and site amenities.
10.Existing structures on the site and within 100 feet of the site.
11.Street and traffic patterns affecting the site including the location of traffic control devices.
12.Pedestrian and vehicular circulation patterns and improvements.
13.Surrounding uses, activities and influences of the site and adjacent properties within 200 feet, including:
i. Any public streets.
ii. Any drives that exist or which are proposed to the degree that they appear on plans on file with the city.
iii. Any buildings that exist or are proposed to the degree that their location and size are shown on plans on file with the city. One- and two-family residences may be shown in approximate location and general size and shape.
iv. The location, size, cross-section and calculation of any drainage structures, such as culverts, paved or earthen ditches or storm sewers and inlets.
14.Typical building elevations depicting the style, size and exterior construction materials of the buildings proposed. Where several building types are proposed on the plan a separate sketch shall be prepared for each type.
15.The boundary lines of the area included in the site plan, including bearings, dimensions and reference to a point on a recorded plat.
16.Proposed utility connection layouts for water, sewer and electricity.
17.Name and address of the land owner, applicant, architect, landscape architect, planner, engineer, surveyor, or other person involved in the preparation of the plan.
18.Date of preparation of the site plan.

Page 65
shall be complete within 12 months from the date of approval of the plans and specifications.
Completion and acceptance. Park development will be considered complete and a certificate of completion will be issued after the following requirements are met:
1. Improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved plans.
2. All parkland upon which the improvements have been constructed have been dedicated as required by this section.
3. All manufacturer warranties have been provided for any equipment.
Upon issuance of a certificate of completion, subdivider or landowner warrants the improvements for a period of one year. The subdivider and/or landowner shall be liable for any costs required to complete park development if:
1. Subdivider fails to complete the improvements in accordance with the approved plans.
2. Subdivider fails to complete any warranty work.
J. Consideration and approval. Unless provided otherwise in this section, an action by the city shall be by the city council, after consideration of the recommendations of the planning commission and, as applicable, the parks board.

Page 67
(5/8) inch in diameter and thirty-six (36) inches long and set flush with finished grade or top of curb. Plat boundary corners shall be set and shall include a cap or tag with the surveyor's identification. Acceptance by the city shall be contingent upon proper documentation. All lot corner monuments shall be set prior to the issuance of a building permit or the beginning of principal building construction. The lot corner monuments shall be iron rods not less than one-half (½) inch in diameter and twenty-four (24) inches in length.
F. The final approval of the construction and acceptance of the improvements in a subdivision shall be in accordance with the guidelines established in the current design standards.
G. The city shall not issue any permits for construction within the subdivision, within the corporate limits, except permits to construct public improvements until such time as all public improvements of the subdivision have been constructed and accepted by the city or a certified check, performance bond or letter of credit is provided to and accepted by the city. A notation stating the above shall appear on each final plat.
H. Before considering the final plat of a subdivision located all or partially within the city and/or the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, the city council must be satisfied that all public improvements required will be constructed in accordance with the design standards requirements. The subdivider shall, unless the city council has determined otherwise, guarantee these public improvements will be constructed in one (1) of the following ways:
1. Deposit a certified check with, and payable to, the city in an amount equal to the cost to complete such public improvements, including the cost of remaining engineering and inspection services.

Upon approval of the final plat by the city council and prior to it being signed by the city council members, and before said final plat shall be allowed to be recorded in the plat records of the county, the subdivider requesting final plat approval shall, within the time period for which the final plat has been approved by the city, construct all improvements as required by these subdivision regulations and provide a surety instrument guaranteeing their maintenance as required herein. In the event that all public improvements have not been constructed at the time the subdivider requests plat recordation, the subdivider shall provide financial security as described in paragraphs (1), (2) or (3), above in the amount of the improvements not previously constructed. Prior to city council granting this specific approval, the subdivider must request in a letter to the city that the plat will not be recorded in the deed records of the county until such public improvements are constructed or otherwise guaranteed.
ii. In all instances the original copy of the final plat without benefit of required signatures of city officials shall be held in escrow by the administrative officer and shall not be released for any purpose until such time as the conditions of the approval are complied with.
iii. Upon the requirements of this section being satisfied, the final plat shall be considered fully approved, except as otherwise provided for in these regulations. The original copy of the final plat shall be signed by the appropriate city officials and the administrative officer shall cause said final plat to be filed in the plat records of the county, or forwarded to the county for final approval and recordation.
iv. In the event that a performance bond or a letter of credit is the method selected by the subdivider for guaranteeing such improvements, such document shall be subject to the condition that the public improvements will be completed within twelve (12) months after approval of the final plat by the city council, unless a longer time shall be approved by the city council upon the determination that such longer time period would not be unreasonable. In the event that the required public improvements guaranteed by such performance and/or such letter of credit are not or will not be completed within the time specified by the city council, the city council shall have the authority to extend the time period within which the subdivider shall complete the public improvements, subject to the extension of the expiration date of the approval of the plat and the performance bond or letter of credit.
I. Security.
1. Waiver of security. The city council may waive all or a portion of the security requirements of this section if it finds that the public health, safety and general welfare will not be harmed by such waiver. The city council shall take into consideration the extent of public improvements to be installed, the likelihood
Page 69
that such improvements will be installed by the subdivider within the twelve-month period, the impact that may result if such improvements are not timely installed, and the hardship to the subdivider if the security requirements are imposed.
2. Release of security. As a portion of the public improvements are completed in accordance with the design standards, the subdivider may make application to the administrative officer to reduce the amount of the original letter of credit, performance bond or certified check. If the city council is satisfied that such portion of the public improvements has been completed in accordance with current design standards, the city council may cause the amount of the letter of credit, performance bond or certified check to be reduced by such amount that the city council deems appropriate, so that the remaining amount of the letter of credit, performance bond or certified check adequately insures the completion of the remaining public improvements.
3. Determination of amount. A professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Texas shall furnish estimates of the costs of engineering and construction of all required improvements to the administrative officer who shall review the estimates in order to determine the adequacy of the guarantee instrument for insuring the construction of the required facilities.
4. Coordination with county. If the project is located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction and is subject to county bonding requirements, the subdivider may provide the financial security conforming to the above requirements in the name of the county, provided that the current county regulations stipulate that the security will not be reduced or released without written approval by the administrative officer, and provided that the instrument is transferable from the county to the city upon annexation.
J. Approval of final plats shall be deemed to have expired in subdivisions for which no assurances for completion have been posted or the improvements have not been completed within the period of one (1) year. In those cases where a surety instrument has been required and improvements have not been completed within the terms of said surety instrument, the city shall declare the surety to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed, unless extended under the provisions of this section.
K. The city shall inspect all required improvements to ensure compliance with city requirements and approved construction plans. When all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed, the city shall either accept, in writing, the improvements as having been satisfactorily completed, or shall issue a punch list to the developer denoting items remaining to be completed. The city shall not accept dedications of required improvements nor release or reduce a performance bond or other assurance until such time as it determines that:
1. All improvements have been satisfactorily completed;
Page 70
2. The required number of "as built" plans, in both hard copy and electronic formats, have been submitted to and accepted by the city;
3. The required maintenance guarantee has been provided; and
4. Any and all other requirements identified in this chapter or other city codes and ordinances have been satisfied.
L. Before the release of any instrument guaranteeing the construction of required subdivision improvements or the signing of the final plat where subdivision improvements were made prior to the filing of the final plat for recordation, the subdivider shall furnish the city, if in the city limits, or the county, if in the extraterritorial jurisdiction, with a maintenance bond or other surety instrument to assure the quality of materials, workmanship and maintenance of all required improvements. The maintenance bond or other surety instrument shall be approved by the city attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution. Said bond shall be in compliance with the design standards. Whenever a defect or failure of any required improvement occurs within the period of coverage, the city may require that a new maintenance bond or surety instrument be posted for a period of one (1) full calendar year sufficient to cover the corrected defect of failure.
Sec. 4-132. - Flood damage prevention.
The lowest elevation of the first floor of all principal buildings is to be constructed at least one (1) foot above the one hundred-year floodplain. All public streets are to be designed such that the lowest top of curb elevation is equal to or above the one hundred-year floodplain elevation. The one hundred-year floodplain is considered to be the one hundred-year water surface elevation in the outfall channel or receiving stream designated to receive storm runoff from the proposed development. For levied areas subject to multiple outlet condition analysis conforming to the county's criteria, the aforementioned requirement is to be met for all conditions. Special consideration may be given to tracts containing natural aesthetic amenities within existing developed areas and served by existing outfall drainage facilities, where the addition of fill would result in the destruction of the amenities, and for which there is no other feasible method to meet the aforementioned criteria.
Secs. 4-1334-135. - Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. - MISCELLANEOUS
Sec. 4-136. - Map update.
The developer shall submit to the city a digitized copy of the entire subdivision at a scale appropriate to update the city maps and subdivision map. This copy shall comply with requirements established in Chapter 7, Article I, Section 7-5(E).
Page 71
Sec. 4-137. - Schedule of fees.
The following fees shall be charged and paid by any applicant seeking any authority under this chapter. All fees must be paid at the time an application for authority hereunder is made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and shall be provided for in a schedule of fees established by resolution of the city council.

All buildings or structures served by connections shall be located entirely within the boundaries of a lot or parcel shown in a plan, plat or replat filed with and finally approved by the city and city council and duly recorded in the official records of the county where the property is located (provided this limitation shall not apply if no plan, plat or replat is required by applicable state statutes or city ordinances).
Page 6
G. Unless and until the city shall dissolve the MUD and assume the properties, assets, obligations and liabilities of the MUD, the bonds of the MUD, as to both principal and interest, shall be and remain obligations solely of the MUD and shall never be deemed or construed to be obligations or indebtedness of the city.
H. All contracts with third parties for construction of water, wastewater and stormwater facilities to serve the proposed MUD will contain the following provisions:
1. A requirement that all plans and specifications for construction of improvements or modification of improvements which are to be built to serve the MUD and/or require approval of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality be prepared in accordance with the then adopted city specifications and requirements for such facilities and delivered to the city engineer for approval prior to submission to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

A. A completed application for a land disturbance permit must be submitted to the building permit office (as designee of the city manager) on a city form. The application will require a storm water pollution prevention plan, a plan showing the person's best management practices for pollution and erosion control, and other information, including plans, that the city manager or an authorized representative determines is reasonably necessary to administer this article and to protect the public, public property, and waters of the state.
B. The land disturbance permit will be issued if the application complies with the provisions of this chapter. The permit must contain the name, address, and telephone number of the person performing the work, the location of the work, and any other information designated by the city manager or an authorized representative. The permit may also contain special conditions the city manager or an authorized representative determines are necessary to ensure compliance with this article or to protect the public, the municipal storm sewer system, or public property. It is unlawful for any person doing work under a land disturbance permit to violate any special condition or other provision of the land disturbance permit.
C. The permit holder must keep the permit posted at a visible place at the work site and make it available for inspection upon the request of the city manager or an authorized representative.
D. A land disturbance permit issued under this article is valid for the time period specified by the permit, based on the estimated time to complete the work. Upon the written request of the permit holder, the city manager or an authorized representative may grant additional time to complete the work under the land disturbance permit.
E. Any changes made to the storm water pollution prevention plan shall be submitted to the city for approval. Field modifications must be acknowledged by the city, in writing, before implementation.
Sec. 6-53. - Maintenance.
The construction site must have documentation detailing the temporary and permanent maintenance of the site against storm water runoff.
Sec. 6-54. - Inspections.
The city reserves the right to inspect any and all construction sites within the city. The operator of the construction site is obligated to allow any city inspector on site without prior notice.
Page 11
Sec. 6-55. - Responsibility of operators.
All operators with control over the construction site must:
1. Ensure that all applicable parts of TPDES General Permit TXR150000, including any amendments, are met.
2. Ensure that the SWPPP provided to the city indicates the areas of the project where operators have control over project specifications, including the ability to make modifications in specifications.
3. Ensure all other operators affected by modifications in project specifications, especially those adjacent to the site or downstream, are notified in a timely manner so that those operators may modify their BMPs as necessary to remain compliant with the conditions of TPDES General Permit TXR150000, including any amendments.
4. Ensure that the SWPPP, for portions of the project where they are operators, indicates the name and site specific TPDES authorization numbers for permittees with the day-to-day operational control over those activities necessary to ensure compliance with the SWPPP and other permit conditions. If the operator with day-to-day operational control has not been authorized or has abandoned the site, the operator with control over project specifications is considered to be the responsible party until the authority is transferred to another party and the SWPPP is updated.
5. Submit a copy of all paperwork submitted to regional, state, or federal authorities in relation to the storm water management plan.
6. Ensure that all design requirements meet local, state, and federal standards.
Sec. 6-56. - Stop work orders; revocation and appeals.
A. If a person violates a provision of this chapter, the city manager or an authorized representative may issue a written stop work order to the violator directing any work or activity authorized to be done under a land disturbance permit to cease until the violation is corrected. Upon receiving a stop work order, the permit holder must immediately cause all work authorized under the land disturbance permit to stop, but may take steps necessary to secure the site. It is unlawful for any person to continue work under a land disturbance permit after receiving a stop work order or receiving notice that a stop work order has been issued or to resume the work or activity until the city manager or an authorized representative withdraws the stop work order.
Page 12
B. The city manager or an authorized representative may revoke a land disturbance permit for a violation of this article. To revoke a land disturbance permit the city manager or an authorized representative must send or deliver written notice of a violation to the permit holder ordering the violation to be corrected within a specified time. If the permit holder fails to correct the violation as directed, the city manager or an authorized representative may revoke the permit by giving notice to the permit holder in writing.
C. Any person may appeal the denial or revocation of a land disturbance permit, the interpretation or application of a requirement of this article, the issuance of a stop work order or notice of violation, or other requirement or action imposed under this chapter by the city manager or an authorized representative. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the city manager within seventy-two (72) hours of the action being appealed. The city manager or an authorized representative will promptly review the facts and issue a written determination.
D. The revocation and appeal provisions in this section govern over any other conflicting provision in the City's Code of Ordinances.

ARTICLE V. - POST CONSTRUCTION STORM WATER RUNOFF
Sec. 6-70. - Applicability.
This article shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption by the city manager or an authorized representative under the specifications of this article. The article also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. In addition, all plans must also ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of the site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans.
1. To prevent the adverse impacts of storm water runoff, the city shall develop performance standards to be met at new development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one (1) or more acres of land. The following activities may be exempt from these storm water performance criteria:
i. Additions or modifications to existing single family structures;
ii. Developments that do not disturb more than one (1) acre of land, provided they are not part of a larger common development plan; or
iii. Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary by the city manager or an authorized representative.
Page 13
2. When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in Chapter 8 - Definitions, decisions on permitting and on-site storm water requirements shall be determined after a review by the city manager or an authorized representative.
Sec. 6-71. - Permit procedures and requirements.
A. Permit required. No landowner or land operator shall receive any of the building, grading, land disturbance or other land development permits required for land disturbance activities without first meeting the requirements of this chapter prior to commencing the proposed activity.
B. Application requirements. Unless specifically excluded by this article, any landowner or land operator desiring a permit for a land disturbance activity shall submit to the city manager or an authorized representative a permit application on a form provided for that purpose.
Sec. 6-72. - Exemptions to storm water management requirements.
Exemptions for providing storm water management are as follows:
1. Every applicant shall provide for storm water management as required by this chapter, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the storm water management plan requirements shall be submitted to the city manager or an authorized representative for approval.
2. The minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one (1) of the following conditions applies:
i. It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this article;
ii. Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that has been approved by the city manager or an authorized representative and the implementation of the plan is required by local ordinance;
iii. Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long term operation and maintenance of the storm water practice; or
Page 14
iv. Nonstructural practices will be used on the site to reduce: a) the generation of storm water from the site, b) the size and cost of storm water storage and c) the pollutants generated at the site. These nonstructural practices will be explained in detail in the storm water design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the city manager or an authorized representative.
1. In instances where one (1) of the conditions above applies, the city manager or an authorized representative may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these storm water management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city manager or an authorized representative that the variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways:
i. Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, and other structures;
ii. Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
iii. Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or silting; or
iv. Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property.

Sec. 7-24. - Clearance of Water Lines from Other Utilities.
Water mains shall be designed and located to conform to the regulations of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
A. When a water main is placed parallel to another utility line at or near the same grade, it shall have a minimum of four feet (4') of horizontal separation. When the other utility is a sanitary sewer, a minimum of nine feet (9') of separation must be provided. In the event that a minimum of nine feet (9') cannot be maintained, the sanitary sewer must be constructed of pressure type pipe with water-tight joints as
Page 23
used in water main construction and the clearances must be as defined in the following sections or as specifically approved by the City. When a water main crosses a utility other than sanitary sewer, a minimum of six inches (6") of clearance must be maintained, and the water main shall have one joint of pipe, a minimum of eighteen feet (18') long, centered on the other utility.
B. For water mains crossing an existing or proposed sanitary sewer or force main, the following clearances shall be provided for protection from contamination. The minimum clearances will be approved only when justified and field conditions so dictate. The latest edition of "Rules and Regulations for Public Water Systems", Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, shall be followed for minimum criteria and instructions for water line crossings.
C. When water mains and sanitary sewers are installed, they shall be installed no closer to each other than nine feet (9') in all directions and parallel lines must be installed in separate trenches. Where the nine-foot (9') separation distance cannot be achieved, the following procedures shall be used.
1. Where a sanitary sewer parallels the water main, the sanitary sewer shall be constructed of ductile iron or PVC pipe meeting AWWA specifications, having a minimum working pressure rating of one hundred fifty pounds per square inch (150 psi) or greater, and equipped with pressure type joints. The water main and sanitary sewer shall be separated by a minimum vertical distance of two feet (2'), and a minimum horizontal distance of four feet (4'), measured between the nearest outside diameters of the pipes, and the water main shall be located above the sewer.
2. Where a sanitary sewer crosses the water main, and that portion of the sewer within nine feet (9') of the water is constructed as described in Section 7-24(C)(1), the water line may be placed no closer than six inches (6") from the sewer. The separation distance must be measured between the nearest outside pipe diameters. The water line shall be located at a higher elevation than the sewer, wherever possible, and one (1) joint, a minimum of eighteen feet (18') long, of the new pipe must be centered on the existing line.
D. Where water lines are installed in areas which have existing sanitary sewers, every effort should be made to maintain nine feet (9') of separation between the outside pipe diameters of the two lines. Where this separation cannot be achieved because of local conditions, which must be fully documented in any planning material submitted, the following spaces shall be observed.
1. Where a new water line is to cross or be installed in parallel with an existing sanitary sewer, and the sewer is constructed as described in Section 7-24(C)(1), the separation distances specified in those rules shall apply as though the sewer were new.
Page 24
2. Where a new water line is to be installed in parallel with existing clay, truss, or concrete gravity sewer showing no evidence of leakage and the water line is installed above the sewer a minimum of two feet (2') vertically and four feet (4') horizontally, the sanitary sewer need not be disturbed. Should excavation for the water line produce evidence that the sewer is leaking, then the sewer must be repaired.
3. Where a new water main is to cross an existing clay, truss, or concrete gravity sewer showing no evidence of leakage, the sewer need not be disturbed if the water line is to be installed at least twenty-four inches (24") above the existing sewer. A full joint of the water line, at least eighteen feet (18') long, should be centered over the sewer crossing, in this case, so as to provide maximum protection against contamination.
4. Existing clay, truss, or concrete sewer pipe which shows no evidence of leakage and because of physical limitations must remain at a higher elevation than a proposed intersecting water line or closer than two feet (2') may remain undisturbed if the water line is inserted in a joint of pressure type encasement pipe at least eighteen feet (18') long and two (2) nominal sizes larger than the water line. The encasement pipe should be centered on the sewer crossing and both ends sealed with cement grout. In lieu of this procedure, that portion of the sewer within nine feet (9') of the water line may be replaced with cast iron or ductile iron pipe with watertight joints as described in Section 7-24(C)(1), above.
5. Unless sanitary sewer manholes and the connecting sewer can be made completely watertight and tested for no leakage, they must be installed so as to provide a minimum of nine feet (9') of horizontal clearance from an existing or proposed water line. Encasement of the water line in a carrier pipe as described in Section 7-24(D)(4) may be approved in special cases if the plans have approval of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
Sec. 7-25. - Depth of Cover.
Minimum depth of cover for water mains shall be as follows:

Sec. 7-54. - Roadway Geometric Design.
A. Right-of-Way (R.O.W.) Width
Right-of-way width is generally determined by the pavement section (roadway type/classification) required to perform the function and carry the traffic. Other considerations of right-of-way may include the provisions of vehicle safety areas, sidewalks, bus turnouts, bicycle paths, and utility locations.

C. Storage Length
Storage lengths provided in turning lanes should be sufficiently long to store the maximum number of vehicles likely to accumulate during a critical period. A storage length which is too short could cause vehicles to undesirably back up into through traffic lanes.
Storage lengths should be calculated if turning volumes are known or may be accurately estimated. The formula for calculating storage length is:
L = 25N Where:
L = Length of storage lane in feet and,
N = Number of vehicles expected in the queue during the peak thirty (30) minute traffic period, using a Poisson Distribution, ninety percent (90%) confidence level, and a ninety (90) second arrival period.
Page 53
Where analysis indicates that dual left-turn lanes are needed, a lane distribution of fifty-five percent (55%) in the leftmost lane and forty-five percent (45%) in the rightmost lane should be used for calculations.
Unless a longer storage length is indicated by the calculation, the minimum length of a left-turn storage lane for collector level or lower streets is one-hundred feet (100') from the nose to the point of transition. On major streets (collectors and thoroughfares), the minimum length is one-hundred fifty feet (150').
D. Intersection Sight Distance:
Each intersection design should consider the required sight distances before establishing corner right-of-way clips. Unless larger clips are indicated at a particular intersection, a twenty foot by twenty foot (20' X 20') triangular public open space corner clip, measured at the property line, is required on corner lots at the intersection of two public streets. A fifteen foot by fifteen foot (15' X 15') triangular corner clip or easement is required at the intersection of a public street and a dedicated alley. Intersection sight distance requirements shall conform to the major thoroughfare study for criteria.
E. Geometric street design standards shall conform to Appendix F of the Design Standards.

F. Large speed differentials shall be minimized to prevent unsafe conditions. Every attempt should be made to have driveway designs that create no more than 20 mph maximum speed differential on roadways. Driveway approaches accessing major thoroughfares should be situated in a manner that minimizes the number of potential conflict points. Use of deceleration lanes, acceleration lanes, turning lanes, turning bays, shared driveways, access easements for adjoining properties, cross driveway easements (an easement allowing two or more properties to share a common drive(s).), traffic signals and traffic control devices, special lanes for pedestrians, crosswalks, medians and median markings, special signage, and other internal and external designs, signage, devices, markings, etc. shall be considered on all driveway requests.
G. Anyone planning on developing a site, parcel of land, or preparing a parcel of land or site for such shall be prepared to submit a driveway plan for the entire property. If the parcel to be platted is a portion of a larger tract, the city may require all driveways be identified or at a minimum the number, general location and access easements identified to allow joint use of driveway(s) located on separate tracts or parcels on the larger tract before the platting of the smaller tract or sub-parcel. A TIA may be required to take into consideration a larger section of roadway or other
Page 58
roadways other than the roadway immediately adjoining the tract(s) of land under consideration.
H. An individual may be required to negotiate driveway access on an adjacent property prior to or instead of being granted a driveway access on a tract or parcel of land.
I. Driveways serving non-residential and multi-family tracts that connect to a street classified as a thoroughfare or collector street or has a speed limit exceeding 35 mph must be thirty-five (35) feet wide at the right-of-way line. Non-residential and multi-family tracts fronting on all other streets shall be twenty-five (25) to thirty-five (35) feet wide at the right-of-way line.
J. It is the Citys policy to minimize whenever practical the number of non-single family residential driveways on all arterial and collector streets in order to reduce the number of conflict points and facilitate traffic flow. To facilitate that policy, driveways shall be placed no closer than the following distances from adjacent streets and driveways (measured from the turn radius at the curb line to the nearest turn radius at the curb line). More than one driveway may be allowed as long as it meets the following criteria:
Roadway Classification
Minimum Separation
Major Highways, U.S. 59
200 ft. or greater as determined by a Traffic Impact Analysis
Highway, State Hwy 36
200 ft. or greater as determined by a Traffic Impact Analysis
Thoroughfare
165 ft.
Collectors
165 ft.
Local Streets
75 ft.
K. If the separation requirements for non-single family residential driveways cannot be met because of the location of existing driveways on adjoining tracts, joint access driveways, access easements, or cross driveway easements, across adjoining tracts should be used. When minimum separation requirements cannot be met with the existing private driveway on the adjacent property and joint access cannot be obtained, the controlling factor shall be to maximize the distance between the subject propertys private driveway and the public cross street.
L. On streets classified as collectors, thoroughfares (arterials), and highways that do not contain medians, non-residential driveways must align with driveways on the opposite side of the street the minimum separation requirements.
M. At signalized intersection in which one public street terminates at the intersection of a connecting cross street, a driveway should be avoided in the area of the signal at a spacing outlined above and not be placed on the cross street as to be in alignment with the terminating street. If the requirements for driveways otherwise allow the placement of a driveway within the area due to size or a TIA, then the driveway width must match the cross-section of the intersection public street and
Page 59
be properly aligned. Non-residential driveway connections to the public street shall be approved and inspected by the City of Rosenberg.
N. No turn radius with the curb return shall extend beyond the property line of the property when extended in a straight line from the right-of-way to the curb line.
O. Driveways shall be located and designed so as to have adequate sight distances along the intersecting street.
P. Non-residential minimum driveway radii accessing a thoroughfare or greater shall have a radius of thirty-five (35) feet. Radii for driveways on the other roadways shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet. Refer to details as outlined in the Driveway Design Standards, located in the List of Construction Details.
Sec. 7-62. - Fire Lanes.
A. Fire lane easements shall be created on all multi-family and non-residential tracts. Fire lane easements shall be an all-weather driving surface capable of supporting the imposed loads of fire apparatus and subject to the approval of the Fire Official and the Director of Public Works. All fire lane easements must have access to public-access streets.
B. Fire lanes shall be of an unobstructed width of not less than twenty feet (20'), with adequate turning radius capable of supporting the imposed loads of fire apparatus and shall extend for the minimum length necessary to provide access for emergency vehicles as determined by the Fire Official in accordance with accepted fire safety standards. A ninety (90) degree intersection is acceptable with prior approval of the Fire Official. All fire lanes have a minimum vertical clearance of thirteen feet six inches (13' 6").
C. Fire lanes shall be constructed using the same pavement structural requirements as public pavement. Alternate materials may be used with specific approval from the Department of Public Works.
D. Fire lanes shall be designed to drain in compliance with the site development requirements.

Appendix B is available upon request or found on the City of Rosenberg website.
APPENDIX C - SANITARY SEWER - PEAK DESIGN FACTOR
All gravity sewers will be designed to accommodate the peak flow from the contributing drainage area. The peak flow will be computed using the appropriate peaking factor, F, multiplied by the average day flow for the contributing area. For non-residential areas, the peak flow should include consideration of flow characteristics from the anticipated development. In all cases, the design peaking factor, F, shall meet or exceed the values as follows:
An equivalent population less than 5,000 persons,
F = 4
An equivalent population greater than or equal to 5,000 persons,
F = (14/(3.316 + P0.5)) + 1.5
For, P = equivalent population in thousands
Additional consideration of peak flow shall be given for design of pumping stations. The impact of pumping stations on the upstream and downstream sanitary sewer system shall be evaluated. The peak flow for design of a pumping station shall be based on the actual flow into the station. A reduced peak flow, based on the peaking factor presented above, may be used for design of larger pumping stations provided a detailed hydraulic analysis is performed on the sanitary sewer system. Specific approval by the Department of Public Works shall be required prior to use of a reduced peak flow for the design of a pumping station and related sanitary sewer system.
Page 61
APPENDIX D - MANDREL REQUIREMENTS
All gravity sanitary sewers, constructed using P.V.C. pipe, shall be tested using a Mandrel that will measure five percent (5%) deflection in the pipe. ASTM 3034, current, provides diameters for seven and one-half percent (7-1/2%) deflection. Five percent (5%) deflection requirements are listed below.
