PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Saginaw, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code, as supplemented through December 19, 1989, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5 or new chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Home Rule Charter of the City of Saginaw, Texas, as adopted by Ordinance Number 88-1, and effective on January 19, 1988. Amendments to the charter will be indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citation to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated in brackets. The preamble of the charter reads as follows: "Good government can only be defined as that which is wholly and justly participated in by the people who are under its jurisdiction. For that purpose the people of Saginaw, Texas, in exercising their rights of self-government, do ordain and adopt the provisions set forth in the ensuing charter of this city as a step of progress by the people of Saginaw. Copies of this entire document, printed in Spanish, are available in the Office of the City Secretary of the City of Saginaw, Texas.

If entry is refused by the owner or tenant or could not be obtained, the building official is authorized to seek a warrant pursuant to Article 18.05 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure as the same may be amended from time to time. Any warrants issued will constitute authority for the building official to enter upon and inspect the rental unit described therein. 
(Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1, 9-18-18) 
Sec. 10-620. - Release of utilities.

The city health officer shall also investigate the proposed location or existing location and premises where the establishment is being proposed to be operated, and the existing or proposed methods of operation, to determine if any unhealthy or unsanitary conditions or operations exist. If same are found, he shall disapprove the application, unless or until same are corrected to his satisfaction so as not to be a menace to public health.

The operator shall fully defend, protect, indemnify, and hold harmless the City of Saginaw, Texas, its departments, agents, officers, servants, employees, successors, assigns, sponsors, or volunteers from and against each and every claim, demand, or cause of action and any and all liability, damages, obligations, judgments, losses, fines, penalties, costs, fees, and expenses incurred in defense of the City of Saginaw, Texas, its departments, agents, officers, servants, or employees, including, without limitation, personal injuries and death in connection therewith which may be made or asserted by operator, its agents, assigns, or any third parties on account of, arising out of, or in any way incidental to or in connection with the performance of the work performed by the operator under a permit. The operator agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the City of Saginaw, Texas, its departments, its officers, agents, servants, employees, successors, assigns, sponsors, or volunteers from any liabilities or damages suffered as a result of claims, demands, costs, or judgments against the City, its departments, its officers, agents, servants, or employees, created by, or arising out of the acts or omissions of the City of Saginaw occurring on the drill site or operation site in the course and scope of inspecting and permitting the wells including, but not limited to, claims and damages arising in whole or in part from the negligence of the City of Saginaw occurring on the drill site or operation site in the course and scope of inspecting and permitting gas wells. 
IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT THE INDEMNITY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION IS AN INDEMNITY EXTENDED BY THE OPERATOR TO INDEMNIFY AND PROTECT THE CITY OF SAGINAW, TEXAS AND/OR ITS DEPARTMENTS, AGENTS, OFFICERS, SERVANTS, OR EMPLOYEES FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE CITY OF SAGINAW, TEXAS AND/OR ITS DEPARTMENTS, AGENTS, OFFICERS, SERVANTS, OR EMPLOYEES, WHETHER THAT NEGLIGENCE IS THE SOLE OR CONTRIBUTING CAUSE OF THE RESULTANT INJURY, DEATH, AND/OR DAMAGE." 
(4)  Promptly pay all fines, penalties and other assessments imposed due to breach of any terms of the permit. 
(5)  Promptly restore to its former condition any public property damaged by the gas operation. 
(6)  Reimburse the city for all costs incurred in the remediation of released hazardous materials or other environmental impairment clean-up. 
(b)  Bond, irrevocable letter of credit. Prior to the issuance of a gas well permit the operator shall provide the public works department with a security instrument in the form of a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit as follows: 
(1)  Bond. A bond shall be executed by a reliable bonding or insurance institution authorized to do business in the state, acceptable to the city. The bond shall become effective on or before the date the gas well permit is issued and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term or until the well is plugged and abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs last. The operator shall be listed as principal and the instrument shall run to the city, as obligee, and shall be conditioned that the operator will comply with the terms and regulations of this article and the city. The original bond shall be submitted to the gas inspector with a copy of the same provided to the city secretary. 
(2)  Letter of credit. A letter of credit shall be issued by a reliable bank authorized to do business in the state and shall become effective on or before the date the permit is issued. The letter of credit shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term or until the well is plugged and abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs last. The city shall be authorized to draw upon such letter of credit to recover any fines or penalties or costs to remedy assessed under this article. Evidence of the execution of a letter of credit shall be submitted to the city by submitting an original signed letter of credit from the banking institution, with a copy of the same provided to the city secretary. 
(3)  The principal amount of any security instrument shall be $50,000.00 for any single well. If, after completion of a well, the applicant/operator, who initially posted a $50,000.00 bond, has complied with all of the provisions of this article and whose well in the producing stage and all drilling operations have ceased, may submit a request to the gas inspector to reduce the existing bond to $10,000.00 for the remainder of the time the well produces without reworking. During reworking operations, the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be maintained at $50,000.00. If at any time after no less than a 15-day written notice to the operator and a public hearing, the city council shall deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, it may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum of $250,000.00 per well. 
(4)  Whenever the gas inspector finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this article, a written notice shall be given to the operator. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the gas inspector to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. After receipt of such notice, the operator shall, within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay over to the city 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than 30 days unless the failure presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this article. The city shall be authorized to draw against any irrevocable letter of credit or bond to recover such amount due from the operator. Upon receipt of such monies, the city shall proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred other than for the expenditure of said sum in hand. In the event that the well has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the commission, such additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly plug and abandon the well and restore the drill site in conformity with the regulations of this article. 
(5)  In the event the operator does not cause the work to be performed and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable irrevocable letter of credit or bond the city may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action against the operator, or by criminal action against the operator, or by both such methods. 
(6)  When the well or wells covered by said irrevocable letters of credit or bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this article, and in conformity with all regulations of the commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and cancelled.

(c)  The gas board of appeals is authorized to decide by majority vote requests for deviations specifically authorized by this article, such as distance of drilling sites from certain structures and improvements, and hours of operation. The board is likewise authorized to decide by majority vote requests for deviations from landscape and screening requirements. Relevant considerations in determining whether such requests should be granted include the nature and remoteness of the site, the wishes of the owner(s) of the immediately adjacent property impacted by the request, and any proposed measures to offset the impact of the request. The board may impose restrictions to offset the impact of the requests. Requests shall be in writing stating the rationale for the deviation and shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $500.00; provided, however, should the actual cost incurred by the city in administering the appeal exceed this amount, the appellant shall be responsible for the actual cost plus a 15 percent administrative fee. 
(d)  The gas board of appeals shall have and exercise the authority to hear and determine appeals where it is alleged there is error or abuse of discretion regarding the issuance of a gas well permit or the revocation or suspension of any permit issued hereunder, and as provided by this article. Any person or entity whose application is denied by the DRC or whose permit is suspended or revoked may file an appeal to the gas board of appeals. Such appeal shall be in writing, specifying the error or abuse of discretion and shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $500.00; provided, however, should the actual cost incurred by the city in administering the appeal exceed this amount, the appellant shall be responsible for the actual cost plus a 15 percent administrative fee. The gas board of appeals shall review the appeal and any other related information. The gas board of appeals in deciding appeals regarding the issuance of a gas well permit or its revocation or suspension shall consider the grounds for the action appealed from and whether an error of fact or in interpretation of these regulations occurred. The board may reverse or modify the action appealed from only upon the concurring vote of 75 percent of the members of the board present and voting. The only basis for a reversal or modification shall be error in applying these regulations; hardship shall be irrelevant. 
(e)  Notice shall be provided of the date, time and place of a hearing for each request for a deviation and appeal by mailing such notice to the owner of record of each parcel of property located within 700 feet of the well within the city and to the city secretary of each city within such distance. Such notice shall be mailed at least ten days prior to such hearing. 
(f)  Judicial review of board decisions on appeals.

a.  The person whose appeal was denied; 
b.  A city taxpayer; or 
c.  The city manager. 
(2)  The petition must be received for filing by the clerk of the district court within ten days after the date the decision is made by the board. 
(3)  On the presentation of the petition meeting the foregoing requirements, the court may grant a writ of certiorari directed to the board to review the board's decision. The writ must indicate the time by which the board's return must be made and served on the petitioner's attorney, which must be after ten days and may be extended by the court. Granting of the writ does not stay the proceedings on the decision under appeal, but on application and after notice to the board the court may grant a restraining order if due cause is shown. 
(4)  The board's return must concisely state any pertinent and material facts that show the grounds of the decision under appeal. The board is not required to return the original documents on which the board acted but may return certified or sworn copies of the documents or parts of the documents as required by the writ. 
(5)  If after receiving the return the court determines that there is substantial evidence in such return to constitute grounds for reasonable persons to differ as to whether the action of the board in denying the appeal was lawful, the court shall affirm the decision. If the court finds that there is insufficient information contained in such return to make such a determination, and that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or appoint a referee to take evidence as directed. The referee shall report the evidence to the court with the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law. The referee's report constitutes a part of the proceedings on which the court shall make its decision. 
(6)  The court may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the decision that is appealed. Costs shall not be assessed against the board.

(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-176. - Goal for erosion and sediment control at construction sites. 
    Grading, erosion control practices, sediment control practices, and waterway crossings shall meet the design criteria set forth in the most recent version of the city subdivision design ordinance and shall be adequate to prevent transportation of sediment from the site to the satisfaction of the city. Unless otherwise specified by the subdivision design ordinance, the goal for erosion and sediment control at sites over one acre disturbed by construction is achievement of at least the minimum site rating of 0.70 using the site rating system as presented in section 3 of the Storm Water Quality Best Management Practices for Construction Activities - North Central Texas, Second Edition North Central Texas Council of Governments, Arlington, Texas, as may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-177. - General requirements for storm water discharges from construction activities. 
(a)  All operators of construction sites shall use best management practices to control and reduce the discharge, to the MS4 and to waters of the United States, of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other material associated with clearing, grading, excavation, landfilling, and other construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. Any best management practices capable of installation and/or implementation prior to commencement of construction (for example, structural measures) shall be installed and/or implemented prior to commencement of construction at the site or in compliance with a schedule for installation and/or implementation in an applicable SWPPP. The best management practices used at construction sites may include, but not be limited to, the following measures: 
(1)  Ensuring that existing vegetation is preserved where feasible and that disturbed portions of the site are stabilized as soon as practicable in portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or permanently ceased. 
(2)  Use of structural practices to divert flows from exposed soils, store flows, or otherwise limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from the site to the extent feasible; 
(3)  Minimization of the tracking of sediments off-site by vehicles, the generation of dust, and the escape of other windblown waste from the site; 
(4)  Prevention of the discharge of building materials, including cement, lime, concrete, asphalt and mortar, to the MS4 or waters of the United States; 
(5)  Measures to prevent and contain spills of paints, solvents, fuels, septic waste, and other hazardous chemicals and pollutants associated with construction, and to assure proper cleanup and disposal of any such spills in compliance with state, federal, and local requirements; 
(6)  Implementation of proper waste disposal and waste management techniques, including covering waste materials, minimizing ground contact with hazardous chemicals and trash, and installing and maintaining covered receptacles for rubbish and garbage to assure that such waste materials are not blown or carried by rainfall runoff from the site; 
(7)  Timely maintenance of vegetation, erosion and sediment control measures, and other best management practices to maintain them in good and effective operating condition; and 
(8)  Installation of structural measures during the construction process to control pollutants in storm water discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed. Structural measures should be placed on upland soils to the degree attainable. Such installed structural measures may include, but not be limited to, the following: storm water detention structures (including wet ponds); storm water retention structures; flow attenuation by use of open vegetative swales and natural depressions; other velocity dissipation devices; infiltration of runoff on site; and sequential systems which combine several practices. Operators of construction sites are only responsible for the installation and maintenance of storm water management measures prior to final stabilization of the site, and are not responsible for maintenance after storm water discharges associated with construction activity have terminated. 
(b)  Qualified personnel (provided by the operator of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas of any construction site that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm that is 0.5 inches or greater. All erosion and sediment control measures and other identified best management practices shall be observed in order to ensure that they are operating correctly and are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters and the MS4. Based on the results of the inspection, best management practices shall be modified as appropriate, and as soon as is practicable. 
(c)  Any owner of a site of construction activity, whether or not he/she is an operator, is jointly and individually responsible for compliance with the requirements in this section. 
(d)  Any contractor or subcontractor on a site of construction activity, who is not an owner or operator, but who is responsible under his/her contract or subcontract, for implementing a best management practices control measure, is jointly and individually responsible for any willful or negligent failure on his/her part to adequately implement that control measure. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-178. - Management plan submittal and review for storm water discharges from construction activity.

(3)  The management practices described in the plans and observed upon any site inspection conducted are adequate to control and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. 
(c)  If, upon the director's review of the management plans and specifications required by subsection (a), (or any modified plans required by subsection (e)) and any site inspection that the director may conduct, the director determines that the management practices described in the plans or observed upon the site inspection are not adequate to control and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with construction activities to the maximum extent practicable, the director may issue an order prohibiting the commencement, or the continuation, of any construction activity at the site. Any order issued by the director under the authority of this paragraph may be in the form of a compliance order under section 30-187, an emergency cease and desist order under section 30-189, or a stop work order under section 30-190. 
(d)  The city may deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, on the grounds that the management practices described in the plans or observed upon a site inspection by the director are determined not to control and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. 
(e)  Whenever the management practices at a construction site are modified (as a result of change in the construction project, in order to implement more effective management practices, in response to an order or request from the city, or for any other reason), a written description of such modifications of the management practices, signed and sealed by a professional engineer, shall be submitted to the director as soon as possible, but in no case later than seven calendar days following the change in the management practices. 
(f)  The requirements of this section shall not apply to any of the following activities: 
(1)  Any construction activity that results in the disturbance of one or more acres of total land area, or that is part of a common plan of development or sale within which one or more acres of total land area are disturbed, and any other construction activity for which an NPDES permit is required for storm water discharges associated with that construction activity. (In such circumstances, the requirements of section 30-179 apply in lieu of this section.) 
(2)  Any public works construction project that is administered, performed, contracted, or funded (in whole or in part) by the city. 
(3)  Any construction activity, not a part of a larger plan of development of one acres or more, related to the construction, alteration, or addition to a single-family, duplex or four-plex residential structure, or an accessory use to any such structure, where one primary structure is constructed per legal block and the construction activity does not result in the disturbance of more than 12,000 square feet of total land area. 
(4)  Any construction incident to repair or maintenance of a utility line (such as for telecommunications, electricity, water, sewer, and natural gas). (Construction incident to the laying of new utility lines or replacement of existing lines is not exempted from this section by this paragraph.) 
(5)  Interior alteration of an existing building when the alteration does not increase the square footage, area, or height of the building. 
(6)  Construction of a fence, but no exemption is granted by this subparagraph for construction of a retaining wall or a fence that may significantly obstruct or change the direction of flow of water. 
(7)  Any construction activity that the director expressly finds not to cause, or threaten to cause, any discharge of any harmful quantity of any material associated with construction activity into the MS4 or to any other waters of the United States. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-179. - One-acre disturbances from construction activity. 
    All operators of sites of construction activity, including clearing, grading, excavation, and landfilling activities, that result in the disturbance of five or more acres of total land area, or that are part of a common plan of development or sale within which five or more acres of total land area are disturbed, or who are required to obtain an NPDES permit for storm water discharges associated with construction activity, shall comply with the following requirements (in addition to those in section 30-177.) 
(1)  Any operator who intends to obtain coverage for storm water discharges from a construction site under the NPDES general permit for storm water discharges from construction sites (the "construction general permit") shall submit a signed copy of its notice of intent (NOI) to the director of public works, and to any other responsible city departmental director, at least 15 calendar days prior to the commencement of construction activities. If the construction activity is already underway upon the effective date of this article, the NOI shall be submitted within 30 calendar days after the effective date of this article. For storm water discharges from construction sites where the operator changes, an NOI shall be submitted at least two calendar days prior to when the new operator commences work at the site. 
(2)  A storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) shall be prepared and implemented prior to the beginning of construction activities in accordance with the requirements of the construction general permit or any individual NPDES permit issued for storm water discharges from the construction site, and with any additional requirement imposed by or under this article and any other city ordinance. 
(3)  The SWPPP shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a licensed professional engineer. The signature and seal of the licensed professional engineer shall constitute his/her attestation that the SWPPP fully complies with the requirements of the construction general permit, or with any applicable individual NPDES permit issued for storm water discharges from the construction site, and with any additional requirement imposed by or under this article. The SWPPP shall contain the name, title, and business address of the licensed professional engineer signing it, and the date that he/she did so. 
(4)  The SWPPP shall be updated and modified as appropriate and as required by the construction general permit and this article. Any update or modification to the SWPPP shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a licensed professional engineer. 
(5)  The SWPPP shall be prepared and submitted to the director at least 15 calendar days prior to the commencement of construction activities. If the construction activity is already underway upon the effective date of this article, the SWPPP shall be submitted within 30 calendar days after the effective date of this article. 
(6)  A copy of any SWPPP that is required by subsection (2) shall be submitted to the city in conjunction with any application for a building permit, grading permit, site development plan approval, and any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction at the site. 
(7)  If, upon the director's review of the SWPPP (or any modification to the SWPPP) and any site inspection that the director may conduct, the director determines that the SWPPP does not comply with the requirements of the construction general permit, any individual NPDES permit issued for storm water discharge from the construction site, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article, the director may issue an order prohibiting the commencement, or the continuation, of any construction activity at the site. Also, if at any time the director determines that the SWPPP is not being fully implemented, the director may similarly issue an order prohibiting the continuation of any construction activity at the site. Any order issued by the director under the authority of this paragraph may be in the form of a compliance order under section 30-187, an emergency cease and desist order under section 30-189, or a stop work order under section 30-190. 
(8)  Upon review of the SWPPP and any site inspection that is conducted, the city may deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, on the grounds that the SWPPP does not comply with the requirements of the construction general permit, any individual or group NPDES permit issued for storm water discharge from the construction site, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article. Also, if at any time the city determines that the SWPPP is not being fully implemented, the city may similarly deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, at the site. 
(9)  All contractors and subcontractors identified in an SWPPP shall sign a copy of the following certification statement before conducting any professional service identified in the SWPPP: 
I certify under penalty of law that I understand the terms and conditions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit that authorizes the storm water discharges associated with industrial activity from the construction site identified as part of this certification. 
The certification must include the name and title of the person providing the signature; the name, address, and telephone number of the contracting firm; the address (or other identifying description) of the site; and the date the certification is made. 
(10)  The SWPPP, with the licensed professional engineer's signature, seal, and date affixed, and the certifications of contractors and subcontractors required by subsection (9), and with any modifications attached, shall be retained at the construction site from the date of commencement of construction through the date of final stabilization. 
(11)  The operator shall make a copy of the SWPPP and any modification thereto available to the director and any other authorized city inspector at the construction site upon request (as well as to EPA and state inspectors). 
(12)  The director may notify the operator at any time that the SWPPP does not meet the requirements of the construction general permit, any applicable individual NPDES permit issued for storm water discharges from the construction site, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article. Such notification shall identify those provisions of the permit or ordinance which are not being met by the SWPPP, and identify which provisions of the SWPPP require modifications in order to meet such requirements. Within seven calendar days of such notification from the director (or as otherwise provided by the director), the operator shall make the required changes to the SWPPP and shall submit to the director a written certification that the requested modifications have been made. 
(13)  The operator shall modify the SWPPP whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or to the waters of the United States, and which has not otherwise been addressed in the SWPPP, or if the SWPPP proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in storm water discharges associated with construction activity. In addition, the SWPPP shall be modified to identify any new contractor and/or subcontractor that will implement a measure in the SWPPP. All modifications to the SWPPP signed and sealed by a professional engineer shall be submitted to the director within seven calendar days of a change, determination of ineffectiveness (self or city inspection), or effective date of changes in contractor and/or subcontractor. 
(14)  Qualified personnel (provided by the operator of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas of the construction site that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of the storm that is 0.5 inches or greater. Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system. Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWPPP shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters or the MS4. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking. 
(15)  Based on the results of the inspections required by subsection (14), the site description and/or the pollution prevention measures identified in the SWPPP shall be modified as appropriate, but in no case later than seven calendar days following the inspection. Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWPPP within seven calendar days following the inspection. All modifications to the SWPPP shall be submitted to the director within seven calendar days of the date of inspection. 
(16)  A report summarizing the scope of any inspection required by subsection (14), and the name(s) and qualifications of personnel making the inspection, the date(s) of the inspection, major observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP, and actions taken in accordance with subsection (15), shall be made and retained as part of the SWPPP for at least three years from the date that the site is finally stabilized. Such report shall identify any incidence of noncompliance. Where a report does not identify any incidence of noncompliance, the report shall contain a certification that the facility is in compliance with the SWPPP, the facility's NPDES permit, and this article. The report shall be certified and signed by the person responsible for making it. 
(17)  The operator shall retain copies of any SWPPP and all reports required by this article or by the NPDES permit for the site, and records of all data used to complete the NOI, for a period of at least three years from the date that the site is finally stabilized. 
(18)  Where a site has been finally stabilized and all storm water discharges from construction activities that are authorized by this article and by the NPDES permit for those construction activities are eliminated, or where the operator of all storm water discharges at a facility changes, the operator of the construction site shall submit to the director of public works, and to any other responsible city departmental director, a notice of termination (NOT) that includes the information required for notices of termination by the construction general permit. 
(19)  Upon final stabilization of the construction site, the owner (or the duly authorized representative thereof) shall submit to the responsible director written certification by a licensed professional engineer that the site has been finally stabilized. (See definition of final stabilization in this article.) The city may withhold an occupancy or use permit for any premises constructed on the site until such certification of final stabilization has been filed and the responsible director has determined, following any appropriate inspection, that final stabilization has, in fact, occurred and that any required permanent structural controls have been completed.

(a)  All operators of (1) municipal landfills; (2) hazardous waste treatment, disposal, and recovery facilities; (3) industrial facilities that are subject to Section 313 of Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) 42, USC § 11023; and (4) industrial facilities that the director determines are contributing a substantial pollutant loading to the MS4, which are sources of storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Any operator who intends to obtain coverage for storm water discharge associated with industrial activity under the NPDES general permit for storm water discharges associated with industrial activity ("the baseline industrial general permit") or the NPDES storm water multi-sector general permit for industrial activities ("the multi-sector general permit) shall submit a signed copy of its notice of intent (NOI) to the director at least two calendar days prior to the commencement of the industrial activity at the facility. If industrial activity requiring an NPDES storm water permit is already underway upon the effective date of this article, a copy of the permit assignment notice or the NOI shall be submitted within 30 calendar days. Where the operator of a facility with a storm water discharge associated with industrial activity which is covered by an NPDES general permit changes, the new operator of the facility shall submit an NOI at least two calendar days prior to the change. (Note: Reference within this section to an "NPDES general permit" or to the appropriate NPDES general permit shall be deemed to refer to either the baseline industrial general permit or the multi-sector general permit.) 
(2)  A storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) shall be prepared and implemented in accordance with the requirements of the appropriate NPDES general permit or any individual NPDES permit issued for storm water discharges from the industrial facility, and with any additional requirement imposed by or under this article, and any other city ordinance. 
(3)  The SWPPP shall be completed prior to the submittal of the NOI to the director and, for a new industrial operation, prior to the commencement of the industrial activity at the facility. The SWPPP shall be updated and modified as appropriate and as required by the appropriate NPDES general permit and this article. 
(4)  A copy of any NOI that is required by subsection (a)(1) shall be submitted to the city in conjunction with any application for a permit or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue operation of the industrial facility. 
(5)  The director may require any operator who is required by subsection (a)(2) to prepare a SWPPP to submit the SWPPP, and any modifications thereto, to the director for review. Such submittal and review of the SWPPP may be required by the director prior to commencement of or during industrial activity at the facility. 
(6)  Upon the director's review of the SWPPP and any site inspection that he/she may conduct, the city may deny approval of any application for a permit or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue operation of the facility, on the grounds that the SWPPP does not comply with the requirements of the appropriate NPDES general permit or any individual NPDES permit issued for storm water discharges from the industrial facility, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article or other city ordinances. Also, if at any time the director determines that the SWPPP is not being fully implemented, the city may similarly deny approval of any application for a permit or other city approval necessary to commence or continue operation of the industrial facility. 
(7)  The SWPPP, with any modifications attached, shall be retained at the industrial facility from the date of commencement of operations until all storm water discharges associated with industrial activity at the facility are eliminated and the required notice of termination (NOT) has been submitted in accordance with the appropriate NPDES general permit. 
(8)  The operator shall make the SWPPP and any modification thereto available to the director upon request (as well as to EPA and state inspectors). 
(9)  The director may notify the operator at any time that the SWPPP does not meet the requirements of the appropriate NPDES general permit, any applicable individual NPDES permit issued for storm water discharges from the industrial facility, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article or other city ordinances. Such notification shall identify those provisions of the permit or ordinance which are not being met by the SWPPP, and identify which provisions of the SWPPP require modifications in order to meet such requirements. Within 30 calendar days of such notification from the director (or as otherwise provided by the director), the operator shall make the required changes to the SWPPP and shall submit to the director a written certification that the requested changes have been made. 
(10)  The operator shall amend the SWPPP whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or to the waters of the United States, or if the SWPPP proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in storm water discharges associated with industrial activity. 
(11)  Qualified personnel (provided by the operator) shall inspect equipment and areas of the facility specified in the SWPPP at appropriate intervals. A set of tracking or follow-up procedures shall be used to ensure that appropriate actions are taken in response to the inspections. Records of inspection shall be maintained and made available to the director upon request. 
(12)  Qualified personnel (provided by the operator) shall conduct comprehensive site compliance evaluations as required by the appropriate NPDES general permit at intervals of no less than once per year. Based on the results of the compliance evaluation, the description of potential pollutant sources and the pollution prevention measures and controls that are identified in the SWPPP shall be revised as appropriate within two weeks of such evaluation and shall provide for implementation of any changes to the SWPPP in a timely manner, but in no case more than 12 weeks after the compliance evaluation. 
(13)  A report summarizing the scope of the comprehensive site compliance evaluation required by the appropriate NPDES general permit, personnel making the compliance inspection, the date(s) of the inspection, major observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP, and actions taken in accordance with necessary and appropriate plan revisions shall be made and retained as part of the SWPPP for at least one year after all storm water discharges from the facility are eliminated and the required NOT has been submitted. The report shall identify any incidence of noncompliance; or, if the report does not identify any incidence of noncompliance, the report shall contain a certification that the facility is in compliance with the SWPPP, the applicable NPDES permit, and this article. The report shall be signed by the individual responsible for the comprehensive site compliance evaluation, and it shall be submitted to the director within ten calendar days of its completion. 
(14)  If the industrial facility is required by the appropriate NPDES general permit to conduct monitoring, records of the monitoring results shall be retained at the facility and made available to the director upon request. 
(15)  By written notice, the director may require any industrial facility identified in accordance with this section to implement a monitoring program at its expense that includes the submission of quantitative data on the following constituents: 
a.  Any pollutants limited in effluent guidelines subcategories; 
b.  Any pollutant listed in an existing NPDES permit for the facility; 
c.  Oil and grease, COD, pH, 30D5, TSS, total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen; and 
d.  Information on discharges required under 40 CFR 122.21 (g) (7) (iii) and (iv). 
The director may require written reports of any such monitoring to be submitted to him/her. 
(16)  By written notice, the director may require any industrial facility identified in this section to conduct semi-annual or annual monitoring of storm water discharges, or the director may specify an alternative monitoring frequency and/or specify additional parameters to be analyzed. The director may require written reports of any such additional monitoring to be submitted to him/her. 
(17)  The operator shall retain the SWPPP until at least one year after storm water discharges associated with industrial activity at the facility are eliminated, or that operator is no longer operating the facility, and a notice of termination (NOT) in compliance with the appropriate NPDES general permit has been submitted. The operator shall retain all records of all monitoring information, copies of all required reports, and records of all data used to complete the NOI, until at least one year after all storm water discharges associated with industrial activity at the facility are eliminated, or the operator ceases to operate that facility, and the required notice of termination (NOT) has been submitted. 
(18)  For discharges subject to monitoring requirements of the appropriate NPDES general permit, in addition to the records-retention requirements of the paragraph above, operators shall retain records of all monitoring information collected for the period of time required by the appropriate NPDES general permit. Operators must submit such monitoring results, and/or a summary thereof, to the director upon his/her request. 
(19)  Upon the effective date of this article, any discharge composed of coal pile runoff shall comply with the following limitations: 
a.  No discharge shall exceed a maximum concentration for any time of 50 mg/l total suspended solids, nor shall such runoff be diluted with storm water or other flows in order to meet this limitation; 
b.  The pH of such discharges shall be within the range of 6.0-9.0. 
Any untreated overflow from facilities designed, constructed, and operated to treat the volume of coal pile runoff which is associated with a ten-year, 24-hour rainfall event shall not be subject to the 50 mg/l limitation for total suspended solids. 
(20)  Upon the effective date of this article, no discharge shall contain any of the following hazardous metals in a concentration exceeding the maximum concentrations (in mg/l) of each of the hazardous metals listed below: 
Metal Average Daily

(21)  Where all storm water discharges associated with industrial activity that are authorized by this article, and by the NPDES permit for those discharges from industrial activities, are eliminated, or where the operator of storm water discharges associated with industrial activity at a facility changes, the operator of the facility shall submit to the director a notice of termination (NOT) that includes the information required for notices of termination by the appropriate NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Any owner of a facility with a storm water discharge associated with industrial activity to which subsection (a) applies, whether or not he/she is an operator of the facility, is jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the best management practices (BMP) measures required in the SWPPP for the facility. 
(c)  Upon request by the director, all owners and operators of any facility that experience a problem complying with the requirements of this article, the industrial general permit, or any applicable individual or group NPDES permit issued for storm water discharges from the industrial facility, shall consult with the director, any other representative of the city, and any third party designated by the city in an attempt to achieve compliance as soon as practicable. If compliance is not achieved to the city's satisfaction, the city may, in its discretion, report the noncompliance to EPA and/or the state, and/or the city may itself undertake any enforcement action authorized by sections 30-184 through 30-190, and 30-193 through 30-199. Exercise of the city's option for consultation under this subsection shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other enforcement action against any owner or operator of the facility. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-181. - Right of entry: inspection and sampling. 
    The director, or his/her authorized representative, shall have the right to enter the premises of any person discharging storm water to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) or to waters of the United States to determine if the discharger is complying with all requirements of this article, and with any state or federal discharge permit, limitation, or requirement. Dischargers shall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and for the performance of any additional duties. Dischargers shall make available to the sirector, upon request, any SWPPP's, modifications thereto, self-inspection reports, monitoring records, compliance evaluations, notices of intent, and any other records, reports, and other documents related to compliance with this article and with any state or federal discharge permit. 
(1)  Where a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director or his authorized representative(s) will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing his/her responsibilities. 
(2)  The director shall have the right to set up on the discharger's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the discharger's operations. 
(3)  The director may require any discharger to the MS4 or waters of the United States to conduct specified sampling, testing, analysis, and other monitoring of its storm water discharges, and may specify the frequency and parameters of any such required monitoring. 
(4)  The director may require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary at the discharger's expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the discharger at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the discharger. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the discharger's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, adopted August 7, 2007, enacted provisions intended for use as subsections A.-F. To preserve the style of this Code, and at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been redesignated as subsections (1)-(6). 
Sec. 30-182. - Search warrants. 
    If the director, or his/her authorized representative, has been refused access to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article or any state or federal discharge permit, limitation, or requirement, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. For purposes of this section, the director of community development, director of public works, the city engineer, the director of parks and recreation, and the duly authorized representatives of these city departmental directors are declared to be "health officers," as that term is used in the V.T.C.A., Code of Criminal Procedure art. 18.05. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-183. - Reports of violations. 
(a)  All citizens are encouraged to report any spills, releases, illicit connections, other instances of anyone discharging pollutants into the MS4 or waters of the United States, and any other violation of this article of which they become aware, to the director, his/her delegate, or any person designated by the city manager to receive such citizen reports. 
(b)  Such citizen reports may be made by telephone, in writing, or in person. A written record of each citizen report to the city will be prepared and kept on file for a period of three years, and a copy of the city's record of the report will be furnished to the reporting citizen upon request. Also upon request, the city engineer or other responsible city official will inform the reporting citizen of any action undertaken by the city in response to the citizen's report. 
(c)  The operator and the owner of any commercial or industrial activity shall report any spills, releases, illicit connections, or other instances where pollutants are discharged into the MS4 or waters of the United States and any other violation of this article for which they are responsible to the director, his/her delegate, or any person designated by the city manager to receive such reports. 
(d)  The operator and the owner of any commercial or industrial activity shall report all incidents enumerated in subsection (c), in accordance with the following: 
(1)  A hazardous and/or toxic material spill or release shall be immediately reported to the city fire department. 
(2)  Other instances where pollutants are discharged into the MS4 or waters of the United States by spill, release, illicit connections or other means shall be reported to the environmental specialist within the department of public works. 
(e)  Both the operator and the owner of any commercial or industrial activity which has resulted in a spill or release of hazardous/toxic materials or a substance of a polluting nature is responsible for proper notification of the incident to the appropriate county, state, and federal agency. The reporting of a spill/release to the city does not release the owner or operator from reporting to appropriate county, state and federal officials. 
    Thus, dependent on the type of release and the nature of the emergency caused thereby (i.e., life threatening or no), the following agencies, in addition to the environmental specialist within the department of public works, are specified to be notified: 
(1)  Hazardous materials response team, city fire department; 
(2)  City police department; 
(3)  City operations superintendent; 
(4)  Texas Commission on Environmental Quality; and 
(5)  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-184. - Warning notice. 
    When the director finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the director may serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-185. - Notification of violation. 
    When the director finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the director may serve upon that person a written notice of violation. Within ten calendar days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of reoccurrence thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the alleged violator to the director. If the alleged violator denies that any violation occurred and/or contends that no corrective action is necessary, an explanation of the basis of any such denial or contention shall be submitted to the director within ten calendar days of receipt of the notice. Submission of an explanation and/or plan in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance with any provision in this article or any order issued hereunder. Such documents may include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 30-187, 30-188, and 30-189 and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-186. - Show cause hearing. 
    The director may order any person who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, to appear before the director and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the alleged violator specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the alleged violator show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the alleged violator. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the rights and procedures specified in subsection 30-191(g). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the alleged violator. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-187. - Compliance orders. 
    When the director finds that any person has violated, continues to violate, or threatens to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the director may issue an order to the violator directing that the violator come into compliance within a specified time limit, prior to commencement or continuance of operation, or immediately. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the MS4 and waters of the United States. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established by a state or federal standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-188. - Remediation, abatement, and restoration orders. 
    When the director finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, and that such violation has adversely affected the MS4, or the waters of the United States, the director may issue an order to the violator directing him/her to undertake and implement any appropriate action to remediate and/or abate any adverse effects of the violation upon the MS4, or the waters of the United Stares, and/or to restore any part of the MS4, or the waters of the United States. Such remedial, abatement, and restoration action may include, but not be limited to: monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of the adverse effects and determination of the appropriate remedial, abatement, and/or restoration action; confinement, removal, cleanup, treatment, and disposal of any discharged or released pollution or contamination; prevention, minimization, and/or mitigation of any damage to the public health, welfare, or the environment that may result from the violation; restoration or replacement of city property or natural resources damaged by the violation. The order may direct that the remediation, abatement, and/or restoration be accomplished on a specified compliance schedule and/or be completed within a specified period of time. An order issued under this section does not relieve the violator of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of an order under this section shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against any responsible party. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-189. - Emergency cease and desist orders. 
    When the director finds that any person has violated, continues to violate, or threatens to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s), or threatened violation(s), have caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the director may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements of this article; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this section shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The director may allow the person to commence or recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking discharger under this article. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director within ten calendar days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency any other action against the violator. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-190. - Stop work orders. 
    Whenever the director finds that any operator of a construction site has violated, threatens to violate, or continues to violate, any provision of sections 30-176 through 30-189, or any order issued hereunder, the director may issue a stop work order to the operator, and require that a copy of the stop work order be posted at the construction site and distributed to all city departments and divisions whose decisions affect any activity at the site. Unless express written exception is made by the director, the stop work order shall prohibit any further construction activity, or any commencement of construction activity, at the site and shall bar any further inspection or approval by the city associated with a building permit, grading permit, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction or to assume occupancy at the site. Issuance of a stop work order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(Ord. No. 2007-12, § 1, 8-7-07) 
Sec. 30-191. - Reconsideration and hearing. 
(a)  Any person subject to a compliance order under section 30-187, a remediation, abatement, or restoration order under section 30-188, an emergency cease and desist order under section 30-189, or a stop work order under section 30-190 may petition the director to reconsider the basis for his/her order within 15 calendar days of the affected person's notice of issuance of such an order. 
(b)  Failure to submit a timely written petition for reconsideration shall be deemed to be a waiver of any further right to administrative reconsideration or review of the order. 
(c)  In its petition, the petitioning party must indicate the provisions of the order objected to, the reasons for the objection(s), any facts that are contested, the evidence that supports the petitioner's view of the facts, any alternative terms of an order that the petitioner would accept, and whether the petitioning party requests a hearing on its petition.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, METHODS AND DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 38-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 2009-09, § 1, 7-21-09) 
Sec. 38-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2009-09, § 1, 7-21-09) 
Sec. 38-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2009-09, § 1, 7-21-09) 
Sec. 38-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2009-09, § 1, 7-21-09)

(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 2009-09, § 1, 7-21-09) 
Sec. 38-31. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 38-11, subsection 38-21(h), or subsection 38-32(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in subsection 38-22(a)(1) is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at two feet above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of subsection 38-22(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 2009-09, § 1, 7-21-09) 
Sec. 38-32. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections 38-2, 38-3, and 38-4. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of section 38-12, section 38-22, and the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 38-11 or subsection 38-21(8). 
(d)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated by a detailed engineering study for all zone A areas, within 100 feet of the contour lines of zone A areas, and other streams not mapped by FEMA, as indicated on the community's FIRM. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(f)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2009-09, § 1, 7-21-09) 
Sec. 38-33. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-11, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 38-22 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2009-09, § 1, 7-21-09) 
Sec. 38-34. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-12, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulation, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.

In this chapter, a service unit is based on setting a 3/4-inch water meter as the standard size meter for single family residential properties. American Water Works Association (AWWA) meter equivalency data are utilized to compare the demand that larger water meters place on the system to the demand that a standard 3/4-inch meter places on the system. Meter equivalencies are also used to set sanitary sewer impact fee charges, because sanitary sewer return flow is directly related to the amount of water used by each customer. The service units utilized in this chapter are set forth in exhibit "A" attached hereto and incorporated herein.

    No application for new development shall be approved within the city without assessment of impact fees pursuant to this chapter, and no water and sanitary sewer tap shall be issued and no building permit shall be issued unless the applicant or builder has paid the impact fees imposed by and calculated hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 1, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 43-6. - Establishment of water and sanitary sewer service area. 
    The water and sanitary sewer service area shall be the corporate boundaries of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 1, 2-7-06; Ord. No. 2011-21, § 3, 9-20-11) 
Sec. 43-7. - Land use assumptions. 
    Land use assumptions used in the development of impact fees are hereby adopted as shown in exhibit "B" to this chapter. These assumptions may be revised by the city council according to the procedure set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, ch. 395. 
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 1, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 43-8. - Capital improvement plans. 
    The capital improvement plans for the city are hereby adopted as two separate components-a sanitary sewer capital improvement plan and a water capital improvement plan. The capital improvement plans are set forth in exhibit "B" to this chapter. The capital improvement plans may be amended from time to time, pursuant to the procedures set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, ch. 395. 
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 1, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 43-9. - Service units. 
(a)  Service units are established in accordance with generally accepted engineering and planning standards. 
(b)  The water and sanitary sewer impact fees per service unit shall be calculated based on standard water meter sizes as set forth in exhibit "A", or alternatively, as approved by the city manager, based on the recommendation of the city engineer as a result of an engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering services in the state, which demonstrates that the number of service units for the category of service of the new development will be different than the standard service unit. 
(c)  No impact fee shall be assessed or collected for a fire flow connection. However, if routine water service that is not related to fire protection is detected at a fire flow connection, the applicable impact fee will be assessed and based on the typical size of meter required to provide service for the residential, commercial or industrial property. 
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 1, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 43-10. - Impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  The assessed impact fee per service unit is computed by subtracting 50 percent of the total projected cost of implementing the capital improvement plans from the growth-related capital construction cost in the capital improvement plans for that category of capital improvements, and dividing that amount by the total number of projected service units anticipated within the service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development, based on the land use assumptions for that service area. The assessed impact fees per service unit established by category of capital improvements are set forth in exhibit "C" to this chapter. 
(b)  The assessed impact fees in exhibit "C" may be amended by the city council according to the procedures set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code, ch. 395. 
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 1, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 43-11. - Assessment of impact fees. 
(a)  The approval of any subdivision of land for any new development shall include as a condition the assessment of the impact fees applicable to such development. 
(b)  Assessment of the impact fees for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For a new development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this chapter and for which no replatting is necessary prior to water or sanitary sewer tap purchase, assessment shall be upon the effective date of this chapter. 
(2)  For a development which is final platted pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations following the effective date of this chapter, assessment shall be at the time of final plat recordation. 
(c)  Because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole, water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to assessment of an impact fee. However, if the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for regular residential, commercial or industrial purposes as evidenced by the record of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the then current impact fee should be assessed and collected from the current owner of the property for routine usage as domestic capacity. 
(d)  Following assessment of the impact fees pursuant to subsection (b), no additional impact fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases or the property is replatted. 
(e)  In addition to the impact fees assessed in exhibit "C", the applicable Fort Worth access fee for water and sanitary sewer service shall be assessed as shown in exhibit "C" attached hereto. 
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 1, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 43-12. - Calculation of impact fees. 
(a)  Following a request for a building permit or tap purchase for new development, the city manager shall compute impact fees due for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The number of service units shall be determined by the category of service or as otherwise determined by the city manager as provided in subsection 43-9(b); and 
(2)  The total service units shall be multiplied by the appropriate per-unit fee amount determined as set forth in section 43-10. 
(3)  The Fort Worth access fee shall be added to determine the total impact fee due. 
(b)  The total amount of each impact fee due for a new development shall not exceed the amounts shown in exhibit "C". 
(c)  Separate impact fees shall be calculated for water and sanitary sewer service. 
(d)  When a water service or sanitary sewer service is sized up to meet the demand of new development, the collected impact fee shall be the difference between the assessed fee for the new, larger sized water meter and the assessed fee for the size of the existing meter. 
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 1, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 43-13. - Collection of impact fees. 
(a)  No building permit shall be issued or water or sanitary sewer tap allowed until all impact fees have been paid to the city except as provided otherwise by contract. 
(b)  Impact fees shall be collected at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
(c)  On property that was platted prior to the effective date of this chapter, the impact fees collected on any service unit for which a valid building permit is issued within one year of the effective date of this chapter shall be the applicable fees established under ordinance no. 2001-05. Provided, however, if a building permit obtained within one year of the effective date of this chapter subsequently expires, and no new application is made and approved within such period, the new development shall be subject to the payment of the impact fees adopted in this chapter.

(c)  The city manager shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to ensure that impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the purposes authorized in this chapter. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city manager at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this chapter; provided, however, that any fee paid shall be expended within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed ten years from the date the fee is deposited into the account. 
(d)  The city manager shall maintain and keep adequate financial records for each such account, which shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues, which shall account for all monies received, and which shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from each account shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision of uses specified in the capital improvement plans as system-related capital projects. 
(Ord. No. 2006-02, § 1, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 43-15. - Use of proceeds of impact fee accounts.

(4)  The city will not reimburse the property owner or developer for an offset or credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to this chapter or for any value exceeding the total impact fees due for the development for that category of capital improvement, unless otherwise agreed to by the city. 
(f)  An applicant for new development must apply for an offset or credit against impact fees due for the development either at or before the time of fee assessment, or the entitlement to such offset or credit shall be deemed waived. The applicant shall file an application for offsets or credits with the city manager. The contents of the application shall be established by administrative guidelines. The city manager shall provide the applicant, in writing, with a decision on the offset or credit request, including the reasons for the decision. The decision shall specify the maximum value of the offset or credit which may be applied against an impact fee, which value and the date of the determination shall be associated with the plat for the new development. 
(g)  The available offset or credit associated with the plat shall be applied against an impact fee in the following manner: 
(1)  Such offset or credit shall be prorated equally among all service units and remain applicable to such service units, to be applied at time of filing and acceptance of an application for a building permit or tap purchase, as appropriate, against impact fees due. 
(2)  If the total number of service units used by the city in the original offset or credit calculation described in subsection (g)(1) is eventually exceeded by the number of total service units realized by the actual development, the city may, at its sole discretion, collect the full impact fee exclusive of any associated offset or credits for the excess service units. 
(h)  At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative credits or offsets upon petition by the owner in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the city.

Secs. 44-3-44-25. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS 

Sec. 44-26. - Landscape and irrigation requirements. 
(a)  Generally. The requirements herein shall apply to all new nonresidential construction, subdivision development, and multifamily construction other than duplex uses. The requirements for landscaping shall combine the buffer yard requirements, minimum landscape areas on the interior portion of the lot, and minimum landscape areas for parking areas. 
(1)  Existing buildings. Buildings in existence on the effective date of this chapter shall be considered legally nonconforming as it pertains to this chapter. The requirements herein shall apply to new construction necessary to replace a legally nonconforming structure if it has been damaged or destroyed to the extent of 30 percent of its value prior to the damage, or if 30 percent of its structural area has been damaged or destroyed. All construction intended to increase the square footage of the existing building by 30 percent or greater shall be required to meet the requirements herein. Such 30 percent shall be based on the original nonconforming structure in existence on the date of approval of this chapter. The requirements herein shall pertain only to the square footage of the proposed construction. 
(2)  Pad site developments. Pad site developments or ground lease developments shall be required to provide landscaping in accordance, with the interior landscape requirements of section 44-26(d) herein. 
(b)  Buffer yards. A minimum 15-foot buffer (interior parkway) adjacent to the right-of-way of any street is required. If the lot is a corner lot, two frontages shall be required to observe the 15-foot buffer. If more than two frontages exist, then the other right-of-way frontages shall be required to have no more than 71/2 feet of landscaped area. Planting for buffer yards is included in the interior landscape requirements. 
(c)  Subdivision development. Landscaping shall be required for all subdivision development. All developed property having a side or rear yard, which abuts an arterial or collector street, shall be landscaped. The area landscaped shall be in the public right-of-way as directed by the city council through subdivision approval. Landscaping will be required at the ratio indicated: 
(1)  One canopy tree per 70 linear feet of frontage. 
(2)  One understory tree per 35 linear feet of frontage. 
(3)  One shrub per seven linear feet of frontage. 
(4)  Ground cover-all area not covered by lawn grasses. 
(5)  Lawn grasses-all area not covered by other landscaping. 
(d)  Interior landscape area requirements. The amount of landscape area required on the interior of the lot (including buffer yards) shall be based on the square footage of the proposed buildings. For the purposes of this chapter, the square footage of the building will be the square footage of the first floor or the square footage of the largest floor, whichever is greater. For single-story retail anchor tenants having greater than 20,000 square feet of area, the building square footage shall be the front width of the building multiplied by a depth of 60 feet. The required landscape area for each zoning shall be based on the percentage of the floor area as determined above in accordance with the following chart: 
Zoning Percent of floor area MFL, MFM, MFH 50 NC, OC, NR, OP 30 CC 30 LI, HI 10  
(1)  Planting requirements. The following plants shall be required within the interior landscape areas at the ratio indicated: 
a.  One canopy tree per 600 square feet. 
b.  One understory tree per 330 square feet. 
c.  One shrub per 60 square feet. 
d.  Ground cover ten percent of required area. 
(2)  Example. Two story office building (NC zoning), floor has 4,000 square feet. 
First floor 4,000 Effective floor area 4,000 times 30 percent Required landscape area 1,200 square feet Required canopy trees at 1/600 square feet 2 Required understory trees at 1/300 square feet 4 Required shrubs at 1/60 square feet 20 Required ground cover area at ten percent 120 square feet  
(3)  Location requirements. A minimum of 75 percent of all required plant material within the interior landscape areas shall be in the front and/or along either side of the building between the building and/or the interior edge of the required buffer yards. 
(4)  Enhanced pavement credits. For every one foot of enhanced pavement area, the required interior landscape area may be reduced by 1/2 foot. The maximum credit given for enhanced pavement shall be ten percent of the required interior landscape area. 
(5)  Right-of-way landscaping credits. The required interior landscape area may be reduced by a maximum of ten percent when the applicant chooses to establish, irrigate and maintain turf grass within the right-of-way parkway along the front of their property. The percentage credit shall be based on the percentage of the parkway irrigated (i.e. 50 percent of parkway irrigated, five percent credit), in accordance with 44-31(c) herein. 
(e)  Parking lot landscape area requirements. Excluding the LI and HI zoning districts, planter islands shall be provided in parking areas on the basis of ten square feet of landscape area for each parking stall provided. (Approximately one island per 16 stalls.) Each row of parking stalls shall provide the required landscape area; however, it shall be the applicant's right to place the islands near the buildings, throughout the parking, or at the end of the rows away from the building. The city council may modify the island requirement for each row in situations where it would appear beneficial to combine an awkward or hazardous island into a larger island within the parking area. Planter islands shall have a minimum width of eight feet back-to-back if curbed, or nine feet edge-to-edge if not curbed, and shall be equal to the length of the parking stall. Parking lot landscape areas do count towards the total required interior landscape area. 
(1)  Existing trees. The city council may approve variations to the planter island requirements in order to preserve existing trees in interior parking areas. For existing trees the minimum width of the planter island shall be as follows: 
a.  Six inch caliper or less equals eight-foot minimum width. 
b.  Six inch to 12 inch caliper equals 12-foot minimum width. 
c.  Greater than 12 inch caliper equals 18-foot minimum width 
(2)  Planting requirements. A minimum of 50 percent of all planter islands in parking areas shall contain a minimum of one canopy tree with the remaining area in shrubs, ground cover, grasses or seasonal color. Planter islands which have light poles for lighting the parking areas may substitute two understory/accent trees for the required canopy tree. Planting requirements are as follows: 
a.  One canopy tree per 32 parking spaces. 
b.  One understory tree per 16 parking spaces. 
c.  One shrub per four parking spaces. 
(3)  Exemptions. Parking garages are not required to provide landscape areas interior to the parking area. 
(f)  Visibility triangle. No requirements herein shall be deemed to require plantings which would conflict with the visibility triangle at the intersection of public rights-of-way as defined in the subdivision ordinance. Consideration should also be given to visibility at the intersection of major driveways with the public right-of-way. 
(g)  Irrigation requirements. All required landscape areas except for subdivisions and multifamily may be irrigated by an automatic irrigation system, provided however, the same shall be designed and installed by a licensed irrigator, landscape architect or other professional authorized by the state to design or install such systems.

    Texas pollutant discharge elimination system (TPDES) permit means a permit issued by the state commission on environmental quality under authority delegated pursuant to 33 USC 1342(b) that authorizes the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States, whether the permit is applicable on an individual, group or general area-wide basis. 
    Total suspended solids (TSS) means solids that either float on the surface of, or in suspension in, water, sewage or other liquid and which are removable by laboratory filtering. 
    Total toxic organics (TTO) means the sum of masses or concentration of the toxic organic compounds listed in 40 CFR 122 Appendix D, Table II, excluding pesticides, found in industrial users' discharges at a concentration greater than 0.01 mg/l. Only those parameters reasonably suspected to be present, to be determined by the city, if any, shall be analyzed for with non-categorical industries. With categorical industries, the list of TTOs is specific for every applicable federal category. TTO's will be sampled for as stipulated in the particular category or those parameters reasonably suspected to be present, to be determined by the city, where not stipulated. 
    Unpolluted water or waste means any water or liquid waste containing none of the following: phenols or other substances to an extent imparting taste and odor in receiving waters; toxic or poisonous substances in suspension, colloidal state or solution; noxious or odorous gases; more than 10,000 parts per million, by weight, of dissolved solids, of which not more than 2,500 parts per million are chloride; not more than ten parts per million each of TSS and BOD; color not exceeding 50 color units; nor pH value of less than 5.0 nor higher than 12.0 and any water or waste approved for discharge into a stream or waterway by the appropriate state authority. 
    Upset means an exceptional incident in which a discharger unintentionally and temporarily is in a state of noncompliance with the standards established in this division, due to factors beyond the reasonable control of the discharger and excluding noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation thereof. Any affirmative defenses to upset only apply to federal court actions as per subsection 98-56(g)(2) of this division. 
    U.S.C. means the United States Code. 
    User means a person who is a source of an indirect discharge. 
    Wastewater means liquid and water-carried industrial waste and sewage from residential dwellings, commercial buildings, industrial and manufacturing facilities, and institutions, whether treated or untreated, which are contributed to the POTW.

Sec. 98-54. - Special rules relating to industrial dischargers. 
(a)  Compliance with standards. 
(1)  Applicable laws. All dischargers shall be subject to those federal, state, and local requirements and limitations which are the most stringent. 
(2)  Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process water in any way for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this division. 
(3)  Mass limitations. Where deemed appropriate the authority may apply mass limitation expressed in pounds per day of pollutant discharged. 
(4)  Categorical pretreatment standards. 
a.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
b.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
c.  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
d.  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.25. 
(b)  Accidental discharge. 
(1)  Each discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this division. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's cost and expense. When applicable, detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the authority for review, and shall be approved by the authority before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the authority shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division. 
(2)  Dischargers shall telephone and notify the authority immediately upon the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by this division. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions taken. Any discharger discharging slugs of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater system and the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the authority under state or federal law. 
(3)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit to the director a detailed written report, signed by the discharger's authorized representative, which specifies: 
a.  A description and cause of the discharge, including location of the discharge, type, concentration, and volume of water; 
b.  Duration of noncompliance including exact dates and times of noncompliance and, if the noncompliance is continuing, an immediate response to cause the noncompliant discharge to cease; and 
c.  All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent continuation or recurrence of such an upset, slug load, or accidental discharge, spill, or other conditions of noncompliance. 
(4)  Each employer shall instruct all applicable employees, who may cause or discover such a discharge, with respect to emergency notification procedure including the proper telephone number of the authority to be notified. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection. 
(c)  Wastewater discharges into private sewer systems. All dischargers who discharge wastewater into a private sewer system shall comply with this division including section 98-55; provided, however, that flow measurement may be based on metered water consumption.

(d)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(1)  Bypass. Bypass of a discharger's treatment equipment or treatment facility is prohibited and the authority may take enforcement action against the discharger unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastewater, or maintenance during normal periods of downtime. This condition is not satisfied if, in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment, adequate back-up equipment should have been installed to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or maintenance; and 
c.  The discharger submitted advanced, written notice of the need for a bypass. 
(2)  The discharger shall submit oral notice to the authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds categorical standards or other discharge limits within 24 hours of the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. Written notice shall be provided within five days of the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. The written notice shall include a description of the bypass and its causes, duration of the bypass, steps taken to prevent the reoccurrence of the bypass, and must be signed by the authorized representative of the discharger. 
(3)  The authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if it determines that the bypass will meet all of the conditions of subsection (a) of this section. 
(e)  Notification of hazardous waste discharges. All dischargers shall notify the authority, the control authority, the EPA's regional waste management division director, and the approval authority in writing of any discharge into a wastewater system or POTW of any substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261.

g.  Time and duration of discharge; and 
h.  Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the authority to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit application. 
All Group II, III and IV dischargers shall submit an industrial waste questionnaire. The questionnaire will be reviewed by the public works utility superintendent or authorized representative. If deemed necessary, Group II, III or IV dischargers may also be required to obtain a permit as outlined herein. 
(3)  No new Group I, Group IV or Group V or Group VI user shall be allowed to discharge until issued a valid permit. 
(4)  The authority will evaluate the completed applications and data furnished by the discharger and may require additional information. If, after evaluation, the application is deemed satisfactory, then a wastewater discharge permit shall be issued within 60 days after the evaluation is complete. The wastewater discharge permit shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified herein and to the regulations of the authority. 
(5)  If the application is denied, the applicant shall be notified in writing within 30 days of the reasons for such denial. If denial is based on the authority's determination that the applicant cannot meet the wastewater discharge limitations of this division, the authority may specify that the applicant be required to provide pretreatment of the waste before it is deemed acceptable for sewer discharge. 
(6)  Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance activities will be required to comply with this division, pursuant to subsection (a)(5) of this section, the discharger shall provide a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger will provide such additional pretreatment and/or implement added operational and maintenance activities. 
a.  The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the discharger to comply with the requirements of this division including, but not limited to dates relating to hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract(s) for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, and all other acts necessary to achieve compliance with this division. 
b.  The time increments established between milestone dates shall be the shortest practicable for the completion of the required work. Under no circumstances shall the authority permit a time increment for a single step in the compliance schedule to exceed nine months. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for applicable categorical pretreatment standards. 
c.  Not later than 14 days following each milestone date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit a progress report to the authority, including a statement as to whether or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that milestone date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the discharger to return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the authority. 
(7)  Prior to the approval of a permit, unless exempted by the authority, all dischargers shall provide monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and/or flow measurement of wastewaters before entering the sanitary sewer of the authority. Each monitoring facility shall be located on the discharger's premises; provided, however, where such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the discharger, the authority may approve the placement of monitoring facilities in the public street or sidewalk area. All monitoring equipment and facilities shall be maintained in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger. Failure to provide proper monitoring facilities shall be grounds for denial of a permit. 
(b)  Permit conditions. Permits are issued to a specific discharger for specific operation and are not assignable to another discharger or transferable to any other location without the prior written approval of the authority. 
(1)  Wastewater discharge permit transfer may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least 90 days' advance notice to the authority and the authority approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the authority must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
a.  States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and process; 
b.  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
c.  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit. 
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as the date of facility transfer.

a.  A statement that indicates wastewater discharge permit duration, which in no event shall exceed five years; 
b.  A statement that the wastewater discharge permit is nontransferable without prior notification to the city in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section, and provisions for furnishing the new owner or operator with a copy of the existing wastewater discharge permit; 
c.  Effluent limits and best management practices based on applicable general pretreatment standards as set forth in CFR Part 403, categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and state and local law; 
d.  Self monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification, and recordkeeping requirements. These requirements shall include an identification of pollutants (or best management practices) to be monitored, sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type based on federal, state, and local law; and 
e.  Requirements to control slug discharge, if determined by the director to be necessary. 
f.  Permits shall contain a statement of the civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedule may not extend the time for compliance beyond that required by federal, state, and local law. 
(3)  Wastewater discharge permits may contain, but need not be limited to, the following conditions: 
a.  Limits on the average and/or maximum rate of discharge, time of discharge, and/or requirements for flow regulation and equalization; 
b.  Requirements for the installation of pretreatment technology, pollution control, or construction of appropriate containment devices, designed to reduce, eliminate, or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the treatment works; 
c.  Requirements for the development and implementation of spill control plans or other special conditions including management practices necessary to adequately prevent accidental, unanticipated, or non-routine discharges; 
d.  Development and implementation of waste minimization plans to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW, the unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the management of the wastewater discharge to the POTW; 
e.  The unit charge of schedule of user charges and fees for management of the wastewater discharge to the POTW; 
f.  Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and sampling facilities and equipment; 
g.  A statement that compliance with the wastewater discharge permit does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with all applicable federal and state pretreatment standards, including those which become effective during the term of the wastewater discharge permit; and 
h.  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the authority to ensure compliance with this division, and state and federal laws, rules, and regulations. 
(c)  Reporting requirements for dischargers. 
(1)  Baseline report. Within 180 days following the date for final compliance by the discharger with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or 90 days following the commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to a categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the authority a report (in a form provided by the authority and meeting the requirements of 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)), indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M or pretreatment or best management practices is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The report shall also contain: 
a.  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
b.  Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of operations. A brief description of nature, average rate of production, standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  The result of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the authority, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in this section. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the city or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (c)(4) of this section. 
4.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. However, the city may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. Historical data than can represent the current discharge only can be accepted as a baseline report. 
5.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment, best management practices (BMPs) and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this division must meet the requirements set out in this section. 
h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports shall be signed by an authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional as stated in 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)(6). 
(2)  90-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the discharger with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or 90 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the authority a report (on a form provided by the authority and meeting the requirements of 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)), indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons, and BMPs. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. This report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger. 
(3)  Periodic compliance reports. Any discharger subject to a categorical pretreatment standard made a part of this division shall submit to the authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the categorical pretreatment standards hereof, including BMPs. Reports are required after the compliance date of such a pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge, and are to be submitted at least once every six months (on dates specified by the authority). In addition, where applicable, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow specified in this section. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the authority may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The authority, taking into consideration extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of said reports on months other than those specified above. 
a.  In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user, and contributing information as is determined necessary to account for water usage, materials recovery, or disposal practices; and contributing information as is determined necessary to account for water usage, materials recovery, or disposal practices. 
b.  All non-significant categorical industrial (NSCIU) shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the director. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements. 
c.  If the director has determined that a non-significant industrial user (NSIU) needs a permit, then the NSIU shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the director. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements and data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
d.  All periodic compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (c)(9) of this section. 
e.  All wastewater samples shall be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring equipment in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
f.  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (c)(4) of this section, the results of this monitoring, including chain-of-custody forms, shall be included in the report. 
(4)  Analysis and sampling procedures. 
a.  All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator of the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by EPA. Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where EPA determines that the Part 136 techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by EPA. 
b.  Sample collection. 
1.  Except as indicated in subsections 2. and 3. of this subsection, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the authority may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
3.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsections (c)(1) and (2) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. 
4.  For the reports required by paragraphs in subsection (c)(3) [40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(5)  Reporting additional monitoring. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the authority, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (c)(4) of this section, the results of this monitoring along with chain-of-custody forms shall be included in the report. 
(6)  Significant non-categorical industrial user reporting. Significant non-categorical industrial users shall submit to the authority at least once every six months (on dates as specified by the authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the authority. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in subsection (c)(4) of this section. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the authority in lieu of the significant non-categorical industrial user. 
(7)  Notification of changed discharge. Dischargers shall give prior written notification to the authority and City of Fort Worth of any potential or actual significant changes in the volume or character of pollutants in the discharge and any changes at its facility that affect the potential for a slug discharge. 
a.  The notification to the authority shall be received at least 90 days prior to change. 
b.  The authority may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
c.  The authority may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
d.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases or decreases of 20 percent or greater, the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, and the deletion of any pollutant regulated by this division or a permit issued pursuant to this division. 
(8)  Authority monitoring. Sampling and analysis for the reports required by subsections (c)(1), (2), (3) and (6) of this section, may be performed by the authority in lieu of the discharger. If all information required for the report, including flow data, is collected by the authority, the discharger will be required to submit the report or certifications. 
(9)  Signatory requirements. All applications and compliance reports submitted to the authority must contain the following certification statement and be signed by the authorized representative: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information and for not reporting known violations, including possibility of fine and imprisonment." 
Annual certification for non-significant categorical industrial users. A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user by the director pursuant to sections 98-51 and 98-55(a)(1) must annually submit the following certification statement signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in 40 CFR 403.120(1)). This certification must accompany an alternative report required by the director: 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR ___, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from _______, _______ to _______, _______ [months, days, year]: 
(A)  The facility described as ___________ [facility name] met the definition of a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial User as described Sections 98-51 and 98-55(a)(1). 
(B)  The facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards and requirements during this reporting period; and 
(C)  The facility never discharged categorical process wastewater on any given day during this reporting period. 
This compliance certification is based on the following information: 
_____
_____
(10)  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the authority, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 30 days of the request. The authority is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
(d)  Inspection and flow measurement. 
(1)  Inspection. At least once a year, the director shall inspect and sample each significant industrial user (SIU, NSCIU and NSIU). However, the director may inspect and sample each SIU as frequently as needed during the pretreatment year. The director shall evaluate whether each SIU needs a plan to control slug discharges at the time of SIU determination, or at least by the first year. This assessment shall be documented as part of the records. 
a.  The authority may inspect the facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of this division. The discharger shall allow the authority or its representatives to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection, sampling, or examination of records. All reports and records related to the provisions of this division shall be made available for copying and inspection by the authority. The discharger shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples and analysis and whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities should be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications, and such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner so as to enable the city to perform independent monitoring activities. The authority shall have the right to set upon the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and metering or measuring operations. The inspectors, agents or representatives of the authority charged with the enforcement of this division shall be deemed to be performing a governmental function for the benefit and health and welfare of the general public and neither the authority nor any individual inspector, agent or representative shall be held liable for any loss or damage, whether real or asserted, caused or alleged to have been caused as a result of the performance of such governmental function. The failure or refusal of such owner or discharger to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the disconnection of water or sewer service to the facility. If entry is denied or a person in control cannot be located, the director shall have every recourse provided by law to secure entry. Such recourse shall include the right to obtain a search warrant under the guidelines of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure; and for the purposes of same, any person with enforcement authority under this chapter is hereby declared to be a "health officer." 
b.  Facilities regulated under this division are subject to the authority of the following agencies concerning access to information and right of entry onto property for purposes of implementing and enforcing federal and state pretreatment programs and other applicable law: 
1.  The EPA under Section 308 of the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. section 3318), as amended; and 
2.  The state commission on environmental quality (TCEQ) under V.T.C.A., Water Code §§ 26.014 and 26.015, as amended, and V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code §§ 361.032 and 361.037, as amended, provisions of the Texas Water Code and Texas Health Safety Code. 
c.  The industrial waste discharged or deposited into the sanitary sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by the authority. Samples shall be collected in such manner as to be representative of the character and concentration of the waste under operational conditions. The laboratory methods used in the examination of said waste shall be those set forth in 40 CFR Part 136. The determination of the character and concentration of industrial waste shall be made at such times and on such schedules as may be established by the authority. Should a discharger desire a determination of the quality of such industrial waste be made at some time other than that scheduled by the authority, such special determination may be made by the authority at the expense of the owner or discharger. 
d.  The authority shall conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards. The authority shall inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year. The result of such activities shall be available to the approval authority upon request. 
(2)  NOV/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
a.  The authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
b.  The authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(3)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used in computing sewage charges shall be based upon metered water consumption or discharge as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the city's water department. 
a.  Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director that a substantial portion of the metered water does not enter the sanitary sewer, the director may require or permit the installation of additional approved meters at the owner's expense, to measure the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system. If approved by the director, the measured quantity of water actually entering the sewer system will be used to determine the sewer service charge. 
b.  Any discharger who procures all or part of its water supply from sources other than the city's water department, all or part of which is subsequently discharged into the sanitary sewer, shall install and maintain at its expense an effluent meter or flow measuring device approved by the director for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing sewer service charges. Such meters or measuring devices shall be read monthly. 
c.  If the director determines that it is not practicable to measure the quantity or quality of waste by the aforesaid meters or monitoring devices, the quantity or quality of the waste shall be determined in any manner or method the director may find practicable in order to arrive at the percentage of water entering the sanitary sewage system of the authority and/or the quality of the sewage to be used to determine the sewer service charge. 
(e)  Permit modifications. 
(1)  The authority reserves the right to amend any permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by the authority with applicable laws and regulations. The authority may amend any permit for good cause including, but not limited to the following: 
a.  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
b.  Material or substantial alterations or additions to the discharger's operation processes, or discharge volume or character which were not considered in drafting the effective permit. 
c.  A change in any condition in either the industrial user or the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge. 
d.  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the authority's collection and treatment systems, POTW personnel or the receiving waters. 
e.  Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit. 
f.  Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts in the permit application or in any required reporting. 
g.  To correct typographical or other errors in the permit. 
h.  To reflect transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a new owner/operator. 
i.  Upon request of the permittee, provided such request does not create a violation of any applicable requirements, standards, laws, or rules and regulations. 
j.  To incorporate, revise, or revoke new or existing best management practices. 
(2)  All categorical pretreatment standards promulgated and adopted by the EPA after the effective date of this division shall automatically become a part of this division. Where a discharger, subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted an application for a permit as required by subsection (a)(2) of this section, the discharger shall apply for a permit from the authority within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable categorical pretreatment standard by the EPA. In addition, the discharger with an existing permit shall submit to the authority within 180 days after promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, the information required by subsection (c)(1) of this section. The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(f)  Confidential information. 
(1)  All information and data submitted by a discharger to the authority or POTW may be submitted to any state or federal agency governing the POTW. Such information shall be considered subject to public disclosure, provided, however, that the discharger may request that information not be subject to public disclosure, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 2 as follows: 
a.  A discharger may assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information in a manner described below, and that information covered by such a claim will be disclosed only by means of the procedures set forth below. 
b.  If no claim of business confidentiality is asserted, all information will be subject to public disclosure without further notice to the discharger. 
(2)  Asserting business confidentiality claim. A discharger which is submitting information to the authority may assert a business confidentiality claim covering the information by placing on or attaching to the information, at the time it is submitted to the Authority, a cover sheet, stamped or typed legend, or other suitable form of notice employing language such as "trade secret," "proprietary," or "company confidential." Allegedly confidential portions of otherwise non-confidential documents should be clearly identified by the discharger, and may be submitted separately to facilitate identification and handling by the authority. If the discharger desires confidential treatment only until a certain date or until the occurrence of a certain event, the notice should so state. 
(3)  Nothing in this division shall prevent the disclosure of information and data regarding the nature and content of a discharger's effluent, and the frequency of discharge, or a standard or limitation to be met by the discharger, and this information shall be available to the public with no restrictions. Effluent data which cannot be held as confidential is as defined in 40 CFR 2.302. 
(4)  The provisions of this subsection shall be subject to any public disclosure requirements which may exist under the Texas Public Information Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code ch. 552, as amended. 
(g)  Wastewater discharge permit reissuance. A user with an expiring wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section, a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. 
(Ord. No. 2012-01, § 1, 1-17-12) 
Sec. 98-56. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Non-emergency termination. 
(1)  A user who violates the following conditions is subject to the termination of its city-provided water supply and/or its discharge: 
a.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
b.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
d.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; 
e.  Violation of the pretreatment standards of this division; 
f.  Pay sewer charges;

i.  Failure to meet effluent limitations; including best management practices, based on applicable pretreatment standards; or 
j.  User who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this division, individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(b)  Notice of violation. 
(1)  Whenever the authority finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies non-emergency termination of water supply, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the authority shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger a written notice, either by personal delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. The user may petition for a reconsideration and hearing. 
(2)  Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond in writing to the authority, advising of its position with respect to the allegations, including an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of a reoccurrence of the violation. Such plan shall include specific actions to be taken by the violator. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof. 
(3)  The user shall not recommence its discharge, nor shall it be re-issued a permit, until the director so authorizes, and: 
a.  The user presents proof satisfactory to the director that the noncomplying discharge has ceased; 
b.  The user presents proof satisfactory to the director that the conditions creating the threat of imminent and substantial danger have been eliminated; 
c.  The user pays the city for all costs the city will incur in reinstating services. 
(4)  Exercise of the authority by the director under this subsection shall not be a bar to, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(c)  Administrative orders. Where the violation of subsection (a) of this section is not corrected by means of enforcement action listed in subsection (b) of this section, the following enforcement escalations may be used. Terms may or may not be negotiated with industrial users. 
(1)  Consent order. An agreement between the authority and the industrial user normally containing three elements: 
a.  Compliance schedules; 
b.  Stipulated fines or remedial actions; and 
c.  Signatures of the authority and authorized representatives. 
(2)  Show cause order. An order which directs the user to appear before the city to explain its noncompliance and show cause why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not be levied. Typically used after informal contacts or NOV's have failed to resolve noncompliance; however, it can be used at any time. 
(3)  Compliance order. An order which directs the industrial user to achieve or restore compliance by a date specified in the order. Terms need not be discussed with the industry in advance. Typically used when noncompliance cannot be resolved without construction, repair, or process changes, or to require development of management practices, spill prevention programs, and other pretreatment program requirements. 
(d)  Right of appeal of administrative ruling. Any discharger or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the authority on any matter covered by this division and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this division or deals with a permit issued pursuant hereto for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply; provided, however, the authority may take any action it deems necessary to protect its wastewater collection and treatment system or to comply with its TPDES permit or to comply with any contract the authority has for the treatment of wastewater. 
(e)  Judicial proceedings. The authority, with respect to the conduct of any discharger contrary to the provisions of this division may authorize its attorney to commence any legal action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable and/or legal relief. 
(1)  Injunctive relief. When the authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the authority may petition, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 54, a district court or other court of proper jurisdiction of the county through its attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of the user. The authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunction relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(2)  Civil penalties. The authority may also seek to recover civil penalties of up to $5,000.00 per day pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 54.018. 
(3)  Criminal proceedings. Notwithstanding any notice provisions contained in this division, any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this division commits an offense. The person shall be fined not more than $2,000.00 for each offense. 
(f)  Emergency suspension of service and discharge permits. 
(1)  The authority, may, for good cause shown, suspend water or wastewater service to the discharger's facility when it appears to the authority that an actual or threatened discharge presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the environment, interfere with the operation of a POTW, violate any pretreatment limits imposed by this division or any permit issued pursuant to this division. Any discharger notified of the suspension of the authority's water or wastewater service and/or the discharger's permit, shall within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the authority, cease all discharges. In the event of the failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the authority may commence judicial proceedings to compel the discharger's compliance with such order or may immediately disconnect such discharger's service line from the city water and sanitary sewer system. In the case of emergency disconnection of service, the director shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner or discharger before disconnecting the service line. The party whose service has been disconnected shall have an opportunity for a hearing on the issue of the illegal discharge and the disconnection as soon as possible after such disconnection has taken place. 
(2)  The authority may reinstate the permit and/or the wastewater or water service upon proof by the discharger of the cessation of the noncomplying discharge or elimination of conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above. The water and/or wastewater service shall be reconnected at the discharger's expense. 
(g)  Affirmative defenses. 
(1)  Affirmative defenses to discharge violations for action in municipal or state court. In an action brought in municipal or state court, if a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of this division or a permit issued under this division was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation of this division or the permit. In an enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. In the event that an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe has been established the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent possible until such time as the reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(2)  Affirmative defenses to upset. In an action brought in federal court, it is an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards that the noncompliance was caused by upset, if the user demonstrates, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and any discharger who experiences an upset in operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this division shall inform the authority within 24 hours of first awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where such information is given orally, the authority may at its discretion require the discharger to file a written report within five working days. The report shall specify:

(Ord. No. 2002-02, § 1, 2-19-02) 
Sec. 98-212. - Education and information. 
    The city recognizes that water conservation significantly benefits individuals and communities in terms of long-term availability and costs. The most readily available and lowest cost method of promoting water conservation is to inform the retail water users about ways to save water in homes and businesses, in landscaping and lawn uses, and in recreational uses. The city will provide the information to retail customers in the following manner: 
(1)  Initial year program. 
a.  The public education program during the initial year shall include all the activities outlined in the long-term program below, plus: 
b.  Distribution of a fact sheet explaining the water conservation and emergency water demand management plan shall be made available upon adoption of the plan.

d.  One additional distribution of educational material in the form of a door-to-door handout, mail-out, or information added to the water bill. 
(2)  Public involvement . Opportunity for the public to provide input into the preparation of the plan will be provided by the city by means of flyers so citizens can call in with their input. We will also conduct public meetings to gather input from citizens as well as visitations to civic organizations and homeowners associations to receive their input. 
(3)  Public education . The city will periodically provide the public with information about the plan, including information about the conditions under which each stage of the plan is to be initiated or terminated and the drought response measures to be implemented in each stage. This information will be provided by means of notices in utility bills, flyers, cable TV, scheduled public meetings, and visitations to civic organizations, TV, radio, newspaper, signage, and web page. 
(4)  Coordination with regional water planning groups . The service area of the city is located within the North Texas Municipal Water District Regional Planning group and the city has provided a copy of this plan to the North Texas Municipal Water District. 
(5)  Long-term program .

Sec. 98-263. - Computation of rates. 
(a)  All above charges shall be computed on a monthly basis for both water and sewer service. The monthly volume of wastewater generated by a residential user shall be determined on March 1 of each year and be defined as one of the following: 
(1)  The average monthly-metered water used by the particular residential connection during the three months of November, December, and January. The average shall include the actual water usage in November and December of the preceding year and January of the current year in which the average is calculated. The average shall be calculated by adding the total metered water for the three months and dividing the sum by the figure three. The maximum winter monthly average shall not exceed 20,000 gallons for residential connections. 
(2)  For a residential connection that does not have prior water use history for determining the average wastewater generated, the average shall be established to be 8,000 gallons per month. At such time as a water use history can be established for the particular connection this subsection shall cease to apply and the average shall be calculated in accordance with subsection (1) above. 
(b)  The average monthly volume of wastewater determined by the above methods shall be utilized for a full calendar year or until March 1 of the following year. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (c), the charge for the monthly volume of wastewater generated by a residential user for 2006 through January 2007 shall be based on the average monthly-metered water used during the winter months of November and December, 2004, and January 2005. In no event shall the volume used to compute this monthly charge exceed 20,000 gallons. Where no previous winter quarter average is available from the records, the volume to be used for this monthly volume charge shall be calculated in accordance with subsection (a)(2).

3.  To recognize changes in technology, the style of living, or manner of doing business. 
Every proposal to amend these regulations shall be considered in light of the above declaration of policy and by the purposes enumerated in the preamble to these regulations. 
B.  Authority to amend ordinance. The council may from time to time, after receiving a final report thereon by the commission and after public hearings required by law, amend, supplement or change the regulations herein provided or the boundaries of the zoning districts. Any amendment, supplement or change may be ordered for consideration by the council, be initiated by the commission, or be requested by proposal of the owner of the property or by a person holding a lease on the property with the consent of its owner. The commission on its own motion, or on request of council, may initiate consideration of a change in any district boundary or zoning regulation whenever it finds that public benefit will derive from consideration of such matter. 
C.  Procedure. 
1.  Proposal required. Every proposal to amend these regulations shall be considered in light of the above declaration of policy and by the purposes enumerated in section 1-1.B, Interpretation and Purposes. 
2.  Public hearing and notice. Prior to making its report to the council, the commission shall hold at least one public hearing thereon. Written notice of all public hearings on proposed changes in district boundaries shall be sent to all owners of property, or to the person rendering the same for city taxes, located within 200 feet of any property affected thereby, before the tenth day before the date such hearing is held. Such notice may be served by using the last known address as listed on the city tax roll and depositing the notice, postage paid, in the United States mail. 
3.  Commission report. The commission, after the public hearing is closed, shall prepare its report and recommendations on the proposed change stating its findings, its evaluation of the request and of the relationship of the request to the city plan at such time as a city plan has been adopted by council. The commission may defer its report for not more than 90 days until it has had opportunity to consider other proposed changes which may have a direct bearing thereon. In making its determination, the commission shall consider the following factors: 
a.  Whether the uses permitted by the proposed change would be appropriate in the area concerned; 
b.  Whether adequate public school facilities and other public services exist or can be provided to serve the needs of additional residences likely to be constructed as a result of such change, and the consequences of such change; 
c.  Whether the proposed change is in accord with any existing or proposed plans for providing public water supply and sanitary sewers to the area; 
d.  The amount of vacant land currently classified for similar development in the vicinity and elsewhere in the city, and any special circumstances which may make a substantial part of such vacant land unavailable for development; 
e.  The recent rate at which land is being developed in the proposed zoning district, particularly in the vicinity of the proposed change; 
f.  How other areas designated for similar development will be, or are likely to be, affected if the proposed amendment is approved, and whether such designation for other areas should be modified also. 
4.  Council consideration. 
a.  Proposal recommended for approval. Every proposal which is recommended favorably by the commission shall be forwarded to the council for setting and holding of public hearing thereon. No change, however, shall become effective until after the adoption of an ordinance for same and its publication as required by law. 
b.  Proposal recommended for denial. When the commission determines that a proposal should be denied it shall so report and recommend to the council. No hearing shall be set on the proposal until and unless the council has reviewed the recommendations of the commission, has considered any appeal, as provided below, and has adopted a motion setting the matter for hearing. 
c.  Appeal procedure. An appeal from the decision of the commission may be taken whenever any party in interest is aggrieved by the action of the commission on a specific proposal. such appeal shall show that the commission either 1) has been prejudiced in its deliberation, or 2) has not been given the opportunity to consider certain information because it could not have been made available to the commission at the time of its public hearing, or 3) the decision is not in conformity with the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance. The following procedure shall be required: 
(1)  The aggrieved party shall submit his appeal in writing stating specifically how, in his opinion, the commission committed error. He shall file his appeal with the city secretary and the commission within 30 days following the commission action. The city secretary shall forward the appeal to the council with the regular report of commission action on the subject proposal. 
(2)  Upon receipt of written appeal the council shall determine whether or not the commission committed error. If the council concludes that certain previously unavailable information should be considered by the commission, it may refer the original proposal and the appeal for a new hearing, new report and recommendation. If the council concludes that commission prejudice prevents a fair hearing or recommendation, the council may schedule its own hearing on the original proposal and recommendation. If the council concludes that the decision of the commission is not in conformity with the purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance it may either give guidance to the commission and refer the proposal and appeal for a new hearing, new report and recommendation or it may schedule its own hearing on the original proposal. 
5.  Council hearing and notice. The council may from time to time amend, supplement, or change by ordinance the boundaries of the districts or the regulations herein established. A public hearing on such amendment, supplement, or change shall be held by the council. Notice of council hearing shall be given by publication one time in the official paper of the city, stating the time and place of such hearing, which time shall not be earlier than 15 days from the date of publication. 
6.  Negative recommendations; written protest. An amendment, supplement, or change shall not become effective except by favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the council eligible to vote: 
a.  If the commission recommends disapproval of the proposed change, or 
b.  If written protest is filed by the owners of 20 percent or more either: 
(1)  Of the area of the lots or land included in such proposed change; or 
(2)  Of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area of such proposed change and extending 200 feet therefrom. 
c.  Protests signed by property owners may be filed prior to or at one of the public hearings conducted by either the commission or the council. Written protests filed with the commission shall be forwarded to the council with the commission's recommendation on the request. 
D.  Limitation on re-applications. When the city council has denied a proposal no new applications of like nature shall be accepted by the city or scheduled for hearing by the commission within a period of 12 months of the date of council denial. Provided, however, on receipt of written request by the original applicant stating how conditions have changed substantially in the community since prior consideration of his proposal so as to justify an earlier review of this matter, the city council may waive the mandatory delay period and authorize the acceptance of a new application.

1.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. 
2.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any portion of the same lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. 
3.  If any such nonconforming use of land is deemed to be abandoned for any reason for a period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located. 
Sec. 4-6. - Nonconforming buildings. 
    Where a lawful building exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the building, such building may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  No such nonconforming building may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any building or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity or to comply with city building codes. 
2.  Should such nonconforming building or nonconforming portion of a building be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, or 50 percent of the area of the structure, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, or when approved by the board of adjustment, after public hearing thereon, when the board's findings, having due regard for the property rights of persons affected, were considered in the light of public welfare and the character of the area surrounding the nonconforming building and the conservation and protection of property. 
3.  Should such building be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
4.  Structures existing prior to the effective date of this ordinance, which were conforming at that time, are exempt from the exterior masonry requirement contained in article 6, Zoning District. 
5.  Enclosed garage exemption. All existing residential units existing at the effective date of this ordinance, which are located in the Carport Overlay District, shall be exempt from the requirement to have two enclosed parking spaces. 
(Ord. No. 2003-03, § 1, 4-1-03; Ord. No. 2003-14, § 1, 12-2-03) 
Sec. 4-7. - Nonconforming uses of buildings. 
    If lawful use involving individual buildings exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that would not be allowed in a particular district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  No existing building devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the building to a use permitted in the district in which it is located, or to comply with city building codes. 
2.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
3.  If no structural alterations are made, except as required by the city's building codes, any nonconforming use of a building, or building and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the board of adjustment, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the board of adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this ordinance. 
4.  Any building in which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
5.  When a nonconforming use of a building is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months, the building shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
6.  Where nonconforming use status applied to a building and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the building shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction. 
7.  Where nonconforming use status applies to a conforming building, such use shall be immediately terminated upon transfer to another ownership or lease. 
Sec. 4-8. - Repairs and maintenance. 
    On any nonconforming building or portion of a building containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming building or nonconforming portion of the building, as the case may be; provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
    If a nonconforming building or portion of a building containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized city official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt, except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
    Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
Sec. 4-9. - Nonconforming uses discontinued. 
    A nonconforming use of any building or structure which has been discontinued shall not thereafter be returned to any nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be considered discontinued when: 
1.  It has been replaced with a conforming use; or 
2.  Such building or structure is or hereafter becomes vacant and remains unoccupied or out of use for a continuous period of six months, or the equipment and furnishings of the nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced within such six-month period; or 
3.  The intention of the owner to permanently discontinue the use is apparent. 
Sec. 4-10. - Changes that lessen nonconformity. 
    Changing to a more restricted or less intensive nonconforming use that lessens the extent of the original nonconformity may be permitted by the board of adjustment. 
Sec. 4-11. - Registration of nonconforming uses and structures. 
A.  Time limitation for registration. The operator, owner, or owners of all nonconforming uses of land or structures shall, within six months of the effective date of this ordinance, register such nonconforming use with the building official. The building official shall issue a temporary certificate of occupancy which shall state specifically wherein the nonconforming use or structure differs from the provisions of this ordinance and the date upon which the temporary certificate of occupancy shall expire. 
B.  Failure to register. Uses and structure not registered within 24 months of the effective date of this ordinance shall be required to conform totally to this ordinance prior to issuance of a building permit, or certificate of occupancy in the future. 
C.  Application for extension of period of nonconformity. In order to allow recoupment of investment, within six months of the effective date of this ordinance, an owner of land upon which a nonconforming use or structure is maintained may request an extension of the period of nonconformity beyond the time limits set forth in section 4-12 of this ordinance. Such request shall be filed with the building official and shall be heard by the board of adjustment. No investments made after the effective date of this ordinance may be considered as recoupable investment. The applicant shall supply such information as is requested by the building official or the board of adjustment. The board may continue any hearing on an application in order to study the matters pertaining to the application in order to fairly determine whether an extension of time is reasonable and necessary and to achieve the intent and purposes of this ordinance to require premises to conform to the regulations prescribed herein. 
Sec. 4-12. - Amortization schedule. 
    It is the declared purpose of this ordinance that nonconforming uses be eventually discontinued and the use of the premises be required to conform to the regulations prescribed herein, having due regard for the investment in such nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses shall be discontinued in the following manner unless the board of adjustment has granted an application for extension of the period of nonconformity: 
A.  Nonconforming uses not conducted within a building. Any nonconforming use not conducted within a building shall be discontinued within two years from the date this ordinance shall become effective. 
B.  Nonconforming uses conducted partially within a building. If a nonconforming use conducted partly within a building and partly without a building is registered within six months of the effective date of this ordinance, such use shall be discontinued within five years from the date this ordinance shall become effective. Such uses not timely registered shall be discontinued within two years from the date this ordinance shall become effective. 
C.  Nonconforming uses conducted wholly within a building. If a nonconforming use conducted wholly within a building is registered within six months of the effective date of this ordinance, such use shall be discontinued within ten years from the date this ordinance shall become effective. Such uses not timely registered shall be discontinued within two years from the date this ordinance shall become effective.

Sec. 5-3. - Classification of new and unlisted uses. 
    It is recognized that new types of land use may develop and forms of land use not anticipated herein may seek to locate in the city. In order to provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use shall be made as follows: 
A.  Administrative official action. The administrative official shall refer the question concerning any new or unlisted use to the planning and zoning commission requesting an interpretation as to the proper zoning classification into which such use should be placed. The use interpretation question shall be determined as to the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity, sales, processing; type of product, storage and the amount and nature thereof (i.e., enclosed or open storage); anticipated employment; transportation requirements; the general degree of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material and vibration likely to be generated, if any; and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer. 
B.  Commission action. The planning and zoning commission shall consider the nature and described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses permitted in the various zoning districts, and determine the zoning district or districts within which such use should be permitted. 
C.  Council action. The planning and zoning commission shall transmit its findings and recommendations to the city council as to the classification proposed for any new or unlisted use. The city council shall approve the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, or make such other determination concerning the classification of such use as appropriate, based upon its findings of fact, and amend this ordinance to reflect said findings and decisions. 
Sec. 5-4. - Specific use permits. 
A.  Purpose. Certain land uses, because of their nature and location, are not appropriate for categorizing into installations, such as colleges and universities, institutions, community facilities, zoos, cemeteries, country clubs, show grounds, drive-in theaters and other unusual land uses not specifically provided for in this chapter. To provide for the proper handling and location of such specific uses, provision is made for amending this chapter to grant a permit for a specific use in a specific location. This procedure for approval of a specific use permit includes a public hearing. The amending ordinance may provide for certain restrictions and standards for operation. The indication that it is possible to grant a specific use permit as noted elsewhere in this ordinance does not constitute a grant of privilege for such use, nor is there any obligation to approve a specific use permit unless it is the finding of the planning and zoning commission and city council that such a special use is compatible with adjacent property use and consistent with the character of the neighborhood. 
B.  Permit required. No special use shall be erected, used, altered, occupied nor shall any person convert any land, building or structure to such a use unless a specific use permit has been issued by the city council. The granting of a specific use permit shall be done in accordance with the provisions for amendment of this zoning ordinance. 
C.  Application procedure. An application for a special permit shall be filed with the administrative official on a form prepared by the city. The application shall be accompanied by the following: 
1.  A completed application form signed by the property owner; 
2.  An application fee as established by the city's latest adopted schedule of fees; 
3.  A certificate stating that all city and school taxes have been paid to date; 
4.  A property description of the area where the specific use permit is proposed to apply; 
5.  A site plan complying with the requirements stated in this section which will become a part of the specific use permit, if approved; and 
6.  Any other material and/or information as may be required by the planning and zoning commission, the city council or the administrative official to fulfill the purpose of this subsection and to ensure that the application is in compliance with the ordinances of the city. 
D.  Site plan information. A site plan shall contain, at a minimum the following information, as provided in section 8-1, Site Plan Requirements: 
E.  Additional information. The following additional information may also be required if deemed appropriate by staff, the planning and zoning commission, or city council. 
1.  Copies of studies or analyses upon which have been based projections for need or demand for the proposed facility. 
2.  Description of the present use, assessed value and actual value of the land affected by the proposed facility. 
3.  Description of the proposed use, anticipated assessed value and supporting documentation. 
4.  A description of any long-term plans or master plan for the future use or development of the property. 
5.  A description of the applicant's ability to obtain needed easements to serve the proposed use. 
6.  A description of any special construction requirements that may be necessary for any construction or development on the subject property. 
7.  A traffic impact analysis prepared by a qualified professional in the field of traffic evaluation and forecasting may be required. 
F.  Council action. The city council may grant such a wavier only upon finding that the information submitted is sufficient to determine that the proposed building, use, structure, development or activity will have an insubstantial impact on the surrounding area and that providing the information required by the submittal requirements is unreasonably burdensome on the applicant. 
G.  Conditions of permit approval. A specific use permit shall not be recommended for approval by the planning and zoning commission unless the commission finds that all of the following conditions have been found to exist: 
1.  The proposed use complies with all the requirements of the zoning district in which the property is located. 
2.  The proposed use as located and configured will contribute to or promote the general welfare and convenience of the city. 
3.  The benefits that the city gains from the proposed use outweigh the loss of or damage to any homes, business, natural resources, agricultural lands, historical or cultural landmarks or sites, wildlife habitats, parks, or natural, scenic, or historical features of significance, and outweigh the personal and economic cost of any disruption to the lives, business and property of individuals affected by the proposed use. 
4.  Adequate utilities, road access, drainage and other necessary supporting facilities have been or shall be provided. 
5.  The design, location and arrangement of all public and private streets, driveways, parking spaces, entrances and exits shall provide for a safe and convenient movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic without adversely affecting the general public or adjacent developments. 
6.  The issuance of the specific use permit does not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of neighboring vacant property. 
7.  The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls and fences are not out of scale with the neighborhood. 
8.  The proposed use will be compatible with and not injurious to the use and enjoyment of neighboring property, nor significantly diminish or impair property values within the vicinity. 
9.  Adequate nuisance prevention measures have been or shall be taken to prevent or control offensive odors, fumes, dust, noise, vibration and visual blight. 
10.  Sufficient on-site lighting is provided for adequate safety of patrons, employees and property, and such lighting is adequately shielded or directed so as not to disturb or adversely affect neighboring properties. 
11.  There is sufficient landscaping and screening to ensure harmony and compatibility with adjacent properties. 
12.  The proposed operation is consistent with the applicant's submitted plans, master plans, projections, or, where inconsistencies exist, the benefits to the community outweigh the costs. 
13.  The proposed use is in accordance with the City of Saginaw Comprehensive Land Use Plan. 
H.  Additional conditions. In authorizing a specific use permit, the planning and zoning commission may recommend, and the city council may impose, additional reasonable conditions necessary to protect the public interest and the welfare of the community. 
I.  Time limit. A specific use permit issued under this division shall become null and void unless construction or use is substantially underway within one year of the granting of the permit, unless an extension of time is approved the city council. 
J.  Revocation of permit. A specific use permit may be revoked or modified, after notice and hearing, for either of the following reasons: 
1.  The permit was obtained or extended by fraud or deception. 
2.  One or more of the conditions imposed by the permit has not been met or has been violated. 
K.  Amendments to specific use permit. The procedure for amending a specific use permit shall be the same as for a new application, provided the administrative official may approve minor variations from the original permit which do not increase density, change traffic patterns, or result in an increase in external impacts on adjacent properties or neighborhoods.

a.  All vehicles which are parked or stored on private property in residential areas are to be on a monolithic concrete paved surface or a surface of contiguous concrete pavers (normally used in paving construction and to be two inches or more in thickness). 
b.  Pavers are not to exceed one-half inch above the surface of the yard in which they are placed to allow them to be properly mowed and trimmed around. 
c.  Vehicles are to be completely resting on such surfaces from the point they leave the public streets to the point upon which they are parked or stored. 
d.  All vehicles which are parked or stored in a required rear yard shall be so placed behind a screening partitions of fencing materials or dense vegetation so as to obscure the vehicle from view from a public street. 
e.  All vehicles shall be so parked in relation to the street and dwelling at right angles and not to extend over any walkway or be closer than eight inches from the back of the curb so they will not obstruct the pedestrian ways. Notwithstanding the foregoing, vehicles parked on residential lots maintaining a primary vehicle entryway in the side yard of the lot, of a length no greater than ten feet, may impede the pedestrian walkway if the vehicle will not fit entirely within the vehicle entryway. 
f.  Any vehicle found in violation of this provision must be made operable or moved to an enclosed building within ten days from the notification of such condition existing. All repeat violations which occur at the same ad-dress shall be subject to immediate penalties and/or fines as allowed by law.

At no time after initial approval of the parking area layout can changes be made in the location and number of provided spaces without approval of the city inspector. 
B.  Special events and other one-time events. "Special event" means a festival, celebration, performance or other such special event which occurs no more frequently than once per year, and which will or should be reasonably anticipated to attract patrons or visitors in such numbers as to exceed the capacity of the permanent parking spaces required and provided under other provisions of this section for the property upon which the special event is to be held. Events which are conducted more frequently than once per year are not considered "special events" under the provisions of this subsection, and the property upon which these events are conducted must conform to the other provisions of this ordinance concerning parking requirements.

3.  Subject to the above requirements, the surface of such parking areas need not be paved or otherwise surfaced as required by the other provisions of this ordinance for permanent parking areas, but it must be suitable for the type and amount of vehicular and pedestrian traffic reasonably anticipated for the special event at issue. 
4.  Upon submittal of the required parking plan to the city, the administrative official shall review it and shall advise the applicants whether any changes or modifications to said plan will be required. The administrative official has the sole discretion to approve or reject, or require modifications to, any parking plan required hereunder. No vehicles may be parked in any location not otherwise allowed under other subsections of this section, in connection with any special event, unless and until the city council has issued a written approval of the parking plan of the special event.

Any non-residential use or facility located outside of the corporate limits of the city that desires to use a parking area within the city must obtain a specific use permit authorizing such parking facility within the city. This requirement may be waived by the city council for such a parking area where the non-residential use or facility is to be developed pursuant to an interlocal agreement that places development controls on the use or facility. The city council may waive the specific requirements set forth in this section when the city council determines that the other conditions and criteria placed on the development are adequate to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

C.  In the recommendation of a variance, the planning and zoning commission shall set out the conditions that it finds necessary or advantageous to the public interest in proposing such variances that will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations. 
D.  Financial hardship to the applicant shall not be deemed sufficient reason to constitute the recommendation of a variance. 
E.  In granting a variance, the council shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable in the public interest. In making the findings herein below required, the council shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of the land involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, the number of persons who will reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of such variance upon traffic conditions and upon the public health, safety, convenience and welfare in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the council finds that all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land; 
2.  That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; 
3.  That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area; and 
4.  That the granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly subdivision of other land in the area in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
F.  Such findings of the council, together with the specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the council meeting at which such variance is granted. Variances may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance so that the public health, safety and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done. Pecuniary hardship to the subdivider, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship. 
G.  The planning and zoning commission, in the recommendation of a variance to the city council, shall submit to them a letter containing all the specific facts and pertinent data upon which such a variance has been based, and such documents shall be entered into the official minutes of the council meeting. The decision of the city council relating to the approval or disapproval of a variance shall be final. 
Sec. 1.12. - Appeals. 
    Any subdivider aggrieved by a finding or action of the city council shall appear by filing written petition in a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days from the date of such finding or action, and not thereafter. 
Sec. 1.13. - Special provisions for enforcement. 
A.  A subdivision plat shall not be filed of record until it has been approved by the planning and zoning commission and the city council and the developer has provided surety that the public improvements will be completed and any such actual recording shall be void unless such approval shall be endorsed on the face of the plat as hereinafter provided. 
B.  No construction work shall begin on the proposed improvements in the proposed subdivision prior to the final plat and final construction plans being approved by the city council. 
C.  No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made to any plat of a subdivision after approval has been given by the city council and endorsed on the plat in writing, unless said change, revisions or modifications is first submitted to and approved by the city council. Minor revisions to the plat that do not revise property line locations, right-of-way lines, etc. (such as minor easement variations, note clarifications, etc.) as determined by the director of public works may be accomplished with only director of public works and city staff approval. 
D.  No building permit shall be issued by the city for any structure on any lot in a subdivision which is not serviceable by the community sanitary sewer collection system, unless a valid septic tank license for the specific lot has first been obtained. The septic tank system must comply with the Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 284, Private Sewage Facilities. 
E.  No building, repair, plumbing or electrical permit shall be issued by the city for any structure on a lot in a subdivision for which a final plat has not been approved and filed for record, nor for any structure on a lot within a subdivision which the standards contained herein or referred to herein have not been complied with in full or in the alternative granted a variance pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. 
F.  The city shall not authorize any other person nor shall the city itself repair, maintain, install or provide any streets or public utility services in any subdivision for which the standards contained herein or referred to herein have not been complied with in full or in the alternative granted a variance pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. 
G.  Disapproval of a plat by the council shall be deemed a refusal by the city to accept the offered dedications shown thereon. Approval of a plat shall not impose any duty upon the city concerning the maintenance or improvement of any such dedicated parts until the proper authorities of the city have actually appropriated the same by entry, use, or improvement. Any such dedication, before or after actual appropriation may be vacated by the council in any manner provided by law. 
H.  The city shall not authorize any other person nor shall the city itself sell or supply any water, gas, electricity, or sanitary sewer service within a subdivision for which a final plat has not been approved or filed for record, nor in which the standards contained herein or referred to herein have not been complied with in full or in the alternative granted a variance pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. 
I.  On behalf of the city, the city attorney shall, when directed by the city council, institute appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this ordinance or the standards referred to herein with respect to any violation thereof which occurs within any area subject to all or a part of the provisions of this ordinance. 
J.  In addition thereto, any abutting owner or lessee or other person prejudicially affected by the violation of the terms of this ordinance may resort to any court of competent jurisdiction for any writ or writs, or to obtain such relief, either in law or equity, as may be deemed advisable in these premises. 
K.  If any subdivision exists for which a final plat has not been approved or in which the standards contained herein or referred to herein have not been complied with in full, the city council may pass a resolution reciting the facts of such non-compliance and failure to secure final plat approval, and reciting the fact that the provisions of this section will apply to the subdivision and the lots therein. The city secretary shall, when directed by the city council, cause a certified copy of such resolution under the corporate seal of the city to be filed in the deed of records of the county in which such subdivision or part thereof lies. If full compliance and final plat approval are secured after the filing of such resolution, the city secretary shall forthwith file an instrument, in the deed of records of such county stating that the provisions of this section no longer apply. 
Sec. 1.14. - Amendment. 
    The city council may from time to time amend this ordinance, in accordance with appropriate procedures provided by law. 
    In order to ensure that the development community has the city's latest design and development criteria, developers and their design professionals are encouraged to register with the city's public works secretary. Registration will allow the city to provide notification of any revisions and updates to the design and development criteria. 
Sec. 1.15. - Improvements required. 
A.  The subdivider shall furnish, install and/or construct the water and sanitary sewer systems and the street and drainage facilities necessary for the proper development of the subdivision. All such facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the design criteria referenced as part of this ordinance, and other standards, specifications, and drawings as may be hereafter adopted, approved by the city council and placed on file in the office of the city secretary. 
B.  Offsite improvements, over sizing of improvements, and compliance with public works facility plans. The city intends that a subdivider or developer be required only to build, construct, dedicate or fund those improvements necessary to address the impact that their development has on the city's infrastructure. A developer is responsible for installing the public works infrastructure located within the boundary of their subdivision. Perimeter streets and offsite improvements may be assessed to a specific subdivision project only to the extent that an individualized factual investigation is undertaken to determine the impact that the development has on that public works facility or system and the development will be required to construct, dedicate or fund its roughly proportional share of the cost of the offsite or adjacent facility based upon its impact on or use of that facility. The city will advise a subdivider of any potential offsite or over sizing requirement that might be generated in conjunction with a proposed subdivision activity. The notice provided by the city will identify the facility or improvement that may require the imposition of this type of exaction and will notify the subdivider that an individualized factual investigation will be undertaken to determine the appropriate share of the cost of such improvement to be levied against the development. At the conclusion of the study, the developer shall be advised in writing of the staff's determination of the exaction assessment to be charged to his or her proposed subdivision to address the proportional impact of that subdivision on the assisted facility or improvement. Any subdivider or developer who disagrees with the proposed assessment established by the city staff may appeal the decision of the staff to the city council stating, therefore, the grounds of his or her objection. The subdivider or developer shall reimburse the city for all costs related to performing the rough proportionality analysis. 
C.  Internal improvements. If a city component plan, such as a master thoroughfare plan, master storm water plan or a master utility plan, identifies a major structure or system moving through the interior of a proposed subdivision, the developer will be required to dedicate, construct, or contribute funds to the construction of these improvements only to the extent that an individualized study of the proposed subdivision establishes the proportion of the planned facility that will be utilized by the subdivision. A subdivider shall be required to dedicate, construct or fund improvements only to the level roughly proportional to the impact that their development has on the facility for which the exaction is being levied. The city staff will advise a developer/subdivider of any proposed exaction for a community facility or system within the perimeter of their subdivision at the commencement of the preliminary plat review process. The individualized fact finding study will be completed and the staff will advise the developer of any proposed exaction to be imposed on the subdivision to support the community facility or system. A developer who disagrees with this proposed assessment shall have the right to appeal this assessment to the city council stating, therefore, the grounds of his or her objection. The subdivider or developer shall reimburse the city for all costs related to performing the rough proportionality analysis. 
D.  Any and all appeals of development exactions imposed under this section shall be made in writing and served upon the city secretary prior to the payment, dedication, contribution or construction of the improvement. The city council shall act on the appeal within 30 days following its submission. Failure to file an appeal prior to constructing, dedicating or funding the exaction shall waive any right to claim later credit or reconsideration of the exaction.

2.  Threshold analysis: All proposed developments are required to submit the city trip generation threshold analysis worksheet, included in appendix F, prepared by a licensed professional engineer in the state with experience in transportation engineering to determine if the development is expected to generate: 
a.  One thousand or more vehicle trips per day, or 
b.  One hundred or more vehicle trips in the peak direction (i.e. inbound or outbound) during the site's peak traffic hour (typically a.m., p.m., or Saturday peak). 
Unless approved otherwise, trip generation rates shall be based on the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. 
If the proposed development exceeds one or more of the above criteria, a traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be required to be submitted with the preliminary plat in accordance with the requirements detailed in the following section. If none of the above criteria are exceeded, the threshold analysis shall be submitted with the preliminary plat for verification. The city reserves the right to require a TIA for developments that do not exceed the threshold analysis requirements, but may impact a sensitive area or issue, or where there may be a known public concern. 
3.  Traffic impact analysis (TIA): 
a.  Requirements. Prior to the commencement of a TIA, an initial discussion with the city engineer is required to establish the requirements and scope related to the TIA. The city engineer will provide guidance regarding the following: 
 Peak periods for analysis (typically a.m., p.m., or Saturday peaks); 
 Time periods for analysis (typically existing year, opening year of major phase(s), and buildout year); 
 Intersections for analysis (typically all site access drives and all signalized and major unsignalized intersections within 1 / 2 mile of the site); and 
 Background traffic growth rate(s) for horizon year(s) (typically three to five percent per year, compounded annually). 
Depending upon specific site development characteristics, a sight distance analysis, queuing analysis, or turn lane storage analysis may also be required. 
The purpose of the study is to determine whether the existing and planned thoroughfare system can accommodate the impact of the proposed development. If the design level of service cannot be maintained, mitigation improvements shall be required to accommodate the development. To achieve consistency between each study, the following standards shall apply: 
 Design level of service: 
The minimum acceptable level of service (LOS) within the city shall be defined as LOS "C" in the design hour(s) for all study links and intersections. 
LOS "D" may be permitted by the city engineer for interim conditions at locations where LOS "C" cannot be achieved without major capacity improvements. 
 Trip generation: 
The city's standard for trip generation rates shall be those found in the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. 
Alternative trip generation rates may be accepted on a case-by-case basis if the applicant can provide current supporting data substantiating that the development significantly differs from the rates published in the ITE Manual. Approval from the city engineer is required to use alternative rates. 
Trip reductions for pass-by trips and/or internal capture shall not be permitted without the prior approval of the city engineer. 
b.  Methodology. The TIA shall include the general information detailed below. It should be noted that this methodology is not intended to be all inclusive, but should be used as a guideline during TIA preparation. 
 Site location/study area - include a description of the size, general features, and location of the site - including a site plan and map of the study area relative to the surrounding area; 
 Existing zoning and development - include a description of the existing development on the site and any impact it would have based on the proposed development; 
 Proposed development - include a description of the proposed development for the site, land areas, assumed floor area ratios (FAR), and proposed intensities (i.e. square footage, number of units, etc); 
 Thoroughfare system - provide a description, speeds, and map of existing or planned thoroughfares and traffic control devices within the study area; 
 Existing traffic volumes - summarize traffic counts performed for major thoroughfares and intersections within the study area; 
 Projected traffic volumes - summarize assumptions made in determining horizon year(s) background traffic projections for the thoroughfare system; 
 Trip generation - summarize trip generation rates and projected trip generation for the site for applicable peak periods for each horizon year; 
 Trip distribution and assignment - provide summary, tables, and figures to detail the assumptions made in performing trip distribution and traffic assignment - it is recommended that a figure be provided showing distribution and assignment for each site driveway and study intersection; 
 Capacity analysis - identify capacity analysis technique used and provide peak hour capacity analysis at each of the study area links and intersections for existing and horizon year traffic conditions; 
 Evaluation of recommended improvements - detail any recommended improvements required for the study area to accommodate the proposed development and provide additional capacity analysis worksheets where applicable; and 
 Traffic signal evaluations - provide traffic signal warrant analysis where applicable - including the approximate timeframe required for installation; 
In order to present the information listed above, it is recommended that the study include the following exhibits: 
 Vicinity map. 
 Site plan. 
 Existing lane use assignments and traffic control devices. 
 Existing traffic volumes (for each peak period). 
 Projected site traffic distribution percentages. 
 Projected peak hour site traffic volumes (for each peak period). 
 Horizon year(s) lane use assignments and traffic control devices. 
 Projected horizon year(s) traffic volumes (for each peak period). 
 Summary of recommended improvements. 
c.  Preparation and review. The TIA must be prepared and submitted in accordance with all of the guidelines in this ordinance. The TIA shall be prepared and sealed by a licensed professional engineer in the state with experience in transportation engineering. The applicant shall submit three copies of the TIA for review. In addition, all electronic files used as part of the traffic analysis (i.e. Synchro, HCS, etc) shall be provided. 
Additional requirements and/or analysis may be necessary to comply with the guidelines of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) for developments adjacent to TxDOT facilities. It shall be the applicant's responsibility to coordinate TIA requirements and review with TxDOT, if applicable to the proposed development. 
E.  Drainage. 
1.  The preliminary plat shall include topographical information including contour lines on a basis of five-foot intervals in terrain with a slope of five percent or more and on a basis of one foot intervals in terrain with a slope of less than five percent. All elevations shall be on U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey datum or referenced to a city benchmark on the same datum. The datum used shall be specified on the drawing.

City staff and the city engineer shall check the preliminary plat as to its conformity with city design criteria, comprehensive master plan, and submittal requirements. 
B.  The city engineer shall return the preliminary plat, within two weeks of receipt, to the director of public works with suggested modifications, additions or alterations to the streets, drainage, water and sanitary sewer improvements. The city manager shall make the city engineer and city staff suggestions available to the planning and zoning commission and the city council. 
C.  A preliminary plat shall be considered filed for processing when all required elements have been submitted to the city staff. The preliminary plat and the comments, suggestions and recommendations of the city staff shall be presented to the planning and zoning commission within 30 days of their acceptance by the city staff. The comments of the city staff shall advise the planning and zoning commission of the staff determination of whether the preliminary plat, as submitted, is in compliance or non-compliance with the regulations, requirements, design criteria and development standards of the city. The planning and zoning commission shall disapprove the preliminary plat if it is non-compliant with city regulations. The planning and zoning commission shall consider approval of the preliminary plat if it is compliant with city regulations. The planning and zoning commission may grant conditional approval to a preliminary plat if the elements of non-compliance are minor and the developer/applicant agrees to correct the points of non-compliance and bring them into conformity with city requirements prior to submission of a final plat. If the planning and zoning commission disapproves a proposed preliminary plat, it will state the basis upon which disapproval is made. 
D.  It is to be understood that recommending approval of the preliminary plat by the planning and zoning commission does not constitute official acceptance of the proposed subdivision by the city. There shall be no work done in the field on the proposed subdivision until the final plat has been approved (preliminary site grading will be considered on a case by case basis, but only after submittal, approval and installation of an erosion control plan). 
E.  After recommending approval of a preliminary plat by the planning and zoning commission, the same shall be forwarded to the city council for consideration and approval or disapproval. The preliminary plat expires 12 months after city council approval, unless a final plat for the property, consistent in all respects with the approved preliminary plat, has been submitted for approval. 
    If the subdivision is to be constructed in phases, the preliminary plat will remain valid as long as no more than two years time passes between approval of the final plat for a phase and the submittal of the final plat for approval of the subsequent phase and each phase incorporates at least 25 percent (by lot count) of the approved preliminary plat. The preliminary plat may also be extended with city council approval by filing a written request prior to the plat's expiration.

CITY SECRETARY 
17.  City approval of the street address numbering for all houses or other buildings contemplated to be erected within the subdivision as developed, such street address numbering to be assigned by the fire chief prior to the approval of the final plat. 
I.  Storm water management acknowledgment and indemnity. Prior to final plat approval by the city council, the developer of a subdivision and/or re-subdivision of land shall be required to execute and file with the city secretary an acknowledgment agreement and an indemnity agreement relating to the storm water management system and improvements located within the subdivision as set forth below. 
1.  Acknowledgment agreement. The acknowledgment agreement executed by the developer shall be on a form provided by the city and shall establish, as a matter of record, the following matters: 
a.  The city requires that the developer of a subdivision employ a licensed professional engineer in the state to design the storm water management system within the subdivision. The engineer is to evaluate the specific local circumstances of the tract being subdivided and to analyze flows of water entering the tract and leaving the tract subsequent to the development of the subdivision. The engineer is to utilize his or her best professional judgment to design a system that will adequately manage storm water at the specific location in question and to ensure that the system conforms to the requirements of state law. 
b.  The storm water/drainage improvement standards published and approved by the city are the minimum standards deemed acceptable by the city. The city does not and has not represented that they are appropriate for every situation and it is the responsibility of the developer's engineer to determine if a more extensive system is necessary to adequately manage storm water issues both onsite and offsite. 
c.  The city staff of the city will undertake a summary review of the storm water analysis and proposed improvements presented by the developer's engineer. The city staff will not re-engineer the project but will only be reviewing the developer's work to determine if it appears to be consistent with minimum requirements and to meet or exceed minimum specifications contained in city development requirements. The city's engineering review is not intended to evaluate the detailed engineering analysis and calculations undertaken by the developer's engineer. 
2.  Indemnification agreement. The developer shall execute and file with the city secretary a written agreement to indemnify and hold harmless the city from any and all judgments, claims, demands or causes of action of any nature whatsoever occasioned by or arising out of the inadequate or improper surface drainage of said subdivision or re-subdivision for a period of five years from the date of the approval by the city council of the final plat of said subdivision or re-subdivision. The indemnification agreement is required because the developer's engineer has designed the system and the developer's contractors have constructed the system. 
Sec. 5.05. - Construction plans. 
A.  General. 
1.  All improvements shall be designed in accordance with the city design criteria referenced as part of this ordinance.

A.  Once all the requirements of the city have been met, the city engineer shall recommend acceptance of the subdivision in the form of a letter to the director of public works. 
B.  Acceptance by the city shall be in the form of a letter from the city manager or other authorized city official to the developer. The letter must state that inspections were conducted and the facilities were completed in accordance with specifications and standards provided for herein or approved by the city council at the time the final plat was approved for the said subdivision. 
Sec. 6.08. - Issuance of building permits. 
    No building permit, water, sanitary sewer, plumbing or electrical permit or service shall be issued or allowed to a developer, owner or any other person with respect to any property in any subdivision, except for model homes and construction offices, covered by this ordinance until such time as all of the applicable requirements of this Ordinance have been satisfactorily completed and the construction accepted by the city and the final plat is filed with the county. 
ARTICLE 7. - DESIGN CRITERIA 

Sec. 7.01. - General. 
A.  The following design criteria are primarily intended for use by the subdivider's engineer. There may be special circumstances which would dictate requirements in excess of those outlined; however, in most cases, these exceptions will be apparent to the subdivider's engineer while preparing the construction plans and specifications for the subdivision. 
B.  The "Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction, North Central Texas" of the North Central Texas Council of Governments, with all amendments thereto, shall govern and shall constitute the technical specifications for all improvements to be dedicated to the city except as amended by the city construction standards and the city public works department installation guide which is made a part thereof, but is not physically bound within this document. 
C.  No final plat shall be approved by the city council, and no completed improvements shall be accepted by the city, unless and until such improvements conform to the city design criteria and all other applicable standards as prescribed by the city. All improvements, including but not limited to streets, alleys, sidewalks, drainage ways, water and sanitary sewer lines and improvements shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the following design criteria. 
D.  Where appropriate, the city manager, after consultation with the city engineer and director of public works, may in specific cases, and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, authorize special exceptions to the design criteria in order to permit reasonable development and improvement of property where literal enforcement of these requirements would result in an unnecessary hardship. 
Sec. 7.02. - Blocks. 
A.  The length of a block shall be considered to be the distance from property corner to property corner measured along the property line of the block face: 
1.  Of greatest dimension, or 
2.  On which the greatest number of lots face. 
B.  The width of a block shall be considered to be the distance from property corner to property corner measured along the property line of the block face: 
1.  Of least dimension, or 
2.  On which the fewest number of lots face. 
C.  The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
1.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
2.  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; 
3.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic; 
4.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
D.  In general, intersecting streets should be provided at such intervals as to serve traffic adequately and to meet existing streets. Where no existing subdivision controls, the block length should not exceed 1,320 feet. Where no existing subdivision controls, the blocks should not be less than 500 feet in length. However, in cases where physical barriers, property ownership, or individual usage creates conditions where it is appropriate that these standards be varied, the length may be increased or decreased to meet existing conditions, having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of traffic and public safety. 
E.  Where long blocks in the vicinity of a school, park or shopping center are platted, the city council may require a public walkway near the middle of long blocks or opposite a street that terminates between the streets at the ends of the block. If required, the concrete walkway shall not be less than five feet nor more than eight feet in width, through the block from sidewalk to sidewalk, or curb to curb, or if no street, to the property line adjacent to school, park, or shopping center and shall meet barrier free requirements in accordance with ADA and Texas Accessibility Standards. 
F.  All blocks shall be consecutively numbered or lettered in alphabetical order. The blocks in subdivisions bearing the same name shall be numbered or lettered consecutively through the several sections or phases. Lettering for blocks shall be larger and bolder than lot numbers or circled to make identification clear. Any block which is planned as an 'out-parcel' shall be numbered and designated on the plat with notation regarding any development restrictions. 
Sec. 7.03. - Lots. 
A.  Lot design shall provide adequate width, depth, and shape to provide open area, to eliminate overcrowding, and to be appropriate for the location of the subdivision for the type of development and use contemplated, and in accordance with the zoning ordinance of the city. 
B.  Every lot shall have frontage on, and access to, a public street. 
C.  Lot markers shall be iron pins not less than one-half-inch in diameter and no less than 18 long and shall be set flush with the ground at each lot corner. 
D.  All lot corners shall be set prior to the acceptance of the public improvements and shall be marked in a way that is traceable to the responsible registrant or associated employer. 
E.  Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. 
F.  Lots zoned single-family or duplex shall not front upon an arterial thoroughfare and recommended not to front upon a collector, as designated in the comprehensive master plan. 
G.  All side lines of lots shall be at approximately right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines except where a variation to this rule will provide a better street and lot layout. 
H.  No lot shall have less width at the building line than is required by the zoning ordinance. 
I.  Residential lots shall not have direct access onto arterial roadways, and direct access from residential lots shall be permitted on collector roadways only where design conditions do not permit any other possibility. 
J.  Where the area is divided into larger lots than for normal urban building sites, and, in the opinion of the city, any or all of the tracts are susceptible to being re-subdivided, the original subdivision shall be such that the alignment of future street dedications may conform to the general street layout in the surrounding area, and so that the larger tracts may be later subdivided in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance and the minimum standards specified by the zoning ordinance. 
K.  Where a lot in a residential area backs up to a railroad right-of-way, drainage easement, a high-pressure gasoline, oil or gas line, electric transmission lines (69 kv or higher), an arterial thoroughfare, as designated on the comprehensive master plan, an industrial, commercial, or other land use which has a deprecating effect on the residential use of the property, and where no street or alley is provided at the rear of such lot, additional lot depth may be required. 
L.  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from thoroughfares or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. Where lots have double frontage, front building setbacks shall be established in accordance with the zoning ordinance. 
M.  Building lines shall be shown on all lots in the subdivision but shall not be less restrictive than the zoning ordinance. 
N.  All lots shall be consecutively numbered or lettered in alphabetical order. Any lot which is planned as an 'out-parcel' shall be numbered and designated on the plat with notation regarding any development restrictions. 
O.  Any land which, in its natural state, is subject to a 100-year flood or which cannot be properly drained shall not be subdivided, re-subdivided or developed until receipt of evidence that the construction of specific improvements proposed by the developer can be expected to yield a usable building site. Thereafter the planning and zoning commission may recommend approval of the plat; however, construction upon such land shall be prohibited until the final plat and construction plans have been reviewed and approved by the city. 
Sec. 7.04. - Easements. 
    Easements shall be provided on subdivision plats when the following criteria indicate that an easement is required. 
A.  Utility easements. 
1.  Where not adjacent to a public right-of-way, easements at least 16 feet wide for utility construction, service, and maintenance shall be provided where necessary in locations approved by the city. 
2.  Easements at least 20 feet wide for utility construction, service, and maintenance shall be provided for lots which have frontage along state highways. 
3.  Easements of at least ten feet in width shall be provided on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where necessary, for utilities such as electric, telephone, and gas. 
4.  Easements having greater width dimensions may also be required along or across lots where engineering design or special conditions make it necessary for the installation of utilities. 
5.  Easements for sanitary sewer line and water line construction shall be a minimum of 16 feet wide. If the water or sewer line is less than 12 feet deep, the outside diameter of the water or sewer line shall be located a minimum distance of six feet from the edge of the easement. If the water or sewer line is greater than 12 feet deep, the outside diameter of the water or sewer line shall be located a minimum distance of nine feet from the edge of the easement. 
6.  The following statement of restrictions shall be placed in the dedication instrument: 
Utility Easements: 
Any public utility, including the city, shall have the right to move and keep moved all or part of any buildings, fences, trees, shrubs, other growths or improvements which in any way endanger or interfere with the construction, maintenance, or efficiency of its respective systems on any of the easements shown on the plat; and any public utility, including the city, shall have the right at all times of ingress and egress to and from and upon said easements for the purpose of construction, reconstruction, inspection, patrolling, maintaining and adding to or removing all or part of its respective systems without the necessity at any time of procuring the permission of anyone. 
B.  Fire lane easement. Emergency access and fire lane easements shall be provided in locations required by the chief of the city fire department. These easements shall have a minimum width of 24 feet and a minimum height clearance of 14 feet. Any emergency access and fire lane easement more than 100 feet in length shall either connect at each end to a dedicated public street or be provided with a cul-de-sac having a minimum diameter of 100 feet with an additional distance of ten feet on all sides clear of permanent structures. These easements shall be paved in accordance with city design criteria and the city amendments to the uniform fire code and shall be maintained by means of a homeowner's association, the property owner granting the easement, or other means as approved by the city. 
All fire lane locations require the approval of the chief of the city fire department. The minimum construction requirements for fire lanes shall be class A (3,000 psi) concrete, six inches in depth, utilizing #3 reinforcing steel located on 18-inch centers each way. Construction plans shall show the locations of all required fire lanes and shall include the note, "Fire lanes shall be marked by painted lines of red traffic paint 6" in width with the words "NO PARKING FIRE LANE" in 4" white letters at 25' intervals on the red border markings along both sides of the fire lane." 
C.  Public open space easement. 
1.  A triangular public open space easement (POSE) is required on corner lots at the intersection of two streets in accordance with the table below. A 15-foot × 15-foot triangular public open space easement is required on corner lots at the intersection of an alley and a street. 
Type 1 POSE: 20-ft. × 20-ft.

The minimum POSE required above may need to be increased in order to meet AASHTO sight distance requirements. 
2.  The following statement of restrictions shall be placed in the dedication instrument or on the face of the plat: 
Public Open Space Restriction: 
No structure, object, or plant of any type may obstruct vision from a height of thirty (30) inches to a height of ten (10) feet above the top of the curb, including, but not limited to buildings, fences, walks, signs, trees, shrubs, cars, trucks, etc., in the public open space easements as shown on the plat. These open space easements will remain in effect until vacated by ordinance adopted by the city council and the property replatted. 
3.  The preceding public open space easement restrictions may be altered to permit, on commercially zoned lots, the placement within the easement area of: 
One single pole sign with said pole not to exceed 14 inches in diameter and with every portion of said sign allowing a minimum height clearance between it and the ground of ten feet. 
D.  Drainage easements. 
1.  Easements for storm drainage facilities shall be provided at locations containing proposed or existing drainageways. 
2.  Storm drainage easements of 16 feet minimum width shall be provided for existing and proposed enclosed drainage systems. Easements shall be centered on the systems. Larger easements, where necessary, shall be provided as directed by the city engineer. 
3.  Storm drainage easements shall be provided for emergency overflow drainageways of sufficient width to contain within the easement storm water resulting from a 100-year frequency storm less the amount of storm water carried in an enclosed system of a capacity required by the city. 
4.  No construction or filling without the written approval of the city shall be allowed within a drainage easement, and then only after detailed engineering plans and studies show that no flooding will result, that no obstruction to the natural flow of water will result, and subject to all owners of the property affected by such construction becoming a party to the request. Where construction is permitted, all finished floor elevations shall be a minimum of one foot above the 100-year fully-developed water surface elevation based on the ultimate Land Use and must be in accordance with FEMA and TCEQ requirements. Finished floors adjacent to floodplains must also be a minimum one foot above the 100-year fully developed floodplain water surface elevation. 
5.  The following statement of restrictions shall be placed in the dedication instrument of the subdivision plat: 
Drainage Easement Restriction: 
No filling or construction, without the written approval of the city, shall be allowed within a drainage easement, and then only after detailed engineering plans and studies show that no flooding will result, that no obstruction to the natural flow of water will result; and subject to all owners of the property affected by such construction becoming a party to the request. Where construction is permitted, all finished floor elevations shall be a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood elevation based on land use. 
E.  Floodplain easements. 
1.  Floodplain easements shall be provided along natural drainageways and lakes or reservoirs. Floodplain easements shall encompass all areas beneath the water surface elevation of the base flood, plus such additional width as may be required to provide ingress and egress to allow maintenance of the banks and for the protection of adjacent property, as determined and required by the city engineer. 
2.  The following statement of restrictions shall be placed in the dedication instrument of the subdivision plat: 
Floodplain Easement Restriction: 
No construction, without the written approval of the city, shall be allowed within a floodplain easement, and then only after detailed engineering plans and studies show that no flooding will result, that no obstruction to the natural flow of water will result, and subject to all owners of the property affected by such construction becoming a party to the request. Where construction is permitted, all finished floor elevations shall be a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year fully developed flood elevation based on land use. 
3.  Existing creeks, lakes, reservoirs, or drainage channels traversing along or across portions of a subdivision, will remain unimproved at all times and will be maintained by the individual owners of the lot or lots that are traversed by or adjacent to the drainage courses along or across said lots. 
4.  The city will not be responsible for the maintenance and operation of said drainageways or for the control of erosion. 
5.  Each property owner shall keep the natural drainage channels traversing or adjacent to its property clean and free of debris, silt, or any substance which would result in unsanitary conditions. The city shall have the right of ingress and egress for the purpose of inspection and supervision of maintenance work by the property owner to alleviate any undesirable conditions which may occur. 
6.  The natural drainage channel, as in the case of all natural drainage channels, are subject to storm water overflow and natural bank erosion to an extent that cannot be definitively defined. The city shall not be liable for damages of any nature resulting from the occurrence of these natural phenomena, nor resulting from a failure of any structure(s) within the natural drainage channels. The natural drainage channel crossing each lot shall be shown as a floodway easement line on the plat. 
Sec. 7.05. - Erosion control guidelines. 
A.  General. Private property owners, developers, and builders shall be accountable for any erosion of their property or construction site which results in accumulation of sediment in dedicated streets, alleys, waterways, or other private properties. Any accumulation or deposit of soil material beyond the limits of the property or in city streets, alleys, or drainage facilities in an amount sufficient to constitute a threat to public safety and comfort as determined by the city engineer and the director of public works shall constitute a violation of this ordinance. The only exception to this ordinance is for lands under active agricultural use. As soon as construction or modification to the exempted land is to begin so that the use of the land will change from agricultural to any other use, then the land shall lose its exemption and become subject to the provisions of this ordinance. In general, developers, land owners, and contractors are required to adhere to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Phase II General Permitting requirements. These requirements are currently in draft form and will be issued in final form in late 2003. The requirements of the general permit are herein included by reference. All notice of intent (NOI) and notice of termination (NOT) forms shall be filed by the developer with TCEQ. 
B.  Erosion control plan. A responsible party engaging in any land disturbing activity or any construction activity shall prepare an erosion control plan and submit that plan to the city engineer for approval. This article shall apply regardless of whether the responsible party is required to obtain a permit from the city in order to conduct such land disturbing or construction activity. An erosion control plan must be included in the construction plan set issued for permitting. The same erosion control plan must also be part of the storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). No building permits shall be issued until the erosion control plan has been approved. The responsible party shall also be held liable for violations of this ordinance committed by third party engaging in activities related to the responsible party's project. 
C.  Erosion control plan guidelines. 
1.  The city has developed a menu of best management practices (BMPS) to be used during and after construction activities. These guidelines are available for use during the development of an erosion control plan. 
2.  The erosion control plan shall clearly identify all erosion and sediment control measures to be installed and maintained throughout the duration of the project for which that plan is submitted. 
3.  Maximum use shall be made of vegetation to minimize soil loss and natural vegetation shall be retained wherever possible. Where inadequate natural vegetation exists, or where it becomes necessary to remove existing natural vegetation, temporary controls shall be installed promptly to minimize soil loss and ensure that erosion and sedimentation does not occur. 
4.  Vegetation used for ground cover shall be suitable for local soil and weather conditions. Ground cover plants shall comply with the listing from the Texas Agricultural Extension Service for North Central Texas. 
5.  In addition to vegetation, erosion control elements shall be implemented as soon as practical in the development process. The developer may wish to consult with the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) and the TCEQ for a list of BMPs to control site erosion. 
6.  When work areas or material sources are located in or adjacent to live streams, such areas shall be separated from the stream by a dike or other barrier to prevent sediment from entering the flowing stream. Care shall be taken during the construction and removal of such barriers to minimize the sediment transport into the stream. 
7.  Frequent fording of live streams will not be permitted; therefore, temporary bridges or other structures shall be used wherever an appreciable number of stream crossings are necessary. 
8.  Wherever possible during construction, erosion controls shall be used on hillsides to slow drainage flow rate. 
9.  Erosion control devices shall be placed to trap any losses from stockpiled topsoil. 
10.  Runoff shall be diverted away from construction areas as much as possible. 
11.  Stripping of vegetation from project sites shall be phased so as to expose the minimum amount of area to soil erosion for the shortest possible period of time. Phasing shall also consider the varying requirements of an erosion control plan at different stages of construction. 
12.  The selection and timing of the installation of erosion controls shall be based upon weather and seasonal conditions that could make certain controls impractical. 
13.  Should preventative measures fail to function effectively, the applicant shall act immediately to bring the erosion and/or siltation under control by whatever additional means are necessary. 
14.  The responsible party is responsible for maintenance of site erosion control devices until a sufficient vegetation cover has been provided or replaced as determined by the city. Periodic maintenance shall be performed by the responsible party to remove accumulated sediment that would otherwise inhibit the proper functioning of the erosion control devices. Final acceptance is contingent upon having all necessary erosion control measures installed to minimize off-site sediment. A site may be accepted without erosion control measures if perennial vegetative cover is actively growing at the discretion of the city. 
D.  Erosion control requirements. 
1.  In residential subdivisions, the city requires that silt fence be placed along all roadway right-of-way lines and that curlex erosion control blanket be placed behind all curbing within the subdivision (at a minimum). These erosion control measures shall remain in place and be maintained by the responsible party until the individual lots have been developed and permanent vegetative cover has been established as determined by the city. Only then may these erosion control measures be removed in front of these developed lots only. 
2.  The city will inspect the erosion control devices located at a site (residential or non-residential) for compliance with the approved erosion control plan submitted. If a responsible party fails to implement or maintain erosion control devices as specified in the approved erosion control plan, the city shall provide notice on noncompliance identifying the nature of such noncompliance. The responsible party shall have 24 hours to bring the erosion control devices into compliance with the approved erosion control plan for the site where the violation occurred. Modifications to the approved erosion control plan may be required to maintain all sediment on-site. Correction shall include sediment clean-up, erosion control device repair, erosion control device maintenance, and/or installation of additional erosion control devices to prevent reoccurrence of the violation. This 24-hour cure period may be extended for inclement weather or other factors at the discretion of the city. 
3.  At the end of the 24-hour cure period, the city will re-inspect the site. If at the time of such re-inspection, the erosion control devices at the site have not been brought into compliance with the approved erosion control plan, the city may issue a stop work order. A stop work order will be issued for violations of this ordinance including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Conducting any land disturbing or construction activity without an approved erosion control plan for the location where the violation occurred. 
b.  Failing to install erosion control devices or to maintain erosion control devices throughout the duration of land disturbing activities, in compliance with the approved erosion control plan for the location where the violation occurred. 
c.  Failing to remove off-site sedimentation that is a direct result of land disturbing activities where such off-site sedimentation results from the failure to implement or maintain erosion control devices as specified in an approved erosion control plan for the location where the violation occurred. 
d.  Allowing sediment-laden water resulting from below ground installations to flow from a site without being treated through an erosion control device. 
e.  Failing to repair damage to existing erosion control devices, including replacement of existing grass or sod. 
E.  TCEQ phase II permitting requirements. TCEQ is planning to issue a general permit for storm water discharges from construction sites. Construction projects which disturb one acre or more must obtain a permit for storm water discharges from the site. 
    To obtain coverage under the general permit, a NOI must be forwarded to EPA at the address on the NOI form. The NOI form can be obtained at the TCEQ website. The NOI must be postmarked two days prior to initiating any construction activities. The NOI must be prepared, signed, and submitted by both the owner of the project and the general contractor. The NOI requires a certification that the storm water discharges will not impact endangered and threatened species. 
    Prior to submittal of the NOI, a SWPPP must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the general permit. The SWPPP includes descriptions of the construction project, construction phasing and schedule, a description of the impact of the project on cultural resources, proposed measures that will be implemented to minimize pollution of storm water runoff, and provisions for conducting inspections to determine the effectiveness of the erosion control measures. The SWPPP is not submitted to TCEQ, but must be retained on site. The SWPPP must be signed by the general contractor and any subcontractors with site control responsibilities. A copy of the NOI or a project description sign must also be posted on site in a visible location. 
    Once the site has been stabilized and vegetation has been reestablished, a notice of termination (NOT) is filed with TCEQ. The NOT form can be obtained at the TCEQ website. 
Sec. 7.06. - Sidewalks. 
A.  At a minimum, sidewalks shall be constructed of class "A" (per Item 303) concrete (reinforced with #3 reinforcing steel at 18-inch centers each way) and shall have a width of not less than four feet and a minimum thickness of four inches. Sidewalks shall be constructed for all lots adjoining dedicated streets, along major thoroughfares where lots do not adjoin the street, across power line easements, and in other areas where pedestrian walkways are necessary. Sidewalk construction may be delayed until development of lots, but must be constructed for each lot prior to completion of any primary structure. In locations not adjacent to lots and across bridges and culverts, the sidewalk shall be constructed with the other improvements to the subdivision. Sidewalks adjacent to screening walls shall be five feet in width and shall abut the wall. 
B.  Routing to clear poles, trees or other obstacles shall be subject to approval by the director of public works. Sidewalks shall be constructed one foot from the property line within the street or thoroughfare right-of-way and shall extend along the street frontage including the side of corner lots and block ends. The plat or construction plans shall show the location of all proposed sidewalks and shall state at what stage of the project they will be constructed. 
C.  All sidewalks shall conform to the latest ADA and Texas Accessibility Standards (TAS) requirements. 
D.  Every new subdivision, or re-subdivision, shall be required to install sidewalks, with appropriate barrier free ramps, within the public street right-of-way. 
E.  Barrier free ramps shall be provided for access across streets per the city standard details. 
F.  Construction plans need to provide detail showing that no street lights, fire hydrants, water valves, manholes, etc. will be in conflict with proposed (or future) barrier free ramp locations. 
Sec. 7.07. - Alleys. 
A.  Alleys serving single family residential and duplex areas shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 20 feet. Alley turnouts shall be paved to the right-of-way of the street that the alley intersects and shall be 12 feet wide at that point. Alleys shall be paved in accordance with city design criteria for a minimum width of 12 feet exclusive of any curbs which may be required. A uniform transition in alley pavement widths shall be made in a distance of not less than 20 feet. 
B.  Alleys should intersect streets at right angles or radially to curved streets. 
C.  Alleys shall not intersect streets that are designated as arterial or collector roadways in the comprehensive master plan. 
D.  The minimum distance between an alley/street intersection and a street/street intersection shall be the width of at least one lot. 
E.  Private alleys are prohibited. 
F.  Maximum alley length between access points to a street shall be 600 feet. A length of between 600 feet and 1,320 feet without access to a public street may be approved by the city council if it finds unusual conditions or limiting factors. In no case shall an alley length exceed 1,320 feet between street access points. 
G.  Dead-end alleys are prohibited. 
H.  In cases where two alleys intersect or turn a sharp angle, lot corners shall be platted so that a triangular area of 25 feet × 25 feet or greater is dedicated as part of the alley for the purpose of providing a minimum radius of 30 feet to the inside edge of the alley paving. 
I.  Alley paving should have a minimum grade of 0.6 percent and a maximum grade of ten percent. 
J.  Alleys shall be paved with reinforced concrete with a minimum thickness of six inches on eight inches of stabilized base in residential areas and inches concrete on ten inches of stabilized base in all other areas. Concrete shall be class A (per Item 303). 
Sec. 7.08. - Streets. 
A.  Street classification definitions. 
Street Classification Functions-Uses Local Carries traffic from residential areas to collector roadways and interconnects individual lots. Short in length, non-continuous to discourage through traffic. Local streets carry light traffic volumes and trips are of a short duration. Collector Carries traffic from local streets to arterials. Also may serve local facilities such as schools, churches. Uses served would include medium and high density residential, limited commercial facilities, elementary schools, some small offices and as direct access within industrial parks. Collector streets also carry heavy traffic to major commercial and industrial facilities from arterials. Uses would include office parks, industrial parks, and community level commercial facilities. Minor arterial Minor arterial street system should connect and expand the principal arterial system to accommodate trips of moderate length with somewhat lower level of travel mobility and a higher level of land access than a principal arterial system. Principal arterial The main function of the principal arterial is to carry traffic from one urban area to another. The principal arterial system serves the major activity centers of urbanized areas. The principal arterial is used for longer urban trips and carries a high portion of the total traffic with a minimum of mileage.  
B.  General requirements. Any roadway design criteria not addressed in these documents shall conform to the latest edition of AASHTO's Geometric Design of Highways and Streets and the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The following general requirements apply to street improvements: 
1.  Adequate streets shall be provided by the subdivider. The arrangement, character, extent, pavement width, right-of-way width, grade and location of each street shall conform to the comprehensive master plan. Each street shall be considered in its relation to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, significant natural features such as mature trees or water courses, public safety and convenience, and its relationship to the proposed uses of land to be served by such street. 
2.  Whenever a tract to be subdivided abuts any part of any street so designated on the comprehensive master plan, or where a street designated on the comprehensive master plan crosses any part of the tract to be subdivided, such part of the proposed public street shall be designed and platted. The entire right-of-way shall be dedicated, and the street shall be constructed by the subdivider only to the extent required by section 1.15 of this ordinance. The city may participate in the construction cost of any over sizing of roadways required to serve land areas and improvements beyond the subdivision. A rough proportionality analysis shall determine the difference between the cost of the oversized facility and the cost of the facility required to serve the proposed development. 
3.  Additional right-of-way dedication (other than that required along roadways designated on the comprehensive master plan) shall not be required from a previously platted property where: 
a.  The plat of such property is being modified by an amending plat. 
b.  The plat of such property is being modified by a replat. 
(1)  The property is occupied by a building or buildings; and 
(2)  The sole purpose of the replat is to remove previously platted fire lanes, easements, mutual access easements, or delineate the legal boundaries of ownership of the property; and 
(3)  No additional development rights will be conveyed to the property as a result of the replat. 
4.  All streets shall be designed to coordinate with existing streets in adjoining subdivisions. 
5.  Local streets shall intersect with collectors which shall intersect with arterials. Local streets generally shall not intersect with arterials. Connection shall only be permitted where design conditions do not permit any other possibility. 
6.  Streets shall be named to provide continuity with existing streets. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or cause confusion with the names of existing streets. All street names shall be approved by the planning and zoning commission upon recommendation of the fire chief. A street which is, or is planned as, a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same name. 
7.  Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into such unsubdivided area. 
8.  Streets should be platted to allow two tiers of lots between streets.

Sec. 7.09. - Drainage and storm sewer. 
A.  General. The purpose of this section is to establish standard principles and practices for the design and construction of storm drainage facilities within the city. The design factors, formulas, graphs, and procedures described in the following pages are intended to serve as guidelines for the design of the storm drainage facilities provided for developments within the city. Responsibility for the actual design remains with the design engineer. Deviation from the requirements of this ordinance must be approved by the city engineer. 
    All materials, installation, and testing shall be in conformance with the city public works department installation guide and the NCTCOG Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction. 
B.  Hydrology. 
1.  Drainage area delineation. The size and shape of each watershed and associated sub-basins (on-site and off-site) shall be determined for each drainage facility. The determination should be based on topographic maps, at a scale of 1" = 200' or greater. Topographic maps with two-foot contours are available from the city engineer in hard copy format (electronic versions are not available). 
When the city topographic information is insufficient, or physical conditions may have changed from those shown on the maps, it may be necessary to supplement the maps with field topographic surveys. The actual conditions at the site should always be verified by a reconnaissance survey. 
Inlet placement should also be taken into account during the delineation of drainage areas. Each proposed inlet shall have an independent drainage area. 
2.  Rainfall. The intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve, included in appendix A, shows anticipated rainfall rates for storm durations from five minutes to 24 hours. This curve has been prepared using the information contained in the U.S. Department of Commerce HYDRO-35 (National Technical Information Service Publication No. PB272-112, June 1977) for storm durations less than 60 minutes. For durations beyond 60 minutes, the information shown was derived from Technical Paper No. 40 (Soil Conservation Service, May 1961). 
3.  Storm frequency. The following guidelines shall be followed to determine the storm frequency to be used to design a storm drainage system. 
DRAINAGE FACILITY DESIGN RECURRENCE INTERVAL Closed storm sewer systems Ten-year with 100-year positive overflow for inlets on grade in streets such that the depth of flow in the street does not exceed the top of curb. For inlets at low points or in a roadway sag, the 100-year flow must be captured within the curb. Culverts and bridges 100-year Concrete-lined channels 100-year Earthen channels 100-year Detention facilities 100-year  
The drainage system shall provide overflow at all low points and identify the overflow path on the plans and on the plat as applicable. The term "positive overflow" means that when the inlets do not function properly or when the design capacity of the conduit is exceeded, the excess flow can be conveyed overland along a grassed or paved course. Normally, this would mean along a street or alley. If not, the excess flow path shall require the dedications of drainage easements on private property. 
4.  Runoff calculations. The selection of method to be used to calculate runoff depends upon the size of the contributing drainage area at the most downstream point of the project. The rational method is acceptable for designing projects with drainage areas of less than 100 acres. A unit hydrograph method is required for projects with larger drainage areas. 
Regardless of the method used, runoff computations shall be based upon fully developed conditions in accordance with the ultimate land use assumption in the current ultimate land use plan for the city. The design engineer shall size drainage facilities by disregarding the detention effects of upstream properties and calculating runoff as if the off-site property was developed without any detention. If an approved regional detention/retention facility is in operation, the design engineer may size downstream drainage facilities based on consideration of the detention effects of the regional facility. 
a.  Procedure for drainage areas less than 100 acres. 
1)  Methodology. The rational method is based on the principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge. Therefore, the duration of the storm used is equivalent to the time of concentration of the basin. 
The formula for calculation of runoff by the rational method is: 
Q = CIA 
Where: Q = the maximum rate of discharge (cfs) 
C = Coefficient of runoff, based on topography, soil, land use, and moisture content of the soil at the time the rainfall producing runoff occurs 
I = Intensity of rainfall for the time period it takes for flow from the most hydraulically distant point of the drainage area to reach the point of design (in/hr) 
A = Drainage area contributing to the runoff at the specified concentration point/outfall (acres) 
2)  Runoff coefficient. The runoff coefficient "C" in the rational method equation is dependent on the character of the soil and the degree and type of development in the drainage area. Normally, as a drainage area develops the amount of runoff increases in proportion to the amount of impervious area. The runoff coefficient shall be based on the ultimate land use as recommended in the current city ultimate land use plan. 
3)  Time of concentration. The time of concentration is the longest time, without interruption of flow by detention devices, for a drop of water to flow from the most hydraulically distant point of the drainage area to the point of concentration (point of design) of the basin. Note that this is not necessarily the point at the longest physical distance from the point of concentration, but the point from which it will take runoff the longest time to reach the concentration point. 
SCS methodology is recommended to determine the time of concentration (T c ). This method separates the flow through the watershed into three regimes: sheet flow, shallow concentrated flow, and open channel flow. 
 Sheet Flow. Sheet flow is flow over plane surfaces. It occurs in the uppermost area of the defined basin. The time of concentration in minutes for sheet flow is determined using the following equation: 
T c SheetFlow = 60 D / V 
where, D = distance along the flow path (feet) 
V = velocity (feet per second) 
T c = time of concentration (minutes) 
The longest flowpath for the water is determined for each basin begins at the most hydraulically distant point in the basin and ends at the concentration point for the basin. The sheet flow length is then measured along this flowpath from the uppermost part of the basin for a length no more than 300 feet (at a maximum distance of 300 feet, sheet flow typically changes to shallow concentrated flow). 
A slope should be estimated along this length of flow. A velocity corresponding to this slope was determined using the upland method graph found in appendix A. 
 Shallow concentrated flow. Shallow concentrated flow typically begins where sheet flow ends. A projected slope should be established along the flowline for the shallow concentrated flow length. A velocity corresponding to this slope is determined from the shallow concentrated flow graph in appendix A. The time of concentration in minutes for shallow concentrated flow is determined by the following equation: 
T c ShallowConcentratedFlow = 60 D / V 
where, D = distance along the flow path (feet) 
V = velocity (feet per second) 
T c = time of concentration (minutes) 
 Open channel flow. Open channel flow is applicable for large channel sections (and closed storm sewers in some cases). In most cases, it is not applicable for the rational method (since large channels indicate large watersheds where a unit hydrograph method is applied in the city). The time of concentration for open channel flow is determined using the following equations: 
T c ChannelFlow = 60 D / V 
where, D = distance along the flow path (feet) 
V = velocity (feet per second) 
T c = time of concentration (minutes) 
Where V is estimated using a combination of the continuity equation and Manning's equation: 
V = 1.486/n (R) 2/3 (S) 1/2 
where, n = Manning's "n" 
R = A/P = hydraulic radius (feet) 
A = area (square feet) 
P = wetted perimeter (feet) 
S = slope (ft/ft) 
 Resulting time of concentration. The time of concentration is the sum of the sheet flow, shallow flow, and open channel flow segments. 
T c = T c SheetFlow + T c ShallowConcentratedFlow + T c ChannelFlow 
 Resulting time of concentration of inlets. When designing inlets and laterals, the time of concentration is equal to the inlet time. The design engineer shall compare the specified inlet times in the table below to the actual calculated inlet time by computing the flow time overland and along the gutter to the first inlet. In no case shall a shorter inlet time or time of concentration be used than the times specified in the table below. 
The following table includes the values for coefficient of runoff and minimum inlet time for different land uses in the city. 
Land Use "C" Minimum Inlet Time (min) Park Areas-No developed land 0.30 15 Developed park sites 0.40 15 Single-family residential 0.55 15 Duplex 0.60 15 Multiple family 0.70 10 Schools 0.70 10 Churches 0.70 10 Neighborhood retail 0.70 10 Neighborhood commercial 0.70 10 Community commercial 0.70 10 Office commercial 0.70 10 Community facilities 0.70 10 Office park 0.70 10 Commercial 0.85 10 Light industrial 0.85 10 Heavy industrial 0.90 10 Roadway and right-of-way 0.90 10  
 Travel time. The travel time in a conduit or channel from the inlet to the point of design shall be determined through the use of Manning's equation. When attempting to determine offsite fully developed flow for a currently undeveloped area, or single family flow for the proposed on-site detention design, travel time can be estimated by assuming an average flow velocity of six feet per second from the inlet to the point of concentration. 
b.  Procedures for drainage areas greater than 100 acres. 
1)  Methodology. A unit hydrograph method is required for drainage areas in excess of 100 acres. The use of a unit hydrograph calculation will be based upon standard and accepted engineering principles subject to the approval of the city engineer. The recommended unit hydrograph models are HEC-1 or HEC-HMS. 
2)  Rainfall. When using a unit hydrograph method to determine the peak runoff of a basin, a 24-hour storm duration is to be used with a SCS Type II distribution. Rainfall values can be determined using the city IDF curve, found in appendix A. 
3)  Loss rate. To determine the loss rate of the basin, the SCS Curve Number (CN) method shall be used. CN values shall be taken from TR-55 and should in general correspond with the C factors used in the rational method. 
4)  Time of concentration. The time of concentration for use in unit hydrograph applications shall be developed using SCS methods. That methodology is described in the rational method section of this ordinance. 
5)  Routing. The method used for routing of the unit hydrograph through the system depends on the system in question. For artificial channels and storm drainage systems, stream routing can be performed using the Muskingum Cunge method. That method uses the Manning's coefficient, reach length, channel slope, and shape of the channel to determine the storage of the channel reach. 
In ponds and natural channels, the modified puls routing method should be used. The modified puls method uses a stage-storage-discharge method to determine the storage necessary in a channel reach to produce a given discharge. 
C.  Detention. 
1.  Definition. Storm water detention basins are used to temporarily detain storm water, thereby reducing peak discharge rates. Detention basins in the city are required to provide adequate volume and discharge to reduce the 100-year peak discharge rate from newly developed areas one acre or larger to that of a single family development of the same size (C = 0.55) to satisfy the following requirements: compliance with city ordinances, preservation of existing floodplains along major creeks, prevention of overloading inadequate downstream storm drainage facilities, and prevention of erosive conditions in water courses. Either regional detention/retention ponds or onsite detention/retention ponds may be used to provide the required detention. 
2.  Methodology. Basins without upstream regional detention ponds or upstream private detention ponds routed through the site and with drainage areas 100 acres or less can be designed using the modified rational method. Routed unit hydrographs must be used in the design of basins with drainage areas greater than 100 acres or basins where the modified rational method may not be applied. The hydrograph routings through the detention basin are to be done using the modified puls method. 
3.  Criteria. 
a.  The 100-year inflow and allowable outflow will be determined using the methodology described in the "hydrology" section of these standards. 
b.  A maintenance plan, approved by the city engineer and the director of public works, is required for all detention facilities and shall meet the standards given in this section. 
c.  The minimum amount of storage volume of the detention basin shall be that volume required to reduce the 100-year runoff rate to an equivalent single family rate. In addition, detention basins are required to include one foot of freeboard. 
d.  An emergency spillway or overflow area shall be provided at the maximum 100-year pool level. From the spillway, a conveyance path must be provided to the nearest right-of-way or drainage channel. 
e.  The outflow structure shall discharge flows into natural streams or unlined channels at a non-erosive rate. 
f.  Detention basins shall provide positive drainage throughout the pond with a minimum pond bottom slope of 0.30 percent. The steepest side slope permitted around the detention pond is 5:1. 
g.  The design of detention facilities shall include provisions for collecting and removing sediment deposited after collecting and releasing storm water. 
h.  The city does not assume maintenance for private detention ponds. All detention ponds must be placed in a private drainage easement dedicated on the final plat. Public storm sewer infrastructure draining to or away from a private detention must be placed in a public drainage easement. In cases where a private detention pond will be used by owners platting separate lots, a joint detention agreement must be in place between the property owners and must be accepted by the city prior to the property being final platted. 
i.  Detention is allowed in parking lots. Detention in parking lots may not be deeper than six-inches in depth at any location. The exception to the six-inch depth is a nine-inch maximum in areas designated as truck parking only. Parking spaces inundated by detained storm water may not be counted toward required parking ratios for the development. Warning signs must be placed on the site designating that the area may be inundated in an extreme storm event. 
j.  Detention facilities shall be designed to empty in less than 48 hours, unless it is also serving as a sediment control facility. 
k.  Detention facilities shall not be counted as an erosion control measure unless: 
 The basins are designed to empty a minimum of 24 hours from the storm event, and 
 Adequate sediment storage areas in the basin have been set aside and are maintained. 
l.  The property owner shall maintain all detention facilities. A maintenance plan must be included on the final construction plans outlining these minimum measures: 
 Facilities shall be mowed at least twice a year to control weeds and discourage woody growth. 
 Debris, litter, and accumulated sediment shall be removed from detention facilities at least twice a year. Particular attention should be given to removal of debris, litter, and sediment around outlet structures. 
 Conformance with the maintenance plan as approved by the city engineer is the responsibility of the owner of the detention facility. 
m.  An example of the calculations for sizing a detention pond using the modified rational method can be found in appendix E. 
D.  Hydraulics. 
1.  General requirements. 
a.  Property shall be developed so that the rate of runoff created by the development as it leaves the property does not exceed the rate of runoff that would have been created if the property had been developed as a single family residential property. Detention shall be designed in accordance with the "detention" section of this ordinance. 
b.  Runoff calculations must be based on the proposed lot grading for the development. Runoff contributed from off-site sources must be considered in the calculations. All off-site drainage must be calculated at the proposed ultimate land use (fully developed conditions) according to the current city ultimate land use plan. Each on-site inlet shall have one contributing drainage area. The terms "ultimate" and "fully developed" are interchangeable with respect to the drainage sections of this ordinance. 
c.  All drainage systems must be sized for ultimate conditions without the effects of detention facilities. If an approved regional detention facility is in operation, the design engineer may size drainage facilities based on consideration of the detention effects of the regional facility. 
d.  All drainage systems shall provide for positive overflow at all low points. Positive overflow means that when the inlets do not function properly or when the design capacity of the conduit is exceeded, the excess flow can be conveyed overland. Additional guidelines for positive overflow are included in the "hydrology" section. 
e.  The finished floor (FF) elevation of buildings shall be two feet above the 100-year ultimate water surface elevation (WSEL). 
f.  Cross lot drainage will not be permitted, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. 
2.  Open channel. 
a.  General criteria. 
1)  Open channels may be used instead of enclosed systems when the drainage area of the contributing flow is greater than 100 acres. Open channels shall not be permitted when the drainage area is less than 100 acres. An exception to this guideline is a development draining directly to a receiving creek or open channel. 
2)  Improved open channels shall provide a cross section which reduces all velocities to six feet per second or below for grass-lined channels. 
3)  For channel sections with velocities ranging from six to 15 feet per second, a lined section must be specified for the channel. Lining types such as concrete and gabions may be used upon approval of the city engineer. Channel velocities greater than 15 feet per second will not be permitted. 
4)  The developer/owner shall use low maintenance vegetation for vegetative cover, as approved by the city engineer prior to planting. The selection of materials shall comply with the current ground cover listing for North Central Texas furnished through the Texas Agricultural Extension Service. 
5)  A pilot channel shall be used in open channels and within detention ponds with a bottom width five feet or greater. 
6)  In cases when the property boundary follows the centerline of the channel or incorporates only a portion of the channel cross sections, the developer/owner shall construct all improvements required on their property for the ultimate channel design. If channel lining is required, the developer/owner shall coordinate with adjacent owners in order to construct these features in their entirety at the time of the channel improvements. 
7)  At the discretion of the city engineer, fencing and/or guardrails shall be provided for the benefit of public safety along open channels, creek sections, and detention ponds. 
8)  Flumes and curb cuts are not recommended. Use of curb cuts and flumes may not be within a public drainage easement. Flumes on private property must be designed to limit erosion at the end of the flume. 
b.  Design methodology. 
1)  Major channels or channels where backwater effects occur must be modeled using a standard backwater model. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineer's HEC-RAS model is preferred. Other models may be used that meet FEMA and standard engineering criteria, if approved by the city engineer. 
2)  For collector channels and swales, Manning's equation can be used to determine water surface elevations and velocities, where backwater effects from major channels or creeks are deemed to be negligible. 
c.  Hydraulic design criteria. 
1)  Improved channels must be designed to convey the 100-year ultimate flow within the channel banks with one foot of freeboard. In bends in the channel, the superelevation of the water must be estimated and added to the freeboard of the channel on the outside of the bend. Calculations to determine the superelevation in the channel can be found in appendix B. 
2)  All channels must be designed to have subcritical flow. The maximum allowable Froude number for channel flow is 0.86. The calculation to determine the Froude number in the channel can be found in appendix B. Hydraulic jumps are to be avoided, except at bridges and culverts. When a hydraulic jump is predicted at a bridge or culvert, the channel bottom and side slopes must be protected from erosion with a channel lining. 
3)  The preferred channel shape is a trapezoidal section. Unless shown to be feasible in a soils report sealed by a licensed professional engineer in the state, and approved by the city engineer, improved channels shall have side slopes no steeper than: 
 Five feet horizontal to one foot vertical for earthen, grass-lined side slopes. 
 1.5 feet horizontal to one foot vertical for concrete-lined side slopes. 
4)  All unpaved channels shall have sufficient gradient to avoid ponding in low flow conditions. A minimum slope of 0.40 percent is required for all unpaved channels and swales except those used as part of a wetlands area. A concrete pilot channel shall be included in all improved major earthen channels. 
5)  All channel radii shall be a minimum of three times the top width of flow. If the natural channel radius is smaller than three times the top width, care should be provided in the design to protect any structures from channel migration or flooding. 
3.  Bridges-Design criteria. 
1)  One foot of freeboard is required between the 100-year water surface elevation and the low chord of the bridge. Exceptions to this requirement must be approved by the city engineer in writing. 
2)  The skew of the bridge piers and abutments shall be oriented parallel to the normal or flood direction of flow, resulting in an angle of skew as close to zero degrees as possible. 
3)  Bridges shall be designed using standard methods. If the bridge is located across a major channel or a channel where backwater effects occur, the bridge must be included in the standard backwater model of the channel. If the HEC-2 backwater model is used, the normal bridge option shall be used for bridges without interior piers. The special bridge option shall be used for bridges with interior piers, and for situations where pressure flow and/or weir flow occurs. 
4.  Culverts-Design criteria. 
1)  One foot of freeboard is required between the 100-year water surface elevation and the top of road elevation. Exceptions to this requirement must be approved by the city engineer. Along Business US 287 (Saginaw Boulevard), overtopping of access driveways is allowed, as long as the minimum TxDOT design storm is carried in the driveway culvert without overtopping the driveway. 
2)  Culverts shall be designed in accordance with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) HDS-5 manual. Standard charts from that manual are provided in appendix D. Standards in the city will take precedence over the FHWA manual in cases of conflict. 
3)  The culverts shall be oriented such that the impacts due to the flood and normal flow angles of skew on the structure are minimized. 
4)  Culverts can be designed in supercritical flow for hydraulic efficiency. However, the outlet of the culvert shall be evaluated for erosion concerns, and the hydraulic jump must be forced at the outlet of the culvert, whether by design grades or an energy dissipater. 
5)  The maximum allowable velocity of flow through a culvert shall be 15 feet per second. The maximum allowable discharge velocity for a storm sewer system shall not exceed the permitted velocity of the receiving channel or conduit to prevent erosion. The maximum outfall velocity of a conduit in partial flow shall be computed for partial depth and shall not exceed the maximum permissible velocity of the receiving channel unless controlled by an appropriate energy dissipater (e.g. stilling basins, impact basins, and/or riprap protection). Minimum flow within a culvert during a design event is two feet per second. 
5.  Storm sewer systems. 
a.  Materials. All storm sewer conduits within dedicated public drainage easements or public right-of-way are to be constructed using reinforced concrete pipe. Other materials are not permitted unless prior approval is obtained from the city engineer. 
b.  Storm sewer design. 
1)  Storm frequency. Closed storm sewer systems shall be sized as designated in the "Hydrology" section of these guidelines. 
2)  Velocities and grades in storm sewers. 
 The minimum allowable velocity in a storm sewer conduit shall be 2.5 feet per second. 
 The maximum allowable velocity in a storm sewer conduit is 12.5 feet per second. 
 The maximum allowable discharge velocity for a storm sewer system shall not exceed the permitted velocity of the receiving channel or conduit to prevent erosion. The maximum outfall velocity of a conduit in partial flow shall be computed for partial depth and shall not exceed the maximum permissible velocity of the receiving channel unless controlled by an appropriate energy dissipater (e.g. stilling basins, impact basins, and/or riprap protection). 
 The minimum slopes for various pipe sizes that will maintain the minimum velocity are given in appendix C. 
 A minimum of two feet of separation is required (outside of pipe to outside of pipe) between storm sewer and other public utilities, except as required by TCEQ regulations. Separation closer than two feet requires concrete or steel encasement of the water or sanitary sewer line. 
3)  Hydraulic gradient of storm sewers. 
 The hydraulic grade line (HGL) shall be established for all storm drainage design and included in the profile of the storm sewer. The ten-year and 100-year HGLs must be shown on the profiles of public storm sewer systems. 
 When performing hydraulic analyses for storm drainage system design, the starting HGL elevation shall be based on the following criteria: 
- When the ratio of the drainage area of the receiving creek (at the confluence location) to the drainage area of the system being designed is 15:1 or greater, the ten-year water surface of the receiving creek shall be used as the starting 100-year HGL elevation for HGL calculations. 
- When the ratio of the drainage areas is less than 15:1, the 100-year elevation on the receiving creek shall be used as the starting water surface for design calculations. 
- If a system is discharging into an existing downstream storm drain, the HGL shall be tied into the HGL for the ten-year or 100-year event (as applicable) in the downstream storm drain. It is the design engineer's responsibility to evaluate all data employed in the analysis, including any data used from existing plans or provided by the city. If the existing downstream system is undersized, downstream flooding cannot be increased (this may require additional detention than that required by these guidelines) and the proposed system should be designed to accommodate future downstream drainage improvements. 
 Computation of the hydraulic grade line shall proceed from downstream to upstream in a manner consistent with typical engineering methods. 
 If at any time the storm sewer system enters partial flow, the HGL at the next most upstream structure (wye, manhole, etc.) will begin again at the top of pipe elevation. 
 Friction head loss throughout the system during pressure flow shall be determined by direct application of Manning's Equation. A Manning's 'n' value of 0.013 is to be used for these calculations when concrete storm sewer is used. 
 The design event flow (cfs), velocity (fps), velocity head (ft), and hydraulic slope (ft/ft) for each portion of the storm drainage system in pressure flow is to be shown on the profile of the system. The design event flow, velocity, depth of flow (ft), and flow capacity of the system for each portion of the storm drainage system in partial flow is to be shown on the profile of the system. 
 In addition to friction losses, minor head losses at points of turbulence shall be calculated and included in the computation of the hydraulic gradient. The following minor losses shall be accounted for in the storm sewer system design. Equations to determine these head losses are located in Appendix B. 
- Entrance losses. Entrance losses to a closed storm sewer system from an open channel, pond, or inlet shall be calculated. The resulting hydraulic grade line shall be compared to inlet control conditions for the storm sewer. The higher of the two values shall be used as the controlling upstream hydraulic grade line. 
- Expansion and contraction losses. For locations within the storm sewer system where the flow area available increases or decreases, expansion and contraction head loss shall be calculated. 
- Manhole and bend losses. Head losses associated with manholes used for pipe direction changes and bends in pipes of equal diameter shall be calculated. 
- Junction losses. Head losses associated with wye connections or manholes with branch laterals entering the main line shall be calculated. 
c.  Inlet design. 
1)  Inlet placement. 
 Storm sewer inlets shall be located along paved streets at intervals that do not allow the 100-year storm to exceed the top of curb elevation, and allow the roadway to meet the required lane opening criteria. 
 Inlets shall be generally placed upstream of intersections. A maximum of five cfs will be allowed to cross intersections of residential streets in the 100-year event. However, only one street shall be crossed with surface drainage at any one intersection, and this street shall be the lower classified street. No surface drainage will be permitted to cross a collector or arterial roadway. 
 When an alley intersects a street, inlets shall be placed in the alley to prevent flow from that alley from causing the capacity of the intersecting street to be exceeded. 
 When a driveway (residential or commercial) intersects a street, a maximum of five cfs will be allowed to be discharged into the street. Inlets shall be placed in the driveway whenever flow down that driveway would cause the capacity of the intersecting street to be exceeded. 
2)  Inlet capacity and size. 
 The minimum inlet size shall be five feet. Curb inlets shall be five, ten, 15, and 20 feet in length. No more than 20 feet of inlet shall be placed along a gutter at any one location. 
 The minimum lateral pipe size shall be 18 inches for use with five-foot inlets, 21-inch laterals for use with ten- and 15-foot and drop inlets, and 24-inch laterals for use with 20 foot inlets. Where laterals tie into trunk lines, place the laterals on a 60 degree angle with the trunk line and connect them so that the longitudinal centers intersect. 
 Curb inlets may not be utilized as junction boxes. 
 At sags, the flow into a curb inlet shall be one cfs per linear foot of inlet. 
 Additional inlet sizing equations can be found in appendix B. 
3)  Design. 
 City standard curb inlets are required on all public storm sewer systems. 
 Slotted drains and combination inlets are not allowed unless approval is obtained from the city engineer. 
 Drop (wye) and grate inlets may be used in specific situations with the prior approval of the city engineer. 
 All storm drain inlets shall be sized in accordance with the State of Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation Hydraulic Design Manual Chapter 10 (Storm Drains.) 
d.  Outfall design. 
1)  The flow lines of storm sewer conduits that discharge into open channels shall match the flow line of the channel unless the outfall is submerged beneath the normal water surface elevation or the channel is fully lined. 
2)  Flumes are not permitted to convey discharge to the flow line of earthen creeks. 
3)  Pipes may intersect with major creeks at angles not to exceed 60 degrees. 
4)  Pipes may intersect with minor creeks at angles not to exceed 90 degrees only if the city engineer deems that an angle of intersection greater than 60 degrees will not cause an erosive condition, otherwise the angle may not exceed 60 degrees. 
e.  Access. 
1)  Access points to a storm drain shall be no greater than 600 feet apart in storm drains less than 24 inches in diameter and no greater than 1,200 feet apart in larger conduits. 
2)  Manhole structures shall be rectangular and as specified in the construction details of these standards. 
6.  Roadway drainage. 
a.  Design storm frequencies. Street sections must be designed to contain the 100-year storm event within the curb. 
b.  Permissible spread of water. The spread of water on the roadway shall be limited to prevent the street from losing its effectiveness as a traffic carrier, which is an important concern in the case of emergency vehicles which may not be able to traverse an inundated roadway. The following table lists the allowable encroachment limits. 
Street classification Allowable encroachment (during the 100-yr event) Local Maximum depth of six inches or top of curb. Collector One 12-foot lane must remain open. Arterial One 12-foot lane of traffic in each direction must remain open.  
c.  Calculation of flow depth in gutters. The flow of storm water in curb and gutter sections is classified as open channel flow. As such, the design calculations are based on a modified form of Manning's equation. The modified Manning's equation to determine gutter discharge is included in appendix B. 
d.  Alley flows. 
1)  The flow created by the 100-year storm shall be contained within the limits of pavement of all paved alleys. 
2)  Curbs are required for at least ten-feet on either side of an inlet in an alley. 
3)  Design flow in alleys shall be calculated by using the same equation to calculate gutter flow for a straight crown calculated in two triangular sections. 
E.  Floodplain criteria. 
1.  Development within the fully developed floodplain. 
a.  All development with the 100-year fully developed floodplain shall require the approval of the city engineer. 
b.  The city engineer should be contacted for information on approved floodplain hydraulic models for fully developed watershed conditions for the channels in the city. If a hydraulic model is not available from the city, then it must be provided by the developer of the property. 
c.  Prior to the approval for preliminary grading for proposed development within the 100-year fully developed floodplain, a floodplain study must be submitted to and approved by the city. The floodplain study must show that the proposed alterations to the floodplain will not increase the 100-year fully developed floodplain elevation at any location along the channel. This report must contain the following items: 
1)  Written report describing the project and summarizing the effects of the floodplain study. This narrative should contain tables comparing the pre-and post-project flood elevations. 
2)  A hydraulic model of the existing condition of the floodplain. This model should be produced using the United States Army Corps of Engineers HEC-RAS modeling program. The city will accept any version of HEC-RAS that is accepted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). HEC-2 models are allowable if the effective 100-year fully developed hydraulic model is HEC-2. The cross sections within the modeling must be based on FEMA datum (NGVD 29). 
3)  A hydraulic model of the proposed condition of the floodplain. This model shall take into consideration any changes that are proposed to take place within the floodplain. 
4)  Stream profiles and cross sections generated by the hydraulic modeling software. 
5)  Existing and proposed conditions floodplain work maps. These work maps shall be based on a minimum of two-foot topographic contours. The topographic contours should be based on FEMA vertical datum. The proposed condition floodplain work map must include the proposed grading to take place within the floodplain and the limits of the proposed development within the floodplain. 
6)  If the 100-year fully developed flow is not available from the city, or if the developer wishes to update the 100-year fully developed flow for the channel, the report must document the generation of the fully developed peak flow value. The methodology required to determine these flows is the same as that describe in the "hydrology" section of this ordinance. 
2.  Development within the FEMA floodplain.

d.  If the proposed development is planned to encroach upon the FEMA floodway or includes on-line bridge or culvert construction or modifications, then a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) submittal must be produced and accepted by both the city and FEMA. 
e.  A CLOMR may be required for developments that do not encroach upon the FEMA floodway at the city engineer's discretion. 
f.  If a CLOMR has been required by the city, then the city will not grant a building permit for the subject tract until at a minimum the CLOMR has been approved by the city. 
g.  The CLOMR and LOMR must have properly completed FEMA forms that specify that the city will conduct no maintenance of improvements (except for public streets, bridges, and culverts). 
3.  Floodplain easements. The floodplain, both FEMA and fully developed, shall be dedicated to the city as a drainage easement. For all channelization, the easement shall be at least 20 feet wider than the top of the channel banks, with 15 feet on one side and five feet on the other side with dedicated vehicular access available to public right-of-way.

Capacity of Curb Inlet on Grade 
    To determine the capacity of a curb inlet on grade, first determine the ratio of the flow in the locally depressed gutter section to the total flow in the road.

S w = Gutter cross slope (ft/ft)

Appendix E. - Sample Detention Calculations 
Modified Rational Method to Determine Detention Volume Sample Calculation 
    The following is an example of the calculations of the sizing of a detention pond using the Modified Rational Method: 
GIVEN: A 10-acre site is to be developed for Neighborhood Commercial. The entire site contributes to the drainage area of the proposed detention basin. 
DETERMINE: Maximum release rate and required detention storage. 
SOLUTION: 
1.  Determine the 100-year peak runoff rate for the site in single family conditions. This is the maximum release rate from the site after development. 
2.  Determine inflow hydrograph for storms of various durations in order to determine the maximum volume required with the release rate determined in Step 1. 
Step 1 
Single Family Conditions 
C = 0.55 
T c = 15 minutes 
I 100 = 7.48 in/hr 
A = 10 acres 
Q 100 = 0.55 × 7.48 × 10 = 41.1 cfs (Maximum release rate) 
Step 2 
Ultimate Conditions (Neighborhood Commercial) 
C = 0.70 
T c = 10 minutes 
I 100 = 8.78 
A = 10 acres 
Q 100 = 0.70 × 8.78 × 10 = 61.5 cfs 
Check various duration storms 
15 min I = 7.5 Q = .70 × 7.5 × 10 = 52.5 cfs 20 min I = 6.7 Q = .70 × 6.7 × 10 = 46.9 cfs 30 min I = 5.7 Q = .70 × 5.7 × 10 = 39.9 cfs 40 min I = 5.0 Q = .70 × 5.0 × 10 = 35.0 cfs 50 min I = 4.4 Q = .70 × 4.4 × 10 = 30.8 cfs 60 min I = 3.9 Q = .70 × 3.9 × 10 = 27.3 cfs  
Maximum storage volume is determined by deducting the volume of runoff released during the time of inflow from the total inflow for each duration. 
Inflow = Storm duration × respective peak discharge × 60 sec/min. 
Outflow = Half of the respective inflow duration × control release discharge × 60 sec/min 
15 min storm Inflow 15 × 52.5 × 60 sec/min = 47,250 cf Outflow 0.5 × 25 × 41.1 × 60 sec/min = 30,825 cf Storage = 16,425 cf 20 min storm Inflow 20 × 46.9 × 60 sec/min = 56,280 cf Outflow 0.5 × 30 × 41.1 × 60 sec/min = 36,990 cf Storage = 19,290 cf 30 min storm Inflow 30 × 39.9 × 60 sec/min = 71,820 cf Outflow 0.5 × 40 × 41.1 × 60 sec/min = 49,320 cf Storage = 22,500 cf 40 min storm Inflow 40 × 35.0 × 60 sec/min = 84,000 cf Outflow 0.5 × 50 × 41.1 × 60 sec/min = 61,650 cf Storage = 22,350 cf 50 min storm Inflow 50 × 30.8 × 60 sec/min = 92,400 cf Outflow 0.5 × 60 × 41.1 × 60 sec/min = 73,980 cf Storage = 18,420 cf 60 min storm Inflow 60 × 27.3 × 60 sec/min = 98,280 cf Outflow 0.5 × 70 × 41.1 × 60 sec/min = 86,310 cf Storage = 11,970 cf  
The maximum volume required is 22,500 cf at the 30 minute storm duration.

WITNESSETH 
    WHEREAS, the city has requested the state to assume maintenance on state highway routes within such city; and 
    WHEREAS, the Legislature of the State of Texas did enact Senate Bill No. 415, 46th Legislature, effective May 15, 1939, authorizing and empowering the State Highway Commission in its discretion to enter into contracts or agreements with the governing bodies of incorporated cities, towns, and villages relative to the location, relocation, construction, reconstruction, and maintenance, control, supervision, and regulation of state highways within or through the corporate limits of such municipalities; and 
    WHEREAS, the general policy of the state highway commission provides that the State Highway Department may assist in maintenance, control, supervision, and regulation of any or all state highway routes through municipalities with a population of 15,000 or less, and any or all state highway routes except the congested or downtown sections of those municipalities with a population in excess of 15,000 as shown by the last available Federal Census, conditioned that the city will enter into agreements with the state for the purpose of determining the responsibilities of the parties with reference thereto; and 
    WHEREAS, the state highway engineer, acting for, or in behalf of the state highway commission, has made it known to the city that the state will assist the city in the maintenance, control, supervision, and regulation of certain state highway routes within such city, conditioned that the city will enter into agreements with the state for the purpose of determining the responsibilities of the parties thereto; and 
    WHEREAS, all such agreements made with cities, towns, and villages are for the purpose of maintenance, control, supervision and regulation of state highway routes, and shall in no way be considered to cover any present or past obligations either real or anticipated concerning such highway routes through municipalities; 
    NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties hereto to be by them respectively kept and performed, it is agreed that maintenance will be assumed by the state over the specified state highway routes within said city, as set out in the following provisions. 
Coverage. 
1.  State assumption of maintenance under this agreement covers the state highway routes and portions thereof which are listed and described as follows: U.S. 81-287 from the south city limits to the north city limits. FM 156 from the south city limits to the north city limits. 
2.  It is mutually agreed that on the portions of city streets listed below, along which marked highway routes have been located as authorized by the city, the city shall retain full responsibility and control for maintenance, improvement, and regulation; and the state shall not be required or obligated to participate therein, except that the state is hereby authorized and hereby agrees to erect and maintain normal route markers and directional and destination signs for direction of highway traffic thereon. 
3.  In the event the present system of state highway routes within the city is changed by cancellation, modified routing, new routes, or change in the city's corporate limits, the state shall terminate maintenance and this agreement shall become null and void on that portion of the routes which are no longer routes of a state highway; and the full effect and all conditions of this agreement shall apply to the changed routes of the state highways within the city, unless the execution of a new agreement on the changed portion of the routes is requested by either the city or the state. 
General conditions. 
1.  The city hereby agrees and does hereby authorize the state to maintain the state highway routes covered by this agreement in the manner set out herein. 
2.  It is mutually agreed that this agreement shall supplement any existing agreements between the state and the city for the maintenance or construction and maintenance of the highways covered herein and that this agreement shall supersede such existing agreements only in respect to points of conflict. 
3.  The city agrees that traffic regulations, including speed limits, will be established and fixed by agreement with the state after traffic and engineering surveys have been conducted. 
4.  The city agrees to prohibit angle parking, except upon written approval by the state after traffic and engineering surveys have been conducted to determine that the roadway is of sufficient width to permit angle parking without interfering with the free movement of traffic. 
5.  The city agrees to prohibit parking where such restrictions are necessary for satisfactory operation of traffic, by passing ordinances and taking other appropriate action in addition to full compliance with current laws on parking. 
6.  The city agrees that traffic control devices, such as stop and slow signs, traffic signal lights, parking meters, and other types of devices for traffic control, in respect to type of device, points of installation, and necessity will be fixed by agreement with the state after traffic and engineering surveys have been made. The city agrees that it will not install or maintain or permit the installation or maintenance of any type of traffic control device which will affect or influence the utility of the state highway routes without having obtained in writing the prior approval of the state. Traffic control devices installed prior to the date of this agreement are hereby made subject to the terms of this agreement, and the city agrees to the removal of such devices which affect or influence the utility of the state highway routes unless their continued use is approved in writing by the state. It is understood that future traffic signal lights installed as a joint project by the city and state will be the subject of a separate agreement outlining the responsibilities for installation and maintenance. 
7.  It is mutually agreed that, subject to approval by the state, any street lighting system may be installed by the city provided the city shall pay all cost of installation, maintenance and operation except in those installations specifically covered by separate agreements between the city and state. 

State's duties. 
1.  The state agrees to maintain normal route markers and directional and destination signs for direction of highway traffic. 
2.  The state agrees to maintain centerline, lane line, and no-passing barrier line stripes. Any other traffic striping desired by the city may be placed and maintained by the city subject to the approval of the state. 
3.  The state agrees to maintain the pavement, base, and its support, and to maintain the normal shoulders on those sections where there is no curb and gutter. 
City's duties. 
1.  The city agrees to prohibit the movement of loads over state maintained streets which exceed the legal limits for designated state highways for either weight, length, height or width except those having proper permits from the state for such movements. 
2.  The city agrees to prohibit the servicing of vehicles within the normal width of streets and to prohibit signs, except official traffic signs, extending into the streets beyond the curb line, except on any streets and/or portions of streets for which an existing agreement between the state and the city specifies the control of sign location, in which instances those provisions of such agreement covering control of sign location shall remain in full force and effect. 
3.  The city agrees to prevent future encroachments within the right-of-way of the highway routes and assist in removal of any present encroachments if and when requested by the state. 
4.  The city agrees to require installations, repairs, removals or adjustments of publicly or privately owned utilities or services to be performed in accord with state highway department specifications and subject to approval of the state; and further agrees to pay to the state promptly the cost of making repairs to the subgrade or surfacing made necessary by such work on utilities or services.

    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAGINAW, TEXAS: 
    SECTION 1: That the City of Saginaw, Texas, hereinafter called "City," hereby grants to Lone Star Gas Company, a Division of ENSERCH CORPORATION, hereinafter called "Company," its successors and assigns, consent to use and occupy the present and future streets, alleys, highways, public places, public thoroughfares, and grounds of City, hereinafter referred to as "Public Rights-of-Way," for the purpose of laying, maintaining, constructing, protecting, operating, and replacing therein and thereon pipelines and all other appurtenant equipment to deliver, transport, and distribute gas in, out of, and through City for persons, firms, and corporations, including all the general public, and to sell gas to persons, firms, and corporations, including all the general public, within the City corporate limits, as such limits may be amended from time to time during the term of this franchise, said consent being granted for a term ending December 31, 2013. 
    At any time during the term of this franchise, either party may request renegotiation of any item herein. Within a reasonable time following such request, the parties will meet to renegotiate in good faith the suggested amendments to the franchise. 
    SECTION 2: In the opening and refilling of all openings made by the Company, it shall re-lay the pavement and do all other work necessary to complete restoration of the streets, sidewalks or grounds in a condition equal or as good as when disturbed, excluding minor wear and tear, and when Company shall open any grounds of the City for the purposes of laying any gas mains or for any other purpose whatsoever, Company shall open no more space at any time, at any one place nor keep the same open any longer than is reasonably necessary to properly and efficiently execute the work for which the same shall have been opened; and it is especially required that in all cases where work requires the exercise of skill as in laying or relaying pavement or sidewalks, the Company shall employ skilled workmen familiar with the execution of such work. Whenever deemed necessary by the proper authority, the City shall have the right to designate its engineer or persons to supervise a refilling of the Public Rights-of-Way; and the re-laying or refilling of the Public Rights-of-Way so disturbed for the laying of said pipelines shall be at the expense of the Company. All barriers, lights and signs erected by the Company shall be in full compliance with the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Such restoration shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible after the completion of the work and maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the City Manager or his/her designee for one (1) year from the date of the completion of said work, after which time responsibility for the maintenance shall become the duty of the City. No Public Rights-of-Way shall be encumbered by construction, maintenance, or removal, by Company for a longer period than shall be reasonably necessary to properly execute such work. 
    When the Company is required by City to remove or relocate its mains, laterals, and other facilities to accommodate construction of streets and alleys by City, and Company is eligible under federal, state, county, local or other programs for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by Company as a result of such removal or relocation, and such reimbursement is required to be handled through City, Company costs and expenses shall be included in any application by City for reimbursement, if Company submits its cost and expense documentation to City prior to the filing of the application. City shall provide reasonable notice to Company of the deadline for Company to submit documentation of the costs and expenses of such relocation to City. If the Company is required by City to remove or relocate its mains, laterals, or other facilities for any reason other than the construction of streets and alleys or other infrastructure by City, Company shall be entitled to reimbursement from City or others of the cost and expense of such removal or relocation. 
    If City abandons any Public Right-of-Way in which Company has facilities, such abandonment shall be conditioned on Company's right to maintain its use of the former Public Right-of-Way and on the obligation of the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned to reimburse Company for all removal or relocation expenses if Company agrees to the removal or relocation of its facilities following abandonment of the Public Right-of-Way. If the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned requests the Company to remove or relocate its facilities and Company agrees to such removal or relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable time at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation. If relocation cannot practically be made to another Public Right-of-Way, the expense of any right-of-way acquisition shall be considered a relocation expense to be reimbursed by the party requesting the relocation. 
    SECTION 3: In the event of injury to any person or damage to any property by reason of Company's construction, operation, maintenance, or replacement of Company's pipeline system within Public Rights-of-Way, Company shall indemnify and keep harmless City from any and all liability in connection therewith, except to the extent such injury or damage is attributable to City's negligent act or omission. In the event of injury to any person or damage to any property by reason of City's construction, operation, or maintenance of the Public Rights-of-Way and facilities of City within the Public Rights-of-Way, City shall indemnify and keep harmless Company from any and all liability in connection therewith, except to the extent such injury or damage is attributable to Company's negligent act or omission. 
    SECTION 4: In addition to the rates charged for gas supplied, Company may make and enforce reasonable charges, rules and regulations for service rendered in the conduct of its business, including a charge for services rendered in the inauguration of natural gas service. Company may require, before furnishing service, the execution of a contract for such service. Company shall have the right to contract with each customer with reference to the installation of, and payment for, any and all of the gas piping from the connection thereof with the Company's main in the Public Rights-of-Way to and throughout the customer's premises. Company shall own, operate and maintain all service lines, which are defined as the supply lines extending from the Company's main to the customer's meter where gas is measured by Company. The customer shall own, operate, and maintain all yard lines and house piping. Yard lines are defined as the supply lines extending from the point of connection with Company's customer meter to the point of connection with customer's house piping. 
    SECTION 5: Company shall be required to extend distribution mains in any Public Rights-of-Way up to one hundred feet (100') for any one residential customer only if such customer, at a minimum, uses gas for unsupplemented space heating and water heating. Company shall not be required to extend transmission mains in any Public Rights-of-Way within City or to make a tap on any transmission main within City unless Company agrees to such extension by a written agreement between Company and a customer. 
    SECTION 6: Company shall be entitled to require from each and every customer of gas, before gas service is commenced or reinstated, a deposit in an amount calculated pursuant to the Company's Quality of Service Rules as may be in effect during the term of this franchise. Said deposit shall be retained and refunded in accordance with such Quality of Service Rules and shall bear interest, as provided in Section 183.003 of the Texas Utilities Code as it may be amended from time to time. Company shall be entitled to apply said deposit, with accrued interest, to any indebtedness owed Company by the customer making the deposit. 
    SECTION 7: The rights, privileges, and franchises granted by this ordinance are not to be considered exclusive, and City hereby expressly reserves the right to grant, at any time, like privileges, rights, and franchises as it may see fit to any other person or corporation for the purpose of transporting, delivering, distributing, or selling gas to and for City and the inhabitants thereof. 
    SECTION 8: In consideration of the rights and privileges herein granted by City to Company, including expressly, without limitation the right to use the Public Rights of Way of City, Company, its successors and assigns, agrees to pay, and City agrees to accept, on or before the fifteenth day of the second month following the end of the calendar quarter upon which said payment is based during the term hereof, a sum equal to four percent (4%) of the sum of (a) the gross receipts received by Company from the sale of gas through the pipeline system of Company within City to residential and commercial customers within City, (b) the gross receipts received by Company from the transportation of gas through the pipeline system of Company within the City to customers within the City other than industrial customers, and (c) the total cost to the retail customer of gas transported by Company for customers within City other than industrial customers for gas transported through the pipeline system of Company within City, all expressly excluding all gross receipts received from the sale and transportation of gas to governmental users and customers, including State agencies as defined in the Texas Utilities Code. The initial payment hereunder shall be due and payable on or before February 15, 2000, and shall be based upon Company's said gross receipts received during the calendar quarter ended December 31, 1999, and shall be payment for the rights and privileges granted herein for the calendar quarter in which the payment is made. Subsequent payments shall be due and payable quarterly thereafter on or before the fifteenth day of the second month following the end of the calendar quarter upon which said payment is based and shall be payment for the rights and privileges granted hereunder for the said calendar quarter, that is the quarterly payments shall be as follows: 
Payment Due Date Quarter Upon Which Payment Is Based Quarter For Which Payment Is Made Feb. 15 Oct. 1 Dec. 31 Jan. 1 Mar. 31 May 15 Jan. 1 Mar. 31 Apr. 1 June 30 Aug. 15 Apr. 1 June 30 July 1 Sep. 30 Nov. 15 July 1 Sep. 30 Oct. 1 Dec. 31  
The last payment shall be made on November 15, 2013. And it is also expressly agreed that the aforesaid payments shall be in lieu of any and all other and additional occupation taxes, easement, franchise taxes or charges (whether levied as an ad valorem, special, or other character of tax or charge), municipal license, permit, and inspection fees, bonds, street taxes, and street or alley rentals or charges, and all other and additional municipal taxes, charges, levies, fees, and rentals of whatsoever kind and character which City may now impose or hereafter levy and collect from Company or Company's agents, excepting only the usual general or special ad valorem taxes which City is authorized to levy and impose upon real and personal property and special assessments for public improvements. Should City not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing sums of money shall be in lieu of taxes, licenses, fees, street or alley rentals or charges, easement or franchise taxes or charges aforesaid, then City agrees that it will apply so much of said sums of money paid as may be necessary to satisfy Company's obligations, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses, charges, fees, rentals, easement or franchise taxes or charges aforesaid. 
    Each customer (other than governmental, State Agencies, and industrial) of Company transporting gas within the City through the pipeline system of Company within the City shall disclose to Company within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month the total cost of gas transported by Company for such customer during such preceding calendar month. City and Company acknowledge that normal billing practices in the gas industry may cause delays in the disclosure of total cost of gas information by customers. To the extent that such delays prevent the timely disclosure of total cost of gas information to Company from such customers transporting gas, Company shall be permitted to delay payment to the City related to such total cost of gas information until the next regularly scheduled payment. If a customer refuses to disclose to Company the total cost of gas transported by Company for such customer so that the fees provided for herein cannot be accurately calculated and collected from such customer, Company shall utilize a price equal to the index (large packages only) price per MMBtu published for each month in Inside FERC's Gas Market Report in the table titled, "Delivered Spot-Gas Prices," for gas delivered at Houston Ship Channel/Beaumont, Texas, or a mutually agreeable successor publication and index. Such index price for any given month shall be multiplied by the actual volume transported by Company during such month for a customer, and the product thereof shall then be multiplied by the applicable percentage to determine the amount due the City. In no event shall Company be obligated to pay a fee on the total cost of gas transported by Company for a customer if such customer refuses to pay or has not paid such fee to the Company, regardless of the method by which the fee is established. Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to collect such fees. 
    Company agrees that on the same date that payments are made, as provided in this Section 8, it will file with the City Secretary a sworn report showing the aforesaid gross receipts received by the Company during the calendar quarter on which the payment is based. City shall have the right to audit Company's books and records to determine the accuracy of any payments made to City under this franchise. 
    SECTION 9. The failure of the Company to materially comply with the terms of this franchise after due notice and hearing and the providing of an adequate time for the Company to comply with those terms shall entitle the City to compel compliance by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction and if, upon final judgment, not subject to further appeal, being entered in favor of the City, the Company still fails to materially comply with the terms of the franchise and the final judgment, the City may declare this franchise forfeited upon returning to the Company the portion, if any, of the franchise fee paid pursuant to Section 8 hereof that pertains to the period after which this franchise has been declared forfeited. 
    SECTION 10: If Company accepts this franchise as provided in Section 11 hereof, all previous ordinances of City granting franchises for gas delivery purposes that were held by Company shall be automatically canceled and annulled, and shall be of no further force and effect, effective May 1, 1999. 
    SECTION 11: In order to accept this franchise, Company must file with the City Secretary its written acceptance of this franchise ordinance within forty-five days after its final passage and approval by City. If such written acceptance of this franchise ordinance is not filed by Company, the franchise ordinance shall be rendered null and void. 
    SECTION 12: If Company accepts this franchise, by the filing of its written acceptance, this ordinance shall become effective on May 1, 1999, provided that the Company shall begin collecting the fees and charges from its customers within the City as specified in Section 8 hereof effective October 1, 1999, so that the initial payment due hereunder on or before February 15, 2000, will reflect the proper amount as specified in said Section 8.

SECTION 3. USE OF RIGHT-OF-WAY. 
(A)  The grant to Grantee in Section 1 is subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, the Texas Constitution, the City's ordinances, all as amended, and subject to applicable and controlling local, state and federal laws, including the rules and regulations of any and all agencies thereof, whether presently in force or whether enacted or adopted at any time in the future. This franchise agreement shall in no way affect or impair the rights, obligations or remedies of the parties under the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, other state or federal law or the Texas Constitution. Nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver, release or relinquishment of either party's right to contest, appeal, or file suit with respect to any action or decision of the other party, including ordinances adopted by the City, that Grantee believes is in violation of any federal, state, or local law or regulation. 
(B)  Grantee shall provide reasonable notice to the City of planned work within the Public Right-of-Way and shall, except in cases of emergency conditions, obtain a permit if required by the City's ordinances before commencing work. If so required, Grantee shall comply with permitting requirements that do not conflict with this Ordinance; provided however Grantee or contractors working on behalf of Grantee shall not be required to pay fees related to its use of the public right-of-way other than in accordance with Section 7 hereof. 
(C)  The location of all pipes, mains, laterals, and other equipment shall be subject to approval by the City Manager or designee prior to construction; provided however, said approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event of a conflict between the location of the facilities of Grantee and the location of the facilities of City or other utility franchisees within the Public Rights-of-Way that cannot be resolved, the City Manager or designee shall resolve the conflict and determine the location of the respective facilities. Grantee shall not interfere with power, telephone, cable or water facilities, sanitary or storm sewer facilities or other municipal or public use of the Public Right-of-Way. Grantee has the right to request City Council review of any actions concerning Grantee's use of the Public Right-of-Way. City shall provide Grantee with its annual capital improvements plan as well as any updates or changes as soon as the plan, update, or change becomes available. City shall notify Grantee as soon as reasonably possible of any projects that will affect Grantee's facilities located in the Public Rights-of-Way. 
(D)  The Grantee shall construct, maintain and operate its System facilities in a manner which provides reasonable protection against injury or damage to persons or property. 
(E)  When the Grantee is required by City to remove or relocate its mains, laterals, and other facilities to accommodate construction of streets and alleys by City, and Grantee is eligible under Federal, State, County, City or other local agencies or programs for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by Grantee as a result of such removal or relocation, and such reimbursement is required to be handled through City, the City shall include Grantee costs and expenses in an application by City for reimbursement only when the City applies for a grant or program where the eligible relocation costs are delineated separately such that the City has constructive notice that Grantee relocation costs are eligible for reimbursement and only if Grantee submits a request together with its cost and expense documentation to City a reasonable time prior to the filing of the application. City shall provide reasonable notice to Grantee of the deadline for Grantee to submit documentation of the costs and expenses of such relocation to City. In the event that the City makes application for and receives reimbursement for a project where the Grantee's relocation costs and expenses are delineated separately as set forth above and does not provide sufficient notice to Grantee as set forth in this paragraph, the City shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the removal or relocation of Grantee's facilities. In the event that the City receives only a portion of any reimbursement costs sought and the reimbursement received is not delineated separately such that Grantee's eligible relocation costs are clearly noted, the City will reimburse Grantee only after the City's costs have been paid in full. When Grantee is required to remove or relocate any System facility without reimbursement, Grantee shall have the right to seek recovery of relocation costs as provided for in applicable state and/or federal law. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit, alter, or modify in any way the right of Grantee to seek or recover a surcharge from customers for the cost of relocation pursuant to applicable state and/or federal law. City shall not oppose recovery of relocation costs when Grantee is required by City to perform relocation. City shall not require that Grantee document request for reimbursement as a pre-condition to recovery of such relocation costs. Upon receipt of reimbursement from an agency or program as outlined above, the City shall remit to the Grantee, within thirty (30) days of receipt, its portion related to the relocation or removal of its facilities only if the reimbursement received delineates separately Grantee's eligible relocation costs or the City's costs have been paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, City shall not be responsible for reimbursement of any relocation costs if Grantee secures reimbursement of eligible costs from any other source. This paragraph applies exclusively to the Company's recovery of its relocation costs and, except as provided in Section 7(D), nothing herein shall prohibit the City from denying or opposing a request by Company to increase or modify its other rates, charges, fees or tariffs. 
(F)  City may request Grantee to relocate any part of its System facilities installed or maintained in the Public Right-of-Way to accommodate construction or improvement of a highway, road, street, public way or other public work procured by City which is not undertaken primarily for beautification or solely to accommodate a private developer. Grantee shall be responsible for bearing the costs of such relocation to the extent that proposed City facilities are determined to be in conflict with Grantee's existing facilities and as permitted by local, state or federal law. Such relocation shall be made by the Grantee within a reasonable period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days after notice of request from City unless otherwise specifically agreed to by the City or unless Grantee certifies to the City in writing that no conflict exists between its facilities and the proposed City facilities. Should Grantee submit evidence that it is unable to complete the relocation within said time due to no fault of Grantee, the City Manager or designee may agree with Grantee to extend such time. Should Grantee have concerns regarding whether the requested placement of facilities is unsafe or inconsistent with the gas distribution industry standard safe operating practices, Grantee shall provide the City with information detailing and substantiating such concerns and work with City on a solution acceptable to both parties. Should Grantee certify that no conflict exists and it is later determined that Grantee's facilities conflict with proposed City facilities resulting in a delay in the construction of City facilities, Grantee shall reimburse City for all expenses incurred as a result of the delay. Should Grantee agree to relocate any part of its System facilities and fail to perform the relocation causing a delay in the construction of City facilities, Grantee shall reimburse City for all expenses incurred as a result of the delay. 
(G)  Following relocation, Grantee shall repair, according to City specifications, clean up, and restore to the condition it was in before being disturbed, all Public Rights-of-Way disturbed during the construction and repair of its System at its expense. 
(H)  The installation and replacement of any System facilities in Public Right-of-Way by the Grantee shall be subject to inspection and approval by the City. The repair and maintenance of any System Facilities in Public Right-of-way by the Grantee shall be subject to inspection by the City. The Grantee agrees to cooperate fully with the City in conducting the inspection. Such inspections shall be conducted within a reasonable time after completion of the project. The Grantee shall promptly perform reasonable remedial action required by the City pursuant to such an inspection. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the authority to regulate and inspect the Grantee's system for compliance with the provisions of Part 192 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations is hereby reserved to those federal and state authorities having jurisdiction thereunder and nothing herein is intended to confer any such authority to City unless expressly provided under applicable law. 
(I)  The City reserves the right to lay and permit to be laid, power, sewer, Gas, water, and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, and to do and permit to be done, any underground and overhead work that may be deemed necessary or proper by the City in, across, along, over and under any Public Right-of-Way occupied by Grantee, and to change any curb or sidewalk or the grade of any street. 
(J)  If City abandons any Public Rights-of-Way in which Grantee has facilities, such abandonment shall be conditioned on Grantee's right to maintain its use of the former Public Right-of-Way and on the obligation of the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned to reimburse Atmos Energy for all removal or relocation expenses if Grantee agrees to the removal or relocation of its facilities following abandonment of the Public Right-of-Way. If the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned requests Atmos Energy to remove or relocate its facilities and Atmos Energy agrees to such removal or relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable time at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation. If relocation cannot practically be made to another Public Right-of-Way, the expense of any right-of-way acquisition shall be considered a relocation expense to be reimbursed by the party requesting the relocation.

 (2)  Attempt to evade any provision of the Franchise or to practice any fraud or deceit upon the City or its Residents; 
 (3)  Failure to begin or complete Gas facility construction and/or extension as agreed to with the City; 
 (4)  Failure to provide the services set forth in the Franchise; or 
 (5)  Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or negotiation of the Franchise.

(C)  The City may make a written demand that the Grantee comply with any such provision, rule, order, or determination under or pursuant to this Franchise.

After such hearing, the City may determine whether to continue or to terminate the franchise. The final decision of the City Council may be appealed to any court or regulatory authority having jurisdiction. Upon timely appeal by Grantee of the City Council's decision terminating the franchise, the effective date of such termination shall be either when such appeal is withdrawn or a court order upholding the termination becomes final and unappealable, and until the termination becomes effective, the provisions of this franchise shall remain in effect for all purposes. 
(E)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and remedies of City set forth in this section shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies provided by law or in equity. City and Grantee understand and intend that such remedies shall be cumulative to the maximum extent permitted by law and the exercise by City of any one or more of such remedies shall not preclude the exercise by City, at the same or different times, of any other such remedies for the same breach of this agreement.

ARTICLE V. - SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY[6] 
ORDINANCE NO. 91-14 
AN ORDINANCE WHEREBY THE CITY OF SAGINAW, TEXAS, AND SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY AGREE THAT, FOR THE PURPOSE OF OPERATING ITS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS, THE TELEPHONE COMPANY SHALL MAINTAIN AND CONSTRUCT ITS POLES, WIRES, ANCHORS, FIBER, CABLES, MANHOLES, CONDUITS AND OTHER PHYSICAL PLANT AND APPURTENANCES IN, ALONG, ACROSS, ON, OVER, THROUGH, ABOVE AND UNDER ALL PUBLIC STREETS, AVENUES, HIGHWAYS, ALLEYS, SIDEWALKS, BRIDGES OR PUBLIC WAYS IN SAID CITY; PRESCRIBING THE ANNUAL COMPENSATION DUE THE CITY UNDER THIS ORDINANCE; PRESCRIBING THE CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN CONSTRUCTION WORK ON PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR THE TELEPHONE COMPANY'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS; PROVIDING AN INDEMNITY CLAUSE; SPECIFYING GOVERNING LAWS; PROVIDING FOR A RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS UNDER PRIOR ORDINANCES; PROVIDING FOR FUTURE CONTINGENCIES; PROVIDING FOR WRITTEN ACCEPTANCE OF THIS ORDINANCE BY THE TELEPHONE COMPANY; AND PROVIDING FOR A TERM AND AN EFFECTIVE DATE. 
    WHEREAS, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, hereinafter referred to as the telephone company, is now and has been engaged in the telecommunications business in the State of Texas and in furtherance thereof, has erected and maintained certain items of its physical plant in the City of Saginaw, Texas, hereinafter referred to as the city, for many years pursuant to such rights as have been granted it by and under the laws of the State of Texas, and subject to the reasonable exercise of the police powers granted by and under said laws to the city; and 
    WHEREAS, the telephone company has operated its telecommunications business in the city under successive ordinances of the city, the last of which was ordinance number 88-37 adopted December 20, 1988, which provided compensation to the city for the superintendence of that agreement based upon a percentage of gross receipts received by the telephone company from certain local services rendered within the corporate limits of the city; and 
    WHEREAS, it is recognized by the parties that changes in the telecommunications industry, changes in technology, changes in state and federal law, and changes in the accounting practices mandated by the Uniform System of Accounts promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), along with regulatory requirements of the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC), have caused the traditional method of determining the amount of compensation to municipalities to become administratively impractical for telecommunications utilities. In order to resolve these issues in a manner satisfactory to both the city and the telephone company, the city and the telephone company have chosen the method of determining the amount of compensation provided for in this ordinance to eliminate the expense and time related to audits, to achieve administrative simplicity, to provide the city with predictable revenues and an opportunity for growth and to avoid the expense and delays of litigation which could be necessary to resolve any issues in controversy between the parties; and 
    WHEREAS, it is to the mutual advantage of both the city and the telephone company that an agreement should be entered into between the telephone company and the city establishing the conditions under which the telephone company shall maintain and construct its physical plant in the city in the future, NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAGINAW, TEXAS, THAT: 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the renewed franchise agreement with Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, adopted as Ordinance Number 91-14 on December 17, 1991. Section 15 of said ordinance repealed the former franchise agreement with said telephone company adopted as Ordinance 88-37 on December 20, 1988. 

Section 1. - Purpose. 
    Pursuant to the laws of the State of Texas, the city charter and this ordinance, the telephone company has the nonexclusive right and privilege to use the public rights-of-way in the city for the operation of a telecommunications system subject to the restrictions set forth herein. The telephone company may use such rights-of-way for its telecommunications facilities. The telephone company's facilities and transmission media used in or incident to the provision of telecommunications service and to the maintenance of a telecommunications business by the telephone company in the city shall remain as now constructed, subject to such changes as under the conditions prescribed in this ordinance may be considered necessary to the public health and safety by the city in the exercise of its lawful police powers and such changes and extensions as may be considered necessary by the telephone company in the pursuit of its telecommunications business. The terms of this ordinance shall apply throughout the city, and to all operations of the telephone company within the city, and shall include all operations and facilities used in whole or in part in the provision of telecommunications services in newly annexed areas upon the effective date of any annexation. 
Section 2. - Additional authority required. 
    The telephone company is not authorized to provide cable television service in the city under this ordinance, but must first obtain a separate agreement from the city for that purpose, under such terms and conditions as may be required by law. This section does not preclude the telephone company from providing its tariffed services to cable television companies.

(Ord. No. 97-3, § 1, 2-18-97) 
Section 5. - Supervision by city of location of poles and conduits. 
    All poles placed shall be of sound material and reasonably straight, and shall be set so that they will not interfere with the flow of water in any gutter or drain, and so that the same will not unduly interfere with ordinary travel on the streets or sidewalks.

If the city desires pole attachments for electric light or power wires or communications facilities or systems not provided by the telephone company, or if the city desires to place communications facilities or systems not provided by the telephone company in any telephone company duct, then a further separate, noncontingent agreement shall be prerequisite to such attachment(s) or such use of any duct by the city.

The expense of such temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting them, and the telephone company may require payment in advance. The telephone company shall be given not less than 48-hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary rearrangements. 
Section 9. - Tree trimming. 
    The right, license, privilege and permission is hereby granted to the telephone company, its contractors and agents, to trim trees upon and overhanging the streets, avenues, highways, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the aerial wires, fiber or cables of the telephone company, and when so directed by the city, said trimming shall be done under the supervision and direction of the city or of any city official to whom said duties have been or may be delegated. 
Section 10. - Indemnity. 
    The telephone company shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from all costs, expenses, including attorney's fees, and damages to persons or property arising directly or indirectly out of the construction, maintenance or operation of the telephone company's facilities located within the public rights-of-way found to be caused solely by the negligence of the telephone company. This provision is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the telephone company and the city. 
Section 11. - Administration of ordinance. 
(a)  The city may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to this ordinance and the telephone company shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. 
(b)  Copies of petitions, applications, communications and reports submitted by the telephone company to the Federal Communications Commission or the Public Utility Commission of Texas shall be provided to the city upon request. 
(c)  The city may establish, after reasonable notice, such rules and regulations as may be appropriate for the administration of this ordinance and the construction of the telephone company's facilities on city property to the extent permitted by law. 
Section 12. - Compensation to the city. 
(a)  As compensation for the use, occupancy, oversight, supervision and regulation of the city's rights-of-way, and in lieu of and in full compensation for any lawful tax or license or charge or right-of-way permit fee or inspection fee, whether charged to the telephone company or its contractor(s), or any right-of-way easement or street or alley rental or franchise tax or other character of charge for use and occupancy of the rights-of-way within the city, except the usual general ad valorem taxes, special assessments in accordance with state law or sales taxes now or hereafter levied by the city in accordance with state law, the city hereby imposes a charge upon the gross receipts (as hereinafter defined) of the telephone company. The amount of the charge for the first year this ordinance is in effect shall be $48,000.00. In no event shall such charge be less than the above amount for each year this ordinance is in effect, except as provided in the case of disannexation as set forth in subsection 12(e), or as provided in section 16 herein. 
    The telephone company will, according to tariff, bill such charge to the customers billed the customer service charges included within the term "gross receipts," as defined herein. Gross receipts, for purposes of this charge, shall include only customer service charges which meet all four of the following conditions: 
(1)  Such charges are for telephone company services provided within the city. 
(2)  Such charges are billed through the telephone company's customer records information system (CRIS). 
(3)  Such charges are the recurring charges for the local exchange access rate element specified in the telephone company's tariffs filed with the PUC. 
(4)  Such charges are subject to an interstate end user common line (EUCL) charge as imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
    For the second and subsequent years while this ordinance remains in effect, the above charge is subject to adjustment by application of the growth factor set out in subsection 12(c). This adjustment for the growth factor will be made effective as of each anniversary date of this ordinance. 
    The telephone company shall adjust its billings to customers to account for any under-collection or over-collection of the charge due the city. 
(b)  The charge for each year shall be paid in four equal installments on May 31, August 31, November 30 and February 28. In the event of any over- or under-collection from customers at the expiration of this ordinance, the telephone company may make a pro rata one-time credit or charge to the customer billing for affected customers who are billed for a service included within gross receipts, as defined in subsection 12 (a). This will be accomplished within 150 days following the date of expiration of this ordinance. If however, it is impractical to credit any over-collection to customers, then such over-collection shall be paid to the city. 
(c)  The growth factor shall be calculated by dividing the telephone company's revenues within the corporate limits of the city subject to the state telecommunications sales tax (sales tax revenues) applicable to services rendered within the corporate limits of the city for the twelve-month period ending three months prior to the next anniversary date of this ordinance by the sales tax revenues for the twelve-month period ending three months prior to either the initial effective date or the preceding anniversary date of this ordinance as applicable. The growth factor calculated by the method set forth in the preceding sentence, if greater than one, shall be multiplied by the current year's charge to determine the dollar amount of the charge for the next year. If the growth factor calculated above is one or less, the charge for the next year shall be equal to the current year's charge. The telephone company will adjust its customer billing to account for the growth factor calculated above. 
    Stated another way, for example, the Charge and Growth Factor for the first three years of an ordinance shall be calculated as follows: 
Example: Charge and Growth Factor for an Ordinance Effective October 1, 1991. 
Payment year 1 Oct. 1, 1991- 
Sept. 30, 1992 Charge for the first payment year = First year charge Payment year 2 Oct. 1, 1992- 
Sept. 30, 1993 First year charge × growth factor, if any (sales tax revenues for twelve-month period ending three months prior to Oct. 1, 1992 (STR) ° by sales tax revenues for 12-month period ending three months prior to Oct. 1, 1991 (STR)) = Second year charge Payment year 3 Oct. 1, 1993- 
Sept. 30, 1994 Second year charge × growth factor, if any (sales tax revenues for 12-month period ending three months prior to Oct. 1, 1993 (STR) ° by sales tax revenues for 12-month period ending three months prior to Oct. 1, 1992 (STR) = Third year charge  
Once the growth factor calculation is completed, the telephone company will provide the city with the sales tax revenues upon which the growth factor calculation was based. 
    The city agrees to rely upon audits by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts of state telecommunications sales taxes as reported by the telephone company which are performed in compliance with V.T.C.A., Tax Code §§ 151.023 and 151.027 (1982). The growth factor shall be recomputed to reflect any final, nonappealable adjustments made to the telephone company's applicable reports of state telecommunications sales taxes pursuant to audit by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. The charge shall be recalculated using the growth factor recomputed as specified in the preceding sentence, and the recalculated charge shall be used for all future calculations required by this ordinance. Any overpayment or underpayment resulting from such recalculation shall be subtracted from or added to the first installment due the following year. If any overpayment or underpayment shall be due during the final year of this ordinance, then payment shall be made as follows. In the case of overpayment by the telephone company, the city shall pay such overpayment to the telephone company within 150 days following the expiration of this ordinance and, in the, case of underpayment by the telephone company, the telephone company shall pay such underpayment to the city within 150 days following the expiration of this ordinance. 
(d)  Such payments shall not relieve the telephone company from paying all applicable municipally-owned utility service charges. Should the city not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing charge shall be in lieu of the taxes, licenses, charges, rights-of-way permit or inspection fees, rentals, rights-of-way easements or franchise taxes aforesaid, then the city agrees that it will apply so much of such payments as may be necessary to the satisfaction of the telephone company's obligation, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses, charges, rights-of-way permit or inspection fees, rentals, rights-of-way easements or franchise taxes. 
(e)  In the event that either (1) territory within the boundaries of the city shall be disannexed and a new incorporated municipality created which includes such territory, or (2) an entire, existing incorporated municipality shall be consolidated or annexed into the city, then notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, the charge shall be adjusted. To accomplish this adjustment, within thirty days following the action effecting a disannexation/annexation as described above, the city shall provide the telephone company with maps of the affected area(s) showing the new boundaries of the city. 
    In the event of an annexation as described above, the charge for the city will be adjusted to include the amount of the payment by the telephone company to the existing incorporated municipality being annexed. In the event that the annexed municipality had no ordinance imposing a charge or in the event of a disannexation, then the adjustment to the charge will be calculated using the effective date of the imposition of local sales taxes as determined by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. The adjustment shall be the percent increase/decrease in the telephone company's gross receipts as defined herein for the city for the first calendar month following the local sales tax effective date compared to the last month prior to such effective date. This adjustment to the charge will be made on the first day of the second month following the local sales tax effective date and the adjusted charge shall be prorated from that date through the remainder of the payment year. The charge as adjusted shall be used for all future calculations required by this ordinance. 
Section 13. - Assignment of ordinance. 
    This ordinance and any rights or privileges hereunder shall not be assignable to any other entity without the express consent of the city. Such consent shall be evidenced by an ordinance which shall fully recite, the terms and conditions, if any, upon which such consent is given. 
Section 14. - Mutual releases. 
    The city hereby fully releases, discharges, settles and compromises any and all claims which the city has made or could have made arising out of or connected with ordinance number 88-37 adopted December 20, 1988, and renewed or extended from time to time thereafter, and its predecessor ordinances, if any, hereinafter referred to collectively as ordinance 88-37. This full and complete release of claims for any matters under ordinance 88-37 shall be for the benefit of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company; its parent; its affiliates; their directors, officers and employees; successors and assigns; and includes any and all claims, actions, causes of action and controversies, presently known or unknown, arising directly or indirectly out of or connected with the telephone company's obligations to the city pursuant to the provisions of ordinance 88-37. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, its parent, its affiliates, successors and assigns hereby fully release, discharge, settle and compromise any and all claims, actions, causes of action or controversies heretofore made or which could have been made, known or unknown, against the city, its officers or its employees, arising out of or connected with any matters under ordinance 88-37. 
    It is the intent of the city and the telephone company to enter into the foregoing mutual releases in order to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both the city and the telephone company. This ordinance and the mutual releases set forth in this section represent a compromise of each party's claims as well as each party's defenses, and is not intended to be and is not an admission of liability or vulnerability by either party to the other with respect to either the claims or the defenses asserted against the other. 
Section 15. - Repeal of conflicting ordinances and agreements. 
    Ordinance number 88-37, adopted December 20, 1988, is hereby repealed; provided, however, such repeal shall take effect at 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the effective date specified in the section of this ordinance entitled "acceptance of agreement and effective date." All other ordinances and agreements and parts of ordinances and agreements in conflict herewith are also repealed, which repeal shall take effect at the time and on the date specified in the preceding sentence. 
Section 16. - Future contingency. 
(a)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this ordinance to the contrary, in the event that (a) this ordinance or any part hereof, (b) any tariff provision by which the telephone company seeks to collect the charge imposed by this ordinance, or (c) any procedure provided in this ordinance, or (d) any compensation due the city under this ordinance, becomes, or is declared or determined by a judicial, administrative or legislative authority exercising its jurisdiction to be excessive, unrecoverable, unenforceable, void, unlawful or otherwise inapplicable, in whole or in part, the telephone company and city shall meet and negotiate a new ordinance that is in compliance with the authority's decision or enactment and, unless explicitly prohibited, the new ordinance shall provide the city with a level of compensation comparable to that set forth in this ordinance provided that such compensation is recoverable by the telephone company in a mutually agreed manner permitted by law for the unexpired portion of the term of this ordinance. 
(b)  Both parties agree that the extension of this ordinance is an interim arrangement and is not intended to be used, and will not be cited or referred to by either party, as evidence of what is in compliance with the requirements of section 3.2555 of the revised PURA. Telephone company and city both hereby reserve all arguments and/or positions as to the appropriate interpretation and application required by the revised PURA. 
(c)  The city agrees to provide written notice to the telephone company of an original application or an agreement thereto, for a consent, franchise or permit with the city for use of the rights-of-way in the city for the provision of any telecommunications service within ten days from receipt of such application. 
(d)  Further, notwithstanding anything contained in this ordinance to the contrary, both city and telephone company agree that either city or telephone company may terminate this ordinance upon a minimum of 30 days notice to the other party on or after the date that (1) any entity applies for an original of, or an amendment to, a consent, franchise or permit with the city for use of the rights-of-way in the city for the provision of any telecommunications service; or (2) any entity with an existing consent, franchise, or permit for use of the rights-of-way in the city files an application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas for a certificate of operating authority which includes any geographic area which is wholly or partially within the corporate limits of the city.

DIVISION 2. - AMENDMENTS AND EXTENSIONS[8] 
ORDINANCE NO. 93-5 
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING THE EXISTING FRANCHISE BETWEEN THE CITY AND TEXAS UTILITIES ELECTRIC COMPANY TO PROVIDE FOR A DIFFERENT CONSIDERATION; EXTENDING THE TERM OF SAID EXISTING FRANCHISE; PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE; PROVIDING FOR ACCEPTANCE BY TEXAS UTILITIES ELECTRIC COMPANY; FINDING AND DETERMINING THAT THE MEETING AT WHICH THIS ORDINANCE IS PASSED IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AS REQUIRED BY LAW. 
    WHEREAS, Texas Utilities Electric Company (hereinafter called "TU Electric") is engaged in the business of providing electric utility service within the city and is using the public streets, alleys, grounds and rights-of-ways within the city for that purpose under the terms of a franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of the city and duly accepted by TU Electric; and 
    WHEREAS, TU Electric has, pursuant to said franchise ordinance, been paying to the city a sum equal to three percent of its gross receipts from the retail sale of electric power and energy within the city for the rights and privileges set forth in said franchise ordinance and, in addition thereto, has reimbursed the city for its ratemaking expenses pursuant to section 24 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act; and 
    WHEREAS, the City and TU Electric desire to amend said franchise ordinance to provide for a different consideration to consist of a sum equal to four percent of its gross receipts from the retail sale of electric power and energy within the city, which different consideration includes, among other things, TU Electric's obligation to reimburse the city for its ratemaking and other regulatory expenses to be incurred by the city involving the regulation of TU Electric; 
    Now, Therefore, 
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAGINAW, TEXAS: 
    SECTION 1. The consideration payable by TU Electric for the rights and privileges granted to TU Electric by the franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of this city and duly accepted by TU Electric is hereby changed to be four percent of its gross receipts from the retail sale of electric power and energy within the corporate limits of the city, said changed percentage to be applied to said gross receipts beginning on June 1, 1993, and being payable as specified in said franchise ordinance and based upon the same time periods as specified in said franchise ordinance and being payment for the said rights and privileges during the period specified in said franchise ordinance, said payment being in lieu of and shall be accepted as payment for all of TU Electric's obligations to pay municipal charges, fees, rentals, pole rentals, wire taxes, inspection fees, easement taxes, franchise taxes, certain regulatory expenses under section 24 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act or any similar or successor law, or other charges and taxes of every kind, except ad valorem taxes, sales and use taxes, and special taxes and assessments for public improvements. 
    SECTION 2. TU Electric shall make a one-time payment hereunder for the purpose of making the changed consideration as specified in section 1 hereof effective on June 1, 1993, without altering the payment dates specified in said franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of this city and duly accepted by TU Electric, said one-time payment being due and payable 30 days after TU Electric's acceptance of this ordinance as provided in section 7 hereof, and being a sum calculated as follows: (a) TU Electric shall determine the monthly average of its gross receipts from the retail sale of electric power and energy within the city during the period upon which the most recent franchise payment made to the city prior to June 1, 1993, was based; (b) the said monthly average of its said gross receipts shall be multiplied by one percent; and (c) the product so calculated shall be multiplied by the number of whole months from June 1, 1993, through the last day of the last month of the period for which the most recent franchise payment made to the city prior to June 1, 1993, was made. 
    SECTION 3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 1 hereof, if TU Electric files general rate cases and the city incurs cumulative expenses, otherwise reimbursable by TU Electric under section 24 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act or similar or successor law, in excess of $4,000,000.00, then in such event, TU Electric shall reimburse all of the expenses incurred by the city in connection with all general rate cases filed during the period ended 15 years from the effective date hereof in excess of said $4,000,000.00 million. The term "general rate case" as used in this section means a rate case initiated by TU Electric in which it seeks to increase its rates charged to a substantial number of its customer classes in the city and elsewhere in its system and in which TU Electric's overall revenues are determined in setting such rates. City agrees to exercise reasonable best efforts, considering the facts and circumstances, to keep its expenses on average to under $1,000,000.00 per general rate case. 
    SECTION 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1 hereof, TU Electric will continue to reimburse the city's ratemaking expenses, if any, in connection with the appeal and any remand of Public Utility Commission of Texas Docket No. 9300 that are otherwise reimbursable under section 24 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act, and will continue to reimburse the city's ratemaking expenses, if any, in connection with Public Utility Commission of Texas Docket No. 11735 that are otherwise reimbursable under section 24 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act to the extent that said ratemaking expenses are incurred through the entry of the last action by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (i.e., the said commission's order overruling the last motion for rehearing) in said Docket No. 11735; the city hereby agrees that any ratemaking expenses incurred in connection with said Docket No. 11735 that the city incurs on appeal of said order will be the city's sole responsibility and further agrees-in the events that the city is a participant in the joint intervention of cities managed by the Steering Committee of TU Electric Service Area Cities intervening in Docket No. 11735, that the city decides to continue to participate with the steering committee in such appeal of said order, and TU Electric is required to reimburse said steering committee for ratemaking expenses under section 24 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act that are incurred on appeal of said order in Docket No. 11735-to reimburse TU Electric the city's share of reimbursable expenses related to said appeal and owed by TU Electric to said steering committee determined by the methodology chosen by the said steering committee (the city to notify TU Electric of the method so chosen by the steering committee prior to the submission of an invoice by the steering committee for the payment by TU Electric of said reimbursable expenses related to said appeal). 
    SECTION 5. The said franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of this city and duly accepted by TU Electric shall not terminate as provided therein, but the initial term of said franchise ordinance is hereby extended for a period of 15 years from and after the date on which said franchise ordinance would have otherwise terminated but for this extension. 
    SECTION 6. In all respects, except as specifically and expressly amended by this ordinance, the said franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of this city and duly accepted by TU Electric shall remain in full force and effect according to its terms. 
    SECTION 7. This ordinance shall take effect from and after its final passage and TU Electric's acceptance. TU Electric shall, within 15 days from the passage of this ordinance, file its written acceptance of this ordinance with the office of the city secretary in substantially the following form:

DIVISION 3. - TIME OF USE RATE SCHEDULES 
ORDINANCE NO. 99-3 [9] 
AN ORDINANCE APPROVING RATE SCHEDULES FOR TEXAS UTILITIES ELECTRIC COMPANY, PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE THEREFOR, PROVIDING CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SUCH RATE SCHEDULES MAY BE CHANGED, MODIFIED, AMENDED OR WITHDRAWN, FINDING AND DETERMINING THAT THE MEETING AT WHICH THIS ORDINANCE IS PASSED IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AS REQUIRED BY LAW. 
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAGINAW, TEXAS: 
    SECTION 1. On January 15, 1999, Texas Utilities Electric Company (hereinafter referred to as "TU Electric") filed with the Governing Body of this municipality a Statement of Intent and Application to implement within the corporate limits of this municipality proposed new rate schedules that provide additional rate options for its customers, which options are entirely voluntary on the part of the customer, namely its proposed Rate GTU-M General Service Time-of-Use-Municipality, proposed Rate RTU1-M Residential Time-of-Use Service-Municipality, and proposed Rate GTUC-M General Service Time-of-Use Voluntary Curtailable-Municipality (said three proposed new rate schedules hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Time-of-Use Rate Schedules"). 
    SECTION 2. The Time-of-Use Rate Schedules are hereby approved, and TU Electric is authorized to render service and to collect charges as specified in the Time-of-Use Rate Schedules from its customers electing to receive electric service under said Time-of-Use Rate Schedules within the corporate limits of this municipality until such time as said rate schedules may be changed, modified, amended or withdrawn with the approval of the Governing Body of this municipality. 
    SECTION 3. The Time-of-Use Rate Schedules herein approved shall be effective from and after the final passage and approval of this Ordinance. 
    SECTION 4. The filing of said Time-of-Use Rate Schedules shall constitute notice to the consumers of electricity within this municipality of the availability and application of such Time-of-Use Rate Schedules. 
    SECTION 5. TU Electric shall not seek any additional rate or surcharge mechanism to recover any revenues lost on account of the application of these time-of-use rates, and there shall be no imputed revenues on account of any reduction in TU Electric's revenues that may result from the application of these time-of-use rates. 
    SECTION 6. The rate reductions approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas in Docket No. 18490 shall be applied to the time-of-use rates approved herein, such that Rider RRD shall be applicable to Rate RTU1-M, Rider GSRD shall be applied to all customers taking secondary service under either Rate GTU-M designated as GTU-M-SEC or under Rate GTUC-M designated as GTUC-M-SEC, and Rider RD shall be applied to all other customers on Rate GTU-M or Rate GTUC-M. 
    SECTION 7. In its next general base rate case in which the time-of-use rates herein approved are at issue, TU Electric will either (a) include all customers taking service under Rate GTUC or GTUC-M during the test year involved in such base rate case as a separate rate class in its cost allocation study, or (b) include in its cost allocation study the load and revenue data applicable to each GTUC or GTUC-M customer taking service under Rate GTUC or GTUC-M during the test year involved in such base rate case with the load and revenue data of the rate class applicable to such GTUC or GTUC-M customer immediately prior to such customer's taking service under Rate GTUC or GTUC-M. In the event, however, that industry restructuring is mandated by legislative changes prior to the time that TU Electric has another general base rate case and such legislation authorizes the recovery by TU Electric of any stranded costs from its various customer classes in accordance with its last approved cost of service study, the customers then receiving service under the time-of-use rates will be included in the customer classes reflected in TU Electric's most recent cost of service study as follows: 
(A)  Customers on Rate RTU1-M shall be included in Rate Class RTU; 
(B)  Customers on Rate GTU-M shall be included in Rate Class HV, GP, or GS, depending upon the voltage level of the service, such that customers on Rate GTU-M receiving service at high voltages shall be included in Rate Class HV, customers receiving service at primary distribution voltages shall be included in Rate Class GP, and customers receiving service at secondary distribution voltages shall be included in Rate Class GS; and 
(C)  Customers on Rate GTUC-M shall be included in Rate Class NI (Noticed Interruptible) depending upon the voltage level of the service, such that customers on Rate GTUC-M receiving service at high voltages shall be included in Rate Class NI (High Voltage), customers on Rate GTUC-M receiving service at primary distribution voltages shall be included in Rate NI (Primary), and Customers on Rate GTUC-M receiving service at secondary distribution voltages shall be included in Rate NI (Secondary). 
    SECTION 8. Nothing in this Ordinance contained shall be construed now or hereafter as limiting or modifying in any manner the right and power of the Governing Body of this municipality under the law to regulate the rates, operations, and services of TU Electric. 
    SECTION 9. It is hereby officially found and determined that the meeting at which this Ordinance is passed is open to the public and as required by law and that public notice of the time, place, and purpose of said meeting was given as required. 
PASSED AND APPROVED at a Regular Meeting of the City Council of the City of Saginaw, Texas, on this the 16th day of February, 1999.

The provisions set forth in this ordinance represent the terms and conditions under which Company shall construct, operate, and maintain its system facilities within the Public Rights-of-Way of the City. Company, by its acceptance of this Franchise, agrees that all such lawful regulatory powers and rights as the same may be from time to time vested in the City shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the City at any time. The grant to Company in this Franchise is subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, PURA, the Texas Constitution, and the City's Code of Ordinances (unless the City's Ordinances are otherwise in conflict with any federal or state laws, rules, or regulations, or this Franchise), all of which may be amended from time to time, and subject to all other applicable and controlling local, state and federal laws, including the rules and regulations of any and all agencies thereof, whether presently in force or whether enacted or adopted at any time in the future. This franchise agreement shall in no way affect or impair the rights, obligations or remedies of the parties under PURA, or under other state or federal laws, rules or regulations. Nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver, release or relinquishment of either party's right to contest, appeal, or file suit with respect to any action or decision of the other party, including ordinances adopted by the City, that Company believes are in violation of any federal, state, or local laws, rules or regulations. The City shall provide Company notice and opportunity to review and comment upon proposed ordinances relating to the Public Rights-of-Way.

Company shall construct and maintain its facilities in conformance with the applicable provisions of the National Electric Safety Code or such comparable standards as may be adopted, and in a good and workmanlike manner. 
C.  The City retains the right to make visual, non-invasive inspections of the Company's facilities and upon reasonable notice and request, to require the Company to make available for inspection available records or data to demonstrate its current compliance with the terms of this Franchise. 
D.  The location of Company's facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way shall be subject to approval by the City Manager or the City Manager's designated representative (the "Manager") prior to construction; provided however, said approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. This approval will be obtained through the City's permitting process (if required by City Ordinance). In the event of a conflict between the location of the proposed facilities of Company and the locations of the facilities of City or other Public Rights-of-Way users which exist or have been authorized by the City, the Manager shall resolve the conflict and determine the location of the respective facilities within the Public Rights-of-Way. The Manager will designate a reasonable alternate location for Company's facilities if a reasonable alternate location exists and Company is required to move or install its facilities to a different location. The Company will use reasonable efforts to work with the City to avoid installing its facilities in park or City property other than utility easements or street, alley, or highway Right-of-Way. Company has the right to request City Council review of this or any actions concerning Company's use of the Public Rights-of-Way. 
E.  The Company shall restore at the Company's expense, all work within the City Rights-of-Way, to a condition equally as good as it was prior to being disturbed by Company's construction, excavation, repair or removal or to a condition agreed upon by City and Company. If City and Company agree that there are extenuating circumstances that do not allow for restoration of all work within the City Rights-of-Way to a condition equally as good as it was prior to being disturbed by Company, City and Company will negotiate an alternative restoration plan (in writing) to remedy the situation. 
F.  Company shall cooperate with the City in providing information regarding the location of current and future overhead and underground wires and poles within City's Public Rights-of-Way.

    The City reserves the right to lay, and permit to be laid, storm, sewer, gas, water, wastewater and other pipe lines, cables, and conduits, or other improvements or to do and permit to be done any underground or overhead work that City in its sole discretion determines may be necessary or proper in, across, along, over, or under Public Rights-of-Way occupied by Company. The City also reserves the right to change in any manner any curb, sidewalk, highway, alley, public way, street, utility lines, storm sewers, drainage basins, drainage ditches, and the like. 
    Upon request by City, Company shall relocate its facilities at the expense of the City except as otherwise required by Section 37.101(c) of PURA, which statutory provision currently states the governing body of a municipality may require an electric utility to relocate the utility's facility at the utility's expense to permit the widening or straightening of a street. City and Company further agree that widening and straightening of a street includes the addition of any acceleration, deceleration, center or side turn lanes, and sidewalks (meaning sidewalks done in conjunction with widening or straightening of a street), provided that the City shall provide Company with at least thirty (30) days notice and shall specify a new location for such facilities along the Public Rights-of-Way of the street. 
    If the City requires the Company to adapt or conform its Facilities, or in any manner to alter, relocate, or change its Facilities to enable any other corporation or person to use, or use with greater convenience, said street, alley, highway, or public way, the Company shall not be bound to make such changes until such other corporation or person shall have undertaken, with good and sufficient bond, to reimburse the Company for any costs, loss, or expense which will be caused by, or arises out of such change, alteration, or relocation of Company's Facilities. 
    If City abandons any Public Rights-of-Way in which Company has facilities such abandonment shall be conditioned on Company's right to maintain its use of the former Public Rights-of-Way and on the obligation of the party to whom the Public Rights-of-Way is abandoned to reimburse Company for all removal or relocation expenses if Company agrees to the removal or relocation of its facilities following abandonment of the Public Rights-of-Way. If the party to whom the Public Rights-of-Way is abandoned requests the Company to remove or relocate its facilities and Company agrees to such removal or relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable time at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation. If relocation cannot practically be made to another Public Rights-of-Way, the expense of any right-of-way acquisition shall be considered a relocation expense to be reimbursed by the party requesting the relocation. 
SECTION 4. INDEMNIFICATION: 
A.  In consideration of the granting of this Franchise, Company shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify and hold the City, and its past and present officers, agents and employees harmless against any and all liability arising from suits, actions or claims of injury to any person or persons, or damages to any property arising out of, or occasioned by the intentional and/or negligent acts or omissions of the Company or any of its officers, agents, or employees, in connection with Company's construction, maintenance and operation of Company's System in the Public Rights-of-Way, including any reasonable court costs, expenses and defenses thereof.

This provision is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the Company and the City. 
C.  In the event of joint and concurrent negligence or fault of both the Company and the City, responsibility and indemnity, if any, shall be apportioned comparatively between the City and Company in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under Texas law and without waiving any of the defenses of the parties under Texas law. Further, in the event of joint and concurrent negligence or fault of both the Company and the City, responsibility for all costs of defense shall be apportioned between the City and Company based upon the comparative fault of each. 
D.  In fulfilling its obligation to defend and indemnify City, Company shall have the right to select defense counsel, subject to City's approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Company shall retain defense counsel within seven (7) business days of City's written notice that City is invoking its right to indemnification under this Franchise. If Company fails to retain counsel within such time period, City shall have the right to retain defense counsel on its own behalf, and Company shall be liable for all reasonable defense costs incurred by City, except as otherwise provided in Section 4.B and 4.C.

B.  As authorized by Section 33.008(b) of PURA, the original franchise fee factor calculated for the City in 2002 was 0.002664 (the "Base Factor"), multiplied by each kilowatt hour of electricity delivered by Company to each retail customer whose consuming facility's point of delivery is located within the City's municipal boundaries for determining franchise payments going forward.

    However, should the Public Utility Commission of Texas at any time in the future disallow Company's recovery through rates of the higher franchise payments made under the Current Factor as compared to the Base Factor, then the franchise fee factor shall immediately revert to the Base Factor of 0.002664 and all future payments, irrespective of the time period that is covered by the payment, will be made using the Base Factor.

The initial Discretionary Service Charge franchise fee amount will be paid on or before April 30, 2016 and will be based on the calendar year January 1 through December 31, 2015. The final Discretionary Service Charge franchise fee amount will be paid on or before April 30, 2029 and will be based on the calendar year of January 1 through December 31, 2028. 
3.  Company may file a tariff or tariff amendment(s) to provide for the recovery of the franchise fee on Discretionary Service Charges. 
4.  City agrees (i) to the extent the City acts as regulatory authority, to adopt and approve that portion of any tariff which provides for 100% recovery of the franchise fee on Discretionary Service Charges; (ii) in the event the City intervenes in any regulatory proceeding before a federal or state agency in which the recovery of the franchise fees on such Discretionary Service Charges is an issue, the City will take an affirmative position supporting the 100% recovery of such franchise fees by Company and; (iii) in the event of an appeal of any such regulatory proceeding in which the City has intervened, the City will take an affirmative position in any such appeals in support of the 100% recovery of such franchise fees by Company.

F.  If Company fails to pay when due any payment provided for in this Section, Company shall pay such amount plus interest from such due date until payment is received by City. Interest shall be calculated in accordance with the interest rate for customer deposits established by the PUC in accordance with Texas Utilities Code Section 183.003 for the time period involved. 
SECTION 8. MOST FAVORED NATIONS: 
A.  This Section 8 applies only if, after the effective date of this Franchise Agreement, Company enters into a new municipal franchise agreement or renews an existing municipal franchise agreement with another municipality that provides for a different method of calculation of franchise fees for use of the Public Rights-of-Way than the calculation under PURA, Section 33.008(b), which, if applied to the City, would result in a greater amount of franchise fees owed the City than under this Franchise Agreement. 
B.  In the event of an occurrence as described in Section 8 hereof, City shall have the option to: 
1.  Have Company select, within 30 days of the City's request, any or all portions of the franchise agreement with the other municipality or comparable provisions that, at Company's sole discretion, must be considered in conjunction with the different method of the calculation of franchise fees included in that other franchise agreement; and 
2.  Modify this franchise agreement to include both the different method of calculation of franchise fee found in the franchise agreement with the other municipality and all of the other provisions identified by Company pursuant to Section 8.B.1. In no event shall City be able to modify the franchise to include the different method of calculation of franchise fee found in the franchise agreement with the other municipality without this franchise also being modified to include all of the other provisions identified by Company pursuant to Section 8.B.1. 
C.  City may not exercise the option provided in Section 8 if any of the provisions that would be included in this franchise are, in Company's sole opinion, inconsistent with or in any manner contrary to any then-current rule, regulation, ordinance, law, Code, or Charter. 
D.  In the event of a regulatory disallowance of the increase in franchise fees paid pursuant to City's exercise of its option under Section 8, then at any time after the regulatory authority's entry of an order disallowing recovery of the additional franchise fee expense in rates, Company shall have the right to cancel the modification of the franchise made pursuant to Section 8, and the terms of the Franchise shall immediately revert to those in place prior to City's exercise of its option under Section 8. 
E.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this franchise, should the City exercise the option provided in Section 8.B, and then adopt any rule, regulation, ordinance, law, Code, or Charter of City that, in Company's sole opinion, is inconsistent with or in any manner contrary to the provisions included in this franchise pursuant to Section 8.B, then Company shall have the right to cancel all of the modifications to this franchise made pursuant to Section 8 and, effective as of the date of the City's adoption of the inconsistent provision, the terms of the franchise shall revert to those in place prior to the City's exercise of its option under Section 8. 
F.  The provisions of Section 8 apply only to the amount of the franchise fee to be paid and do not apply to other franchise fee payment provisions, such as the timing of such payments. The provisions of Section 8 do not apply to differences in the franchise fee factor that result from the application of the methodology set out in Section 33.008(b) of PURA or a successor methodology. 
SECTION 9: RECORDS AND REPORTS: 
A.  Company shall keep accurate books of account at its principal office for the purpose of determining the amount due to the City under this Franchise. 
B.  Company shall provide City with a report notifying the City of the basis period for which the quarterly payment was made, the Total kWh in that basis period, the factor and the payment amount. This report may take the form of a letter to the City. 
C.  Pursuant to Section 33.008(e) of the Texas Utilities Code, the City may conduct an audit or other inquiry in relation to a payment made by Company less than two (2) years before the commencement of such audit or inquiry. The City may, if it sees fit, and upon reasonable notice to the Company, have the books and records of the Company examined by a representative of the City to ascertain the correctness of the reports agreed to be filed herein. 
D.  The Company shall make available to the auditor during the Company's regular business hours and upon reasonable notice, such personnel and records as the City may, in its reasonable discretion, request in order to complete such audit, and shall make no charge to the City therefore. 
E.  The Company shall assist the City in its review by responding to all requests for information no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of a request. 
F.  The City agrees to maintain the confidentiality of any non-public information obtained from Company to the extent allowed by law if Company identifies the information as non-public prior to providing the information to City. City shall not be liable to Company for the release of any information the City is required by law to release. City shall provide notice to Company of any request for release of non-public information prior to releasing the information so as to allow Company adequate time to pursue available remedies for protection. If the City receives a request under the Texas Public Information Act that includes information Company has identified as Company's proprietary information, City will notify the Texas Attorney General of the proprietary nature of the document(s). The City also will provide Company with a copy of this notification, and thereafter Company is responsible for establishing that an exception under the Act allows the City to withhold the information. 
G.  If either party discovers that the Company has either overpaid the City or failed to pay the entire or correct amount of compensation due the City, the correct amount shall be mutually determined by the City and Company and shall be paid by the responsible party within thirty (30) calendar days of such mutual determination. Such underpayments or overpayments shall include interest as provided for in Section 7.F. Any overpayment to the City by Company through error or otherwise, will, at the option of the City, either be refunded by City to Company within thirty (30) days of the mutual determination or be offset against the next payment due from Company. If the parties cannot mutually agree on either the underpayment due the City or an overpayment due the Company, both the City and Company may seek any other rights and remedies provided by law or in equity. Acceptance by the City or Company of any payment due under this Section shall not be deemed to be a waiver by the City or Company of any breach of this Franchise, nor shall the acceptance by the City or Company of any such payments preclude the City or Company from later establishing that a larger amount was actually due or from collecting any balance due. 
SECTION 10. TERM: 
    This Ordinance shall become effective upon Company's written acceptance hereof, said written acceptance to be filed by Company with the City Secretary within sixty (60) days after final passage and approval hereof. The right, privilege and franchise granted hereby shall expire on December 31, 2028 provided that, unless written notice of cancelation is given by either party hereto to the other not less than sixty (60) days before the expiration of this franchise agreement, it shall be automatically renewed for an additional period of six (6) months from such expiration date and shall be automatically renewed thereafter for like periods until canceled by written notice given not less than sixty (60) days before the expiration of any such renewal period. 
SECTION 11. REPEALER CLAUSE: 
    This Ordinance shall supersede any and all other franchises granted by the City to Company its predecessors and assigns, provided the parties agree any claim, action or complaint by either party that arose under or pursuant to any such previous franchise ordinance shall be preserved and saved from repeal, subject to all applicable statutes of limitations. 
SECTION 12. DEFAULT, REMEDIES. TERMINATION: 
A.  Events of Default. The occurrence, at any time during the term of the Franchise Agreement, of any one or more of the following events, shall constitute an Event of Default by Company under this Franchise: 
1.  The failure of Company to pay the franchise fee on or before the due dates specified herein. 
2.  Company's material breach or material violation of any material terms, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein. 
B.  Uncured Events of Default. 
1.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which can be cured by the immediate payment of money to City or a third party, Company shall have thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of written notice from City of an occurrence of such Event of Default to cure same before City may exercise any of its rights or remedies provided for in Section 12.C. 
2.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default by Company which cannot be cured by the immediate payment of money to City or a third party, Company shall have sixty (60) calendar days (or such additional time as may be agreed to by the City) from receipt of written notice from City of an occurrence of such Event of Default to cure same before City may exercise any of its rights or remedies provided for in Section 12.C. 
3.  If the Event of Default is not cured within the time period allowed for curing the Event of Default as provided for herein, such Event of Default shall, without additional notice, become an Uncured Event of Default, which shall entitle City to exercise the remedies provided for in Section 12.C. 
C.  Remedies. The City shall notify the Company in writing of an alleged Uncured Event of Default as described in Section 12.B, which notice shall specify the alleged failure with reasonable particularity. The Company shall, within thirty (30) business days after receipt of such notice or such longer period of time as the City may specify in such notice, either cure such alleged failure or in a written response to the City either present facts and arguments in refuting or defending such alleged failure or state that such alleged failure will be cured and set forth the method and time schedule for accomplishing such cure. In the event that such cure is not forthcoming, City shall be entitled to exercise any and all of the following cumulative remedies: 
1.  The commencement of an action against Company at law for monetary damages. 
2.  The commencement of an action in equity seeking injunctive relief or the specific performance of any of the provisions that as a matter of equity, are specifically enforceable. 
3.  The termination of this Franchise. 
D.  The rights and remedies of City and Company set forth in this Franchise Agreement shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies provided by law or in equity. City and Company understand and intend that such remedies shall be cumulative to the maximum extent permitted by law and the exercise by City of any one or more of such remedies shall not preclude the exercise by City, at the same or different times, of any other such remedies for the same failure to cure. However, notwithstanding this Section or any other provision of this Franchise, City shall not recover both liquidated damages and actual damages for the same violation, breach, or noncompliance, either under this Section or under any other provision of this Franchise. 
E.  Termination. In accordance with the provisions of Section 12.C, this Franchise may be terminated upon thirty (30) business days prior written notice to Company. City shall notify Company in writing at least fifteen (15) business days in advance of the City Council meeting at which the question of forfeiture or termination shall be considered, and Company shall have the right to appear before the City Council in person or by counsel and raise any objections or defenses Company may have that are relevant to the proposed forfeiture or termination. The final decision of the City Council may be appealed to any court or regulatory authority having jurisdiction. Upon timely appeal by Company of the City Council's decision terminating the Franchise, the effective date of such termination shall be either when such appeal is withdrawn or an order upholding the termination becomes final and unappealable. Until the termination becomes effective the provisions of this Franchise shall remain in effect for all purposes. The City recognizes Company's right and obligation to provide service in accordance with the Certificate of Convenience and Necessity authorized by the Public Utility Commission of Texas in accordance with the Texas Utilities Code. 
F.  This Franchise Ordinance shall be construed and governed by the laws of the State of Texas. City and Company agree that any lawsuit between the City and the Company concerning this Ordinance will be filed in the state of Texas. Nothing in this Ordinance shall prohibit the City from filing an action related to this Ordinance in Tarrant County, Texas.
