PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Carrollton, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1993 Code, as supplemented through April 16, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1993 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a decimal. The figure before the decimal refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the decimal refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1.02, and the first section of chapter 11 is 11.02. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 11.01 and 11.02 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 11.015. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CHARTER ..... CHT:1 
CODE ..... CD1:1 
TABLE OF SPECIAL ORDINANCES ..... TSO:1 
PARRALLEL REFERENCE TABLES ..... PRT1:1 
CODE INDEX ..... CDi:1 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and Bonnie Mitchell, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ashley D. Mitchell, City Secretary for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Carrollton readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

CARROLLTON, TEXAS - CHARTER 
ARTICLE I. - INCORPORATION FORM OF GOVERNMENT-POWERS 

Sec. 1.01. - Incorporation. 
    The inhabitants of the City of Carrollton in Dallas, Denton, and Collin Counties, Texas, within the corporate limits as now established or as hereafter established in the manner prescribed by this Charter shall be and shall continue to be a municipal body politic and corporate in perpetuity under the name of the "City of Carrollton." 
(Adopted by electorate, 9-19-61; Am. Ord. 1361 passed 4-7-87) 
Sec. 1.02. - Form of government. 
    The municipal government provided by this Charter shall be known as the "council-manager" government. Pursuant to its provisions and subject only to the limitations imposed by the State Constitution, by the statutory laws of Texas, and by this Charter, all powers of the city shall be vested in an elective council, hereinafter referred to as the "council," which shall enact local legislation, determine policies, and appoint the city manager, who shall execute the laws and administer the government of the city. All powers of the city shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this Charter, or if the manner be not prescribed, then in such a manner as may be prescribed by ordinance. 
(Adopted by electorate, 9-19-61; Am. Ord. 1361 passed 4-7-87; Am. Ord. 2364 passed 8-11-98) 
Sec. 1.03. - Annexation and disannexation. 
(1)  Extension of city limits by petition. Whenever a majority of the qualified voters who are citizens of the State of Texas and inhabitants of any territory adjoining the City of Carrollton, as said territory may be designated by the council, or in case there are no qualified voters in said territory, then when persons owning a majority of the land in area in said territory, desire the annexation of such territory to the City of Carrollton, they may present a written petition to that effect to the council and shall attach to said petition an affidavit of one or more of their number to the effect that said petition is signed by a majority of such qualified voters, or in the case there are no qualified voters said affidavit shall be to the effect that there are no qualified voters in said territory and that the persons signing the petition own a majority of the land in said territory. The city council shall provide an opportunity for all interested persons to be heard in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. The council at regular session or in special session held not sooner than thirty (30) days after the presentation of said petition may by ordinance annex such territory to the City of Carrollton and thenceforth the boundary limits of the city shall be fixed by such ordinance and the territory so annexed shall be a part of the City of Carrollton and the inhabitants thereof shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of other citizens and shall be bound by the acts, ordinances, resolutions, and regulations of said city, and the property situated therein shall bear its pro rata part of the taxes levied by the city. 
(2)  Extension of city limits by ordinance. A second method of extending the corporate limits of the City of Carrollton shall be that the council shall have the power by ordinance to fix the boundary limits of said city and to provide for the extension of said boundary limits by the annexation of additional territory lying adjacent to said city, with or without the consent of the inhabitants of the territory annexed. The city council shall provide an opportunity for all interested persons to be heard in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. Upon the introduction of such an ordinance in the council, it shall be published in the official newspaper of the city one time, and shall not thereafter be finally acted upon until at least thirty (30) days have elapsed after the first publication thereof. Amendments not enlarging or not extending the boundary limits set forth in the published ordinance may be incorporated into the proposed ordinance without the necessity of republication of said ordinance as amended. Upon the final passage of any annexation ordinance, the boundary limits of the city shall thereafter be fixed by such ordinance and the territory so annexed shall be a part of the City of Carrollton, and the inhabitants thereof shall be entitled to all rights and privileges of other citizens and shall be bound by the acts, ordinances, resolutions, and regulations of the City of Carrollton, and the property situated therein shall bear its pro rata part of the taxes levied by the city. 
(3)  Disannexation. Whenever there exists within the corporate limits of the city any territory not suitable or necessary for city purposes, the council may, upon a petition signed by a majority of the qualified voters residing in such territory if the same be inhabited, or without any such petition if the same be uninhabited, by ordinance duly passed, discontinue said territory as a part of said city; said petition and ordinance shall specify accurately the metes and bounds of the territory sought to be eliminated from the city and shall contain a plat designating such territory so that the same can be definitely ascertained. The city council shall provide an opportunity for all interested persons to be heard. Upon the introduction of such an ordinance in the council, it shall be published in the official newspaper of the city one time, and shall not thereafter be finally acted upon until at least thirty (30) days have elapsed after the first publication thereof. When said ordinance has been duly passed the same shall be entered upon the minutes and records of said city, and from and after the entry of such ordinance said territory shall cease to be a part of said city, but said territory shall still be liable for its pro rata share of any debts incurred while said area was a part of said city, and the city shall continue to levy, assess and collect taxes on the property within said territory to pay the indebtedness incurred while said area was a part of the city as though the same had not been excluded from the boundaries of the city. 
(4)  The preceding requirements of publication and public hearings shall not apply to mutually agreed upon changes in boundaries with adjacent municipalities when the area of change is less than 1,000 feet in width. 
(Adopted by electorate, 9-19-61; Am. Ord. 1361 passed 4-7-87; Am. Ord. 2364 passed 8-11-98) 
Sec. 1.04. - Powers. 
    The City of Carrollton may exercise all powers that now are or hereafter may be granted to municipalities by the Constitution or the laws of the State of Texas. All such powers, whether expressed or implied shall be exercised and enforced in the manner prescribed by this Charter, and when not prescribed herein, in such manner as may be provided by ordinance or resolution of the council of the City of Carrollton. 
    The enumeration of particular powers in this Charter shall not be held or deemed to be exclusive, but in addition to the, powers enumerated herein, implied thereby or appropriate to the exercise thereof, the city may have and shall exercise all other powers which, under the Constitution of the State of Texas, it would be competent for the Charter specifically to enumerate. The City of Carrollton shall have and exercise all of the powers conferred upon cities by what is known as the Home Rule Amendment to the Constitution of the State of Texas and the enabling act relative thereto, passed by the Thirty-third Legislative of the State of Texas, found in the published laws, of said legislature, regular session, pages 307 to 317, and effective July 7, 1913, and all other laws passed by the legislature of the State of Texas, relating thereto, or which may hereafter be passed by said legislature in relation to such matters. 
    The City of Carrollton may acquire property within or without its corporate limits for any municipal purpose; may cooperate with the government of Texas or any agency thereof, or with the federal government or any agency thereof, or with the government of any county, city, or political subdivision to accomplish any lawful purpose for the advancement of the health, morals, safety, convenience, or welfare of the City of Carrollton or its inhabitants, may sell, lease, mortgage, hold, manage and control such property as its interest may require; provided the city shall not sell, convey, lease, mortgage, or otherwise alienate any public utility without prior approval of the qualified voters of the city; may exercise the power of eminent domain when necessary or desirable to carry out any of the powers conferred upon it by this Charter or the Constitution or laws of the State of Texas; and may lay out, establish, open, alter, widen, lower, extend, grade, abandon, close, care for, dispose of, abolish, discontinue, pave, supervise, maintain and improve streets, alleys, sidewalks, parks, squares, public places and bridges; and regulate the use thereof and require the removal from streets, sidewalks, alleys and other public property or places of all obstructions and all fruit stands, show cases and encroachments of every nature or character upon any of said streets, sidewalks, or other public property. 
    Provided, however, nothing included above or anywhere in this charter shall authorize the City of Carrollton, or any corporations, agency or entity created by the City, or pursuant to the City's approval and authorization, to institute and exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire private or public property if the purpose of the acquisition is the promotion of economic development for a private business enterprise which business enterprise would own any right, title, or interest in the property so acquired.

If a member of the council shall cease to possess any of these qualifications or shall be convicted, including the entering of any plea and receiving deferred adjudication, of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, his or her office shall immediately become vacant. 
    If a member of the council shall announce his or her candidacy, in any general, special or primary election, for any office of profit or trust under the laws of this state or the United States other than the office then held, at any time when the unexpired term of the office then held shall exceed one (1) year, such announcement or such candidacy shall constitute an automatic resignation of the office then held. Such resignation shall become effective on the date of the next regular municipal general election or the election for which such candidacy is announced, whichever occurs first. 
    A person who has served as a member of the city council in any place, other than mayor, for two (2) consecutive terms, shall not again be eligible for election in any place on the city council except mayor, until at least one term approximating three years has elapsed. A person who has served two (2) consecutive terms as mayor shall not again be eligible for election as mayor until at least one term approximating three years has elapsed, but shall be eligible for election as a member of the city council in any place, other than mayor. A "term" as used in this paragraph, is that period of time beginning with the taking of the oath of office and running through the oath of office following the next election for that office. Partial terms will not be counted when determining term limits. 
(Adopted by electorate, 9-19-61; Am. Ord. 1361 passed 4-7-87; Am. Prop., 5-2-92; Am. Ord. 2364 passed 8-11-98; Am. Ord. 2627 passed 8-14-01)

    The office of mayor or council member shall become vacant upon the holder's death, resignation, removal from office or forfeiture of office in any manner authorized by this charter or state law. A member may resign by submitting a statement in writing to the city secretary. The resignation shall be effective upon receipt in that office. 
    Upon affirmative vote of the majority of the city council, the mayor or any council member shall forfeit the office if that person: 
(1)  Lacks at any time during the term of office for which elected any qualification for the office prescribed by this charter or by law, or 
(2)  Fails to attend three consecutive regular meetings of the council, or 25 percent of the regular meetings in any six-month period, without being excused by the council. 
    In the event a vacancy occurs in the office of mayor or council member from any cause whatsoever the council shall, as soon as practicable, order an election to be held on the next available election date authorized by state law for the purpose of filling such office for the remainder of the unexpired term; provided, however, no such election shall be held any later than 120 days after such vacancy or vacancies occur. 
(Adopted by electorate, 9-19-61; Am. Prop. 1, ratified 4-16-65; Am. Ord. 1361 passed 4-7-87; Am. Ord. 2364 passed 8-11-98; Am. Ord. 2627 passed 8-14-01) 
Sec. 2.05. - Presiding officer; the mayor. 
    The mayor shall preside at meetings of the council, and shall be recognized as head of city government for all ceremonial purposes and by the governor for purpose of military law, but shall have no regular administrative duties. The mayor may participate in the discussion of all matters coming before the council.

Sec. 52.037. - Extension for individual owners inside city limits. 
(A)  Standard method. 
(1)  Upon request of the owner, or his agent, of a given lot or tract of land, for the purpose of this subchapter known as the "applicant," accompanied by a payment of the charges due under this subchapter, the city shall extend, lay or construct all necessary sanitary sewer and water mains, including valves and hydrants, a distance of 100 feet, plus the distance across the frontage necessary to provide the service for which application has been made. The property owner to be served shall be required to pay the charge herein provided for. The owners of all intervening property served by the given main extension shall be required to pay the charges provided for herein at that time as their property is connected to the mains thus laid. Where an applicant for service secures an extension and service under this particular option for main extension, he shall pay the pro rata charges on all property owned by him which is served by the extension requested. In applying the 100-foot rule, the required extension of mains shall be figured in a manner as to leave out of the calculations that portion of any main adjacent to property already having other than a temporary water service and for which the pro rata charge thereon has been paid or credited under the terms of this subchapter. 
(2)  An exception to the above 100-foot rule shall be made where two or more individual applicants desire water and/or sewer service and the nearest applicant is more than 100 feet from existing lines, in which case the city will extend its mains upon payment of the charge due under this subchapter, provided there is one customer for each 100 feet of the extension, excluding street intersections and that portion of the extension adjacent to property already having other than temporary water and/or sewer service. 
(B)  Optional method. 
(1)  At the option of the city, the following method for extending water and sewer mains may be used where the applicant's property is more than 100 feet from an existing water or sewer main. This method shall be available only for use by an individual owner, person or corporation to secure water and sewer service for the individual's residence or place of business. Where eligible for this option, the owner may advance and pay to the city the entire pro rata costs as set forth in this subchapter on all property served by the desired main extension, and the city, when that money has been actually deposited, will construct the desired water sewer main along a street, alley or easement. When any property for which that person has advanced the pro rata costs is connected to the main extension; then, in that event, the pro rata cost connected on that particular property shall be refunded by the city to the person making the original deposit. 
(2)  In determining the basis for assessing pro rata charges, the provisions as set forth herein shall apply; however, in determining pro rata for off-site mains, the front foot method shall apply, and refunds to the original depositor shall be made on the basis of the front foot plan regardless of the basis applied when assessing the adjacent properties. 
(C)  Extension for industry or commercial concern. Where an extension is requested by an industry or commercial concern using large quantities of water and which cannot meet the requirements of one customer per 100 feet of extension, such extension may be made at the discretion of the city, provided 40 percent of the estimated annual revenue from such customer will support interest and principal payments on ten-year loan on the cost of the extension, at six percent per annum.

(A)  Where extensions of the water or sewer system are required to serve property inside the city which has been subdivided or platted for development and resale, the city may, at the discretion of the city council, construct those off-site mains as necessary to serve the property providing that the property being served contain at least five acres and the pro rata charges as prescribed herein are equal to an amount of not less than 25 percent of the cost for main extensions. 
(B)  Where extensions of the water and sewer system are requested and extension of the system does not meet the above requirements, the service may be provided under the following conditions: 
(1)  The developer may deposit with the city an amount equal to the total cost of all off-street mains necessary to connect the system with the proposed development, less the additional cost involved in installing mains in excess of 12 inches in diameter. These deposits shall be refunded under conditions as hereinafter prescribed. 
(2)  (a)  The developer may proceed with extension of mains necessary to connect the system with the proposed development under separate contract, with all cost being borne by the developer, providing that plans and specifications have previously been approved by the city and further providing that the contractor is properly bonded and insured. Upon completion of the project, a maintenance bond shall be furnished to the city to insure all materials and workmanship for a period of two years. 
(b)  After the project has been completed, the developer may file a statement of charges with the city, and after acceptance by the city council, would be filed for refund to the developer under conditions as hereinafter prescribed. All costs incurred by the developer for extension of off-site mains in excess of twelve inches in diameter would be payable to the developer upon completion of the main extensions. 
(C)  Refunds to the developer. The developer will be entitled to refund of all the cost incurred in extension of standard size off-site mains, excluding the amount of pro rata applicable to his development as prescribed herein. The total refund to the developer shall not exceed the amount of his deposit (less applicable pro rata) as defined in division (B)(1) of this section, or the amount of his statement of charges, (less applicable pro rata) as defined in division (B)(2) of this section. 
(D)  In the event it becomes desirable to extend the system beyond the bounds of the development as described above, or beyond the adjacent properties where off-site mains were built or paid for by the developer, the first developer will be entitled to payment in full as described in division (C) of this section, less any previous refunds, before the main is further extended. The second developer would then be entitled to refund of charges incurred in the first and second main extensions to the limit as outlined in division (C) of this section. 
(E)  The developer will bear the total cost of on-site mains, with plans and specifications to be approved by the city, except that the city will refund the cost of mains in excess of twelve inches in diameter, providing the additional main capacity is designed to serve property beyond the limits of the development. 
(F)  (1)  Wherever on-site mains are provided by the developer, as required by the city and the mains are considered to enhance area outside or adjacent to the area being developed, the developer will be entitled to a refund of one-half the cost of installing the mains. If the same mains are later utilized by adjacent properties in a similar manner as required of the first properties in a similar manner as required of the first developer, an amount equal to the one-half cost, as refunded to the first developer, shall be assessed against the second developer in addition to the normal pro rata charge as prescribed herein. 
(2)  There shall be a maximum of ten years as a period of eligibility wherein the original depositor may request a refund of pro rata payments made under this section. The period of eligibility shall begin as of the date of final inspection and acceptance of the extensions by the city. 
(3)  Where temporary lines are constructed as an expedient to develop a particular area, such as across easements, within the subdivision on which no frontage can be connected, or where sewers are constructed which otherwise are not required in the ultimate plan of development for the sanitary sewer system, the developer will bear the total cost without refund.

Upon receipt of a timely request, the City Manager or his designee shall notify the person of the date and time of the hearing on the administrative adjudication. The administrative adjudication hearing shall be held before a hearing officer appointed by the City Manager. 
(B)  Failure to pay a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability in the full amount of the civil penalty assessed in the notice of violation, and is a waiver of the right to appeal under division (I) hereinafter. 
(C)  The civil penalty shall not be assessed if after a hearing, the hearing officer enters a finding of "no liability". 
(D)  In an administrative adjudication hearing, the issues must be proved at the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence. The reliability of the red light electronic enforcement system used to produce the recorded image of the violation may be attested to in an administrative adjudication hearing by affidavit of an municipal peace officer; or it may be attested by affidavit by an employee of the red light electronic enforcement system provider who is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system.

(5)  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle and being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner; 
(6)  The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was a stolen plate and being displayed on a motor vehicle other than the motor vehicle for which the plate had been issued; 
(7)  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually hazardous road conditions existed that would make compliance with this chapter more dangerous under the circumstances than noncompliance; or 
(8)  The person who received the notice of violation was not the owner of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. 
(G)  To demonstrate that at the time of the violation the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate, the owner must submit reasonable proof to the hearing officer that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency. 
(H)  Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, a person who fails to pay the amount of a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing on the violation if: 
(1)  The person files an affidavit with the hearing officer stating the date on which the person received the notice of violation that was mailed to the person; and

Unless the person, on or before the filing of the notice of appeal, posts a bond in the amount of the civil penalty and any late fees, an appeal does not stay the enforcement of the civil penalty. An appeal shall be determined by the Municipal Court by trial de novo. The affidavits submitted under division (D) shall be admitted by a municipal judge in the trial de novo, and the issues must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. The City Attorney's Office shall prosecute appeals cases under this section. 
(J)  A person found liable by the Municipal Court shall pay an appellate filing fee of $50.00 in addition to the civil penalty and any other fees due the city. 
(Ord. 3125, passed 3-6-07)

(A)  The hearing officer at any administrative adjudication hearing under this chapter shall issue an order stating:

(Ord. 3125, passed 3-6-07) 
Sec. 74.06. - Effect of liability; exclusion of civil remedy. 
(A)  The imposition of a civil penalty under this chapter is not a criminal conviction for any purpose. 
(B)  A civil penalty may not be imposed under this chapter on the owner of a motor vehicle if the operator of the vehicle was arrested, or was issued a citation and notice to appear by a peace officer for the same violation of illegally entering an intersection while facing a steady red light, recorded by the red light electronic enforcement system. 
(C)  An owner who fails to pay the civil penalty or to timely contest liability for the penalty is considered to admit liability for the full amount of the civil penalty stated in the notice of violation mailed to the person. 
(D)  The City Attorney is authorized to file suit to enforce collection of a civil penalty imposed under this chapter. 
(Ord. 3125, passed 3-6-07) 
Sec. 74.07. - Mobility and safety fund (MSF).

Sec. 76.04. - School bus stop arm violations as civil offenses; defenses; presumptions. 
(A)  The owner of a motor vehicle that is operated in violation of Section 545.066 of the Texas Transportation Code, as amended, by passing a stopped camera-enforced school bus displaying the visual signals required by Section 547.701(c) of the Texas Transportation Code, as amended, commits a civil offense and is liable for a civil fine per violation and any other cumulative penalties, fines, and fees, if any, as set forth in section 76.11 of this chapter. 
(B)  It is a defense to a charge of a school bus stop arm violation under this section: 
(1)  The camera-enforced school bus was not operating the visual signals required by Section 547.701(c) of the Texas Transportation Code, as amended; 
(2)  The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of a law enforcement officer; 
(3)  The operator of the motor vehicle was in the process of passing the camera-enforced school bus before the camera-enforced school bus operated a visual signal described by Section 547.701(c) of the Texas Transportation Code, as amended; 
(4)  The operator of the motor vehicle passed the stopped camera-enforced school bus so as to yield the right-of-way to an immediately approaching authorized emergency vehicle; 
(5)  The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle under Chapter 546 of the Texas Transportation Code, as amended, and the operator was acting in compliance with that chapter; 
(6)  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle being operated by a person other than the vehicle's owner without the consent of the vehicle owner and proof is submitted to the hearing officer that the theft of the motor vehicle had been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency; 
(7)  The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the school bus stop arm violation was a stolen plate being displayed on a motor vehicle other than the motor vehicle for which the plate had been issued and proof is submitted to the hearing officer that the theft of the license plate had been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency; or 
(8)  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain, or other unusually hazardous road conditions existed that would have made compliance with this chapter more dangerous under the circumstances than non-compliance. 
(C)  It is presumed that the registered owner of the vehicle depicted in the recorded image of a school bus stop arm violation for which a notice of violation is issued is the vehicle owner who committed the school bus stop arm violation. Proof of ownership may be made by a computer-generated record of the registration of the vehicle with the Texas Department of Transportation showing the name of the vehicle owner to whom state license plates were issued. This proof is prima facie evidence of the ownership of the vehicle by the vehicle owner to whom the certificate of registration was issued. 
(D)  A vehicle owner who is in the business of selling, renting, or leasing vehicles will not be liable for the civil school bus stop arm fines, penalties, and costs imposed by the city on a vehicle for sale or a rented or leased vehicle if the vehicle owner presents evidence establishing that the vehicle depicted in the recorded image was at the time of the alleged violation being rented, leased, or test driven by another person. Evidence sufficient to establish that the vehicle was being rented, leased, or test driven includes: 
(1)  The true name, address, and driver's license number and state of issuance of the person renting, leasing, or test driving the vehicle at the time the recorded image of the school bus stop arm violation was taken; or 
(2)  A true copy of the lease or rental agreement in effect at the time the recorded image of the school bus stop arm violation was taken. 
(E)  Evidence presented under subsection (D) of this section must be presented through oral testimony or by affidavit under penalty of perjury.

(F)  If the owner of a vehicle presents evidence under subsections (D) and (E) of this section establishing that the vehicle depicted in the recorded image was being rented, leased, or test driven at the time of the violation, the vehicle owner may not be held liable for civil school bus stop arm fines, penalties, and costs, and the law enforcement officer shall send the notice of violation to the test driver or lessee who is presumed to have committed the school bus stop arm violation. An owner of a vehicle who fails to comply with subsections (D) or (E) of this section will be treated as any other vehicle owner and will be liable for the school bus stop arm violation. 
(G)  If, at the time the recorded image of the school bus stop arm violation was taken, the vehicle depicted in the recorded image was owned by a person in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles and the vehicle was being rented or leased to an individual, the vehicle owner shall, within 30 calendar days after the date the notice of violation is received, provide to the Administrator the name and address of the individual who was renting or leasing the motor vehicle depicted in the recorded image and a statement of the period during which that individual was renting or leasing the vehicle. This information must be provided regardless of whether the vehicle owner provides evidence under subsections (D) and (E) of this section that the vehicle was being rented, leased, or test driven at the time of the school bus stop arm violation. 
(H)  A registered vehicle owner named in the notice of violation who did not hold legal title to the motor vehicle at the time of a school bus stop arm violation will not be liable for the civil school bus stop arm fines, penalties, and costs imposed by the city on that vehicle if the registered vehicle owner presents evidence establishing that another vehicle owner held legal title to the vehicle at the time the recorded image of the school bus stop arm violation was taken. Evidence sufficient to establish that the vehicle was owned by another vehicle owner at the time of the school bus stop arm violation includes: 
(1)  The true name, address, and driver's license number and state of issuance of the vehicle owner who held legal title to the vehicle at the time the recorded image of the school bus stop arm violation was taken; or 
(2)  A true copy of any purchase or sale documentation (including proof of transfer of title) showing the name of the vehicle owner who held title to the vehicle at the time the recorded image of the school bus stop arm violation was taken (that vehicle owner's address must also be provided if not contained in the documentation). 
(I)  Evidence presented under subsection (H) of this section must be presented through oral testimony or by affidavit under penalty of perjury. Evidence through oral testimony must be presented at the administrative adjudication hearing. Evidence by affidavit under penalty of perjury may be presented by mail. 
(J)  If the registered vehicle owner named in the notice of violation complies with subsections (H) and (I) of this section, the registered vehicle owner may not be held liable for civil school bus stop arm fines, penalties, and costs, and law enforcement officer shall send the notice of violation to the vehicle owner who held legal title to the vehicle at the time the recorded image of the school bus stop arm violation was taken. A registered vehicle owner named in the notice of violation who fails to comply with subsections (H) and (I) of this section will be treated as any other vehicle owner and will be liable for the school bus stop arm violation.

(11)  A notification that any request by the vehicle owner to have the law enforcement officer who issued the notice of violation, present at the hearing must be made in writing as part of the written request for an administrative adjudication hearing and that failure to timely make this request constitutes a waiver of the vehicle owner's right to require the presence of the law enforcement officer at the hearing. 
(12)  A notification that failure to pay the civil fine or to timely request an administrative adjudication hearing is considered an admission of liability for the school bus stop arm violation, is a waiver of the vehicle owner's right to appeal the imposition of the civil fine, and will result in the assessment of appropriate civil fines, penalties, and costs. 
(13)  A statement that the vehicle owner will incur a late payment penalty if the vehicle owner fails to pay the civil fine or request an administrative adjudication hearing within 30 calendar days after the date of issuance of the notice of violation.

An affidavit of the Administrator, officer or employee of the city that alleges a school bus stop arm violation based on an inspection of the pertinent recorded image is admissible in a proceeding under this chapter, is evidence of the facts contained in the affidavit, and is prima facie evidence of the violation alleged in the notice of violation. 
(F)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall immediately render an order or decision, either by: 
(1)  Finding the vehicle owner liable for the school bus stop arm violation, assessing the applicable civil fine and any penalties and other costs in accordance with this chapter, and notifying the vehicle owner of the right to appeal to municipal court; or

    Apartment complex crime index. The apartment complex crime index is calculated by dividing the total reportable events creditable to the apartment complex (A) by the total number of units in the apartment complex (B), then multiplying the product by 100, giving a ratio of crimes per 100 units for the apartment complex. This formula is expressed as: 
(A/B) x 100 = Apartment Complex Crime Index 
    Board. The Carrollton Property Standards Board. 
    City crime index. The city crime index is calculated by dividing the total reportable events in the city (X) by the total number of housing units in the city (Y), then multiplying the product by 100, giving a ratio of crimes per 100 housing units. This formula is expressed as: 
(X/Y) x 100 = City Crime Index 
    Crime risk safety threshold. The crime risk safety threshold is the city crime index. 
    City Manager. The City Manager or the City Manager's designee. 
    Designated apartment complex. An apartment complex whose apartment complex crime index exceeds the crime risk safety threshold. 
    Housing unit. A residence such as a house, apartment, mobile home, or room(s) within a structure providing a space for occupants making up a single household to live and eat.

    Owner. The owner of an apartment complex located in the City of Carrollton, Texas, including a person who shares an ownership interest in an apartment complex. 
    Reportable events. Reportable events include any and all incidents that occur in the city and that cause an offense or arrest report to be generated by the Police Department. Reportable events include any investigation or self-initiated activity based on the observation(s) of a city police officer which results in an offense or arrest report. Notwithstanding the foregoing, reportable events shall not include: 
(1)  Arrests or offenses that result only from transition onto an apartment complex from the street as a result of police initiated traffic enforcement; 
(2)  Status offenses, i.e., offenses that constitute criminal activity because of the age of the accused, except the alcohol-related offenses of minor in possession and minor in consumption shall be included; 
(3)  Forgery and fraud offenses in which the victim resides at the apartment complex; 
(4)  Identity theft offenses in which victim resides at the apartment complex; 
(5)  Family violence offenses in which the victim resides at the apartment complex; and 
(6)  Criminal offenses or arrests that arise from an incident where an agent is the only complainant or from information provided to the Police Department solely by an agent. 
    The reportable events creditable to an apartment complex include any reportable events that occur on the premises of an apartment complex, including any reportable events occurring within the surrounding area that, through information or investigation, can be attributed to or traced to the premises of the apartment complex.

However, the downtown areas as herein defined shall not be exempted from permits. In the event that provisions contained in this chapter conflict with other ordinance provisions regulating temporary activities, the provisions contained in this chapter shall govern. This chapter does not authorize the use of lawns or parking lots associated with municipal buildings.

(3)  Any party may examine or cross-examine any witness before the Board. Strict rules of evidence or procedure are not required, but the Board has the authority to enforce strict decorum and may cause the removal of anyone who causes a disruption. 
(C)  Findings and orders of the Board. After hearing evidence from any interested party the Board may: 
(1)  Find that the structure is not dangerous, substandard, dilapidated, unfit for human habitation or a hazard to the public health, safety and welfare, and refer the matter to the Building Official for appropriate action.

(G)  The city may use any lawful means to collect repair and demolition costs and civil penalties from an owner. Any civil penalty or other assessment imposed under this section accrues interest at the rate of ten percent a year from the date of the assessment until paid in full. In any judicial proceeding regarding enforcement of city rights under this section, the city is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees if it prevails.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 151.10. - Board of Adjustment. 
(A)  The Board of Adjustment (Board) shall consist of nine members who are residents and taxpayers of the City of Carrollton, each to be appointed by a majority of the City Council for a term of two years and removable for cause by the City Council. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member, whose place becomes vacant for any cause, in the same manner as the original appointment was made. 
(B)  All cases to be heard by the Board shall always be heard by a minimum number of seven members. 
(Am. Ord. 3146, passed 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 151.11. - Operational procedure. 
(A)  The Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules to govern its proceedings provided that such rules are not inconsistent with this chapter or state law. Meetings of the Board will be held at the call of the Chairperson or at times the Board determines it necessary. All meetings shall be held in accordance with the Open Meetings Law. The Chairperson, or in his absence, the acting Chairperson, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. 
(B)  The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and other official actions. All records shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record. 
(C)  Appeals to the Board can be taken by any person aggrieved, or by any officer, department or board of the city affected by any decision of the Building Official relative to the enforcement of this chapter. Such appeal shall be taken within 15 days' time after the decision has been rendered by the Building Official, by filing with the Building Official and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and upon payment of a fee in an amount determined by the City Council. The Building Official shall forthwith transmit to the Board all of the papers constituting the records upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(D)  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed for until the Board takes action, unless the Building Official certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed, that in his opinion such stay will cause imminent peril to life. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or a court of record on application or notice to the Building Official and due cause shown. Any criminal action having been commenced in the Municipal Court shall not be stayed. 
(E)  No appeal to the Board for the same or a related action on the same piece of property shall be allowed prior to the expiration of six months from the previous ruling by the Board, unless other property in the immediate vicinity has within the said six months, been changed or acted on by the Board or City Council so as to alter the facts and conditions upon which the previous Board action was based, as determined by the Board. Such change of circumstances shall permit the rehearing of an appeal prior to the expiration of a six-month period, but such conditions shall not have any force in law to compel the Board after hearing, to grant a subsequent appeal; such subsequent appeal shall be considered entirely on its merits and the peculiar and specific conditions related to the property on which the appeal is brought. 
(F)  At a public hearing relative to an appeal, any interested party may appear before the Board in person or by agent or by attorney. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to establish the necessary facts to warrant favorable action of the Board on any matter. Any action granting a variance authorizing the issuance of a sign permit shall be valid for only 90 days unless said permit is secured in the 90-day period and construction is commenced in accordance with the Building Code, in which event the action of the Board shall be permanent. The Board shall have the authority to extend this period. If said sign permit is not secured in the 90 days, or such period granted by the Board, the action of the Board shall become void without prejudice to a subsequent appeal and such appeal shall be subject to the same regulation and requirement for hearing as herein specified for the original appeal.

The Board shall have the power to impose reasonable conditions in order to assure compliance and protect adjacent property. 
(B)  The concurring vote of seven members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Building Official, or to decide in favor of the applicant in any matter upon which the Board is required to act under this subchapter or to cause any variance to this chapter.

Notice shall be given by publishing the same at least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Carrollton at least ten days prior to the date of such hearing, which notice shall state the time and place of such hearing. 
(Am. Ord. 3146, passed 6-19-2007) 
Sec. 151.14. - Jurisdiction of the Board of Adjustment. 
(A)  When in its judgment, the public convenience and welfare will be substantially served and the appropriate use of the neighboring property will not be substantially injured, the Board may, in specific cases, after public notice and public hearing, and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, act upon certain items, as identified herein below: 
(1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error on any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Building Official in the enforcement of this code. 
(2)  To authorize the reconstruction of a nonconforming sign for an existing business provided such reconstruction does not, in the judgment of the Board, increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign. 
(3)  To authorize such variances where the literal enforcement of the provisions of this code would result in an unnecessary hardship, and where such variances are deemed necessary to permit a sign on a specific parcel of land which differs from other parcels of land in the same district by being of such restricted area, shape or slope that a sign cannot be placed on the parcel in a manner commensurate with those signs permitted on other parcels of land in the same district. The modification of the standards established in this code shall not be granted to relieve a self-created or personal hardship, nor for financial reason alone, nor shall such modification be granted to permit any person a privilege in placing a sign on a parcel of land not permitted by this code to other parcels of land in that district. 
(4)  To authorize the use of an alternate material, design standard, or method of construction, where the board finds the alternate is satisfactory and complies with the provisions of the sign code and finds that the material, design standard, or alternate method of construction is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the code in quality, strength, effectiveness, durability and safety. 
(5)  To authorize a special exception for one off-site temporary directional ground sign for single-family residential subdivisions. The sign is limited to 32 square feet in area, 12 feet in height and a minimum of 25 feet from any street abutting property lot lines. A sign shall be allowed only in case of a geographical hardship and for a specified time period, but not longer than three years. 
(6)  To authorize a special exception allowing a single business to include their company logo or name on a subdivision entry sign structure when the Board determines the following: 
(a)  That the granting of such special exception will be consistent with the general purpose and intent of this section, and will serve the general welfare and preserve the community interest; 
(b)  The request is for a minimum subdivision size of 100 acres; 
(c)  A single logo or company name is limited to the permitted subdivision entry sign structures at the one main entrance to the subdivision; 
(d)  The logo or name must be subordinate to the subdivision identification sign; and 
(e)  Any conditions that will secure substantially the purpose and intent of this section. 
(7)  To authorize a special exception allowing a business wall sign increased area within the Old Downtown District when the Board determines the following: 
(a)  That the granting of such special exception will be consistent with the area's turn-of-the century small town Texas character in size, shape, style, color and content; 
(b)  The wall sign is placed on a single tenant building with a minimum floor area of 4,000 square feet; 
(c)  The maximum wall sign area authorized is 100 square feet; 
(d)  The maximum number of wall signs with an area increase allowed is two per building, meeting the criteria of division (A)(6)(b) above; and 
(e)  Any conditions that will secure substantially the purpose and intent of this section. 
(8)  To authorize a special exception allowing a wall sign to be on a separate building or wall on the same premises from where the business has a certificate of occupancy. 
(9)  Meritorious exceptions. In the development of these criteria, a primary objective has been ensuring against the kind of signage that has led to low visual quality. On the other hand, an equally primary objective has been guarding against signage over-control. It is not the intention of these criteria to discourage innovation. It is entirely conceivable that signage proposals could be made that, while clearly nonconforming to this chapter, and thus not allowable under these criteria, have obvious merit in not only being appropriate to the particular site or location, but also in making a positive contribution to the visual environment. Such proposals will be seriously and fairly considered by the Board of Adjustment. 
(B)  No variance may be granted if the granting of that variance will create an unnecessary hardship upon another parcel of land. The Board is not authorized to grant a variance of the zone in which a sign is permitted. In order to make a finding of hardship and to grant a variance, the Board shall find: 
(1)  The requested variance does not eliminate any requirement of this code and does not allow any prohibited signs or acts. 
(2)  The hardship is not in any way the result of the applicant's own action. 
(3)  The hardship is peculiar to the property of the applicant and not due to the general conditions of the neighborhood. Economic gain or loss shall never be sufficient grounds for the finding of a hardship or the granting of a variance.

(A)  A person wanting to engage in and/or operate in gas production activities shall apply for and obtain a gas well permit under this chapter. It shall be unlawful for any person acting either for himself or acting as an agent, employee, independent contractor, or servant for any person to drill any well, assist in any way with the site preparation, reworking, fracturing or operation of any such well or to conduct an activity related to the production of gas without first obtaining a gas well permit issued by the city in accordance with this chapter. Such activities include, but are not limited to, drilling, working, re-drilling, re-working, initial site preparation, operation, construction of rigs or tank batteries, fracturing and pressurizing. 
(B)  The operator must apply for and obtain a gas well permit for the drilling, re-drilling, deepening, re-entering, activating or converting of each well. The operator shall neither apply for, nor obtain a "blanket" permit for more than one well if multiple wells are located on the same tract of land. Each new well established at the ground surface will be considered a new gas well permit. 
(C)  An existing gas well permit shall not constitute authority for the re-entering and drilling of an abandoned well. An operator shall obtain a new well permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter if the operator is re-entering and drilling an abandoned well. 
(D)  When a gas well permit has been issued to the operator for the drilling, reentering, activating or converting of a well, such gas well permit shall constitute sufficient authority for drilling operation, production gathering or production maintenance, repair, re-working, testing, plugging and abandonment of the well and/or any other activity associated with mineral exploration at the site of such well. An amended gas well permit shall be obtained before such well may be modified for purposes of re-drilling, deepening or converting such well to a depth or use other than that set forth in the then current permit for such well. 
(E)  Any person who intends to re-work a permitted well using a drilling rig, to fracture stimulate a permitted well after initial completion, shall give written notice to the City Manager or his designee no less than ten days before the activities begin. The notice must identify where the activities will be conducted and must describe the activities in detail, including, but not limited to, whether explosive charges will be used, the duration of the activities and the time the activities will be conducted. The notice must also provide the address and 24-hour telephone number of the person conducting the activities. The person conducting the activities shall post a sign on the property giving the public notice 48 hours in advance of the fracturing activities. The sign shall comply with the requirements of section 157.20, "On-site technical regulations." 
(F)  The gas well permits required by this section are in addition to and are not in lieu of any permit which may be required by any other provision of the City Code or by any other governmental agency.

(J)  No gas well permit shall be issued for any well to be drilled within the floodway identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on the most current Federal Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Gas wells proposed in the floodplain, but outside the floodway, shall comply with the requirements for development in the Stormwater and Flood Protection Ordinance and all other applicable city codes. 
(K)  No gas well permit shall be issued for any well to be drilled that is not in compliance with any standard, provision, procedure, and/or recommendation as described in the city's general design standards. 
(L)  By acceptance of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter, the operator expressly stipulates and agrees to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this section.

Evidence of the execution of a letter of credit shall be submitted to the city by submitting an original signed letter of credit from the banking institution, with a copy of the same provided to the City Secretary. 
(G)  The principal amount of any security instrument shall be $50,000.00 for any single well. If, after completion of a well, the applicant/operator, who initially posted a $50,000.00 bond, has complied with all of the provisions of this section and whose well is in the producing stage and all drilling operations have ceased, may submit a request to the City Manager or his designee to reduce the existing bond to $15,000.00 for the remainder of the time the well produces without reworking. During reworking operations, the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be maintained at $50,000.00. If at any time after no less than a 15-day written notice to the operator and a public hearing, the City Council shall deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, it may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum of $250,000.00 per well. 
(H)  Whenever the City Manager or his designee finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this section, a written notice shall be given to the operator. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the City Manager or his designee to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. After receipt of such notice, the operator shall within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay over to the city 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing work as set forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than 30 days unless the failure presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this chapter. The city shall be authorized to draw against any irrevocable letter of credit or bond to recover such amount due to the operator. Upon receipt of such monies, the city shall proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred other than for the expenditure of said sum in hand. In the event that the well has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the Commission, such additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly plug and abandoned the well and restore the drill site in conformity with the regulations of this section. 
(I)  In the event the operator does not cause the work to be performed and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable irrevocable letter of credit or bond the city may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action against the operator, or by criminal action against the operator, or by both such methods. 
(J)  When the well or wells covered by said irrevocable letter of credit or bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this section, and in conformity with all regulations of the Commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and cancelled.

If the City Manager, in his opinion, believes that danger to persons and property exists because of such loss of well control and that the operator is not taking or is unable to take all reasonable and necessary steps to regain control of such well, the city may then employ any well control expert or experts or other contactors or suppliers of special services, or may incur any other expenses for labor and material which the city deems necessary to regain control of such well. The city shall then have a valid lien against the interest in the well of all working interest owners to secure payment of any expenditure made by the city pursuant to such action of the City Manager or his designee in gaining control of said well. 
(B)  Cleanup after spills, leaks and malfunctions. After any spill, leak or malfunction, the operator shall remove or cause to be removed to the satisfaction of the Fire Department and the City Manager or his designee all waste materials from any public or private property affected by such spill, leak or malfunction. Cleanup operations must begin immediately. If the owner fails to begin site cleanup within 24 hours, the city shall have the right to contact the Commission in order to facilitate the removal of all waste materials from the property affected by such spill, leak or malfunction. 
(C)  Cleanup after well servicing. After the well has been completed or plugged and abandoned, the operator shall clean the drill site or operation site, complete restoration activities and repair all damage to public property cause by such operations within 60 days. 
(D)  Painting. All production equipment shall be painted and maintained at all times, including wellheads, pumping units, tanks, and buildings or structures. When requiring maintainance of such facilities, the City Manager or his designee shall consider the deterioration of the quality of the material of which such facility or structure is constructed, the degree of rust, and its appearance. Paint shall be of a neutral color, compatible with surrounding uses. Neutral colors shall include sand, gray and unobtrusive shades of green, blue and brown, or other neutral colors approved by the Urban Development Department.

GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 171.00. - Purpose and policy. 
    To protect human health and the environment, this chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) for the City of Carrollton and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code  1251 et seq.), the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 403), and the State Pretreatment Regulations as adopted in 30 TAC, Chapter 315. This chapter continues, with some revisions, the pretreatment program established by the city in the 1965 Code of Ordinances. The objectives of this chapter are: 
(A)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works that will interfere with its operation, or contribute to biological impairment of the publicly owned treatment works; 
(B)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment works, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the publicly owned treatment works; 
(C)  To ensure the quality of treatment plant sludge to allow its use and disposal in compliance with statutes and regulations; 
(D)  To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel, who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment, and the safety, health and welfare of the general public; 
(E)  To promote pollution prevention, waste minimization and the reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge from users and the publicly owned treatment works; 
(F)  To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned treatment works; and 
(G)  To enable the Control Authority to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is subject. 
    This chapter shall apply to all users of the publicly owned treatment works. The chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.

(A)  A user who violates any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction is punishable as set forth in section 10.99, for each day or part of a day during which the violation is committed, continued, or permitted. 
(B)  A user who introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction is punishable as set forth in section 10.99. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(C)  A user who makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction is punishable as set forth in section 10.99. 
(D)  Any person who negligently, willfully or maliciously causes loss by tampering with or destroying the POTW, a user's treatment facilities, or any sampling and inspection equipment is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction is punishable as set forth in section 10.99. 
(E)  In addition to sanctions provided in this chapter, the city is entitled to exercise sanctions provided for by the other ordinances of the city for failure to pay the charges for water and sanitary sewer service when due. 
(F)  Criminal responsibility. A culpable mental state is not required to prove an offense under this chapter. A person is criminally responsible for a violation of this chapter if: 
(1)  The person commits or assists in the commission of a violation, or causes or permits another person to commit a violation; or 
(2)  The person owns or manages the property or facilities determined to be the cause of the illegal discharge. 
(Ord. 2768, passed 2-4-03) 
Sec. 171.57. - Remedies nonexclusive. 
(A)  The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The DCO may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. 
(B)  Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the DCO may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. 
(C)  Further, the DCO is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. 2768, passed 2-4-03) 
Sec. 171.58. - Applicability of more stringent regulations. 
(A)  If national pretreatment standards, categorical or otherwise, more stringent than the discharge limits prescribed under this chapter are promulgated by the EPA for certain industries, the more stringent national pretreatment standards will apply to the affected user. A violation of the more stringent national pretreatment standards will also be considered a violation of this chapter. 
(B)  A user within the city who discharges industrial waste ultimately received and treated by another governmental entity pursuant to a wholesale wastewater contract, or a reciprocal agreement with the city, is subject to the following additional rules: 
(1)  If the governmental entity has more stringent discharge limits than those prescribed by this chapter, or by a discharge permit issued hereunder, because the EPA or TCEQ requires the more stringent discharge limits as part of the governmental entity's wastewater pretreatment program, the more stringent discharge limits shall prevail. 
(2)  The DCO is authorized to issue a discharge permit to a user affected by division (1), to insure notice of and compliance with the more stringent discharge limits. If the user already has a discharge permit, the DCO may amend the permit to apply and enforce the more stringent discharge limits. A user shall submit to the DCO an expected compliance date and an installation schedule, if the more stringent discharge limits necessitate technological or mechanical adjustments to discharge facilities or plant processes. 
(3)  If the DCO chooses not to issue or amend a permit under division (2), the DCO shall notify the affected user in writing of the more stringent discharge limits and their effective date. Regardless of whether or not a permit is issued or amended, a user shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comply with the more stringent discharge limits. 
(4)  The more stringent discharge limits cease to apply upon termination of the city's wholesale wastewater contract or reciprocal agreement with the governmental entity, or upon modification or elimination of the limits by the government entity or the EPA. The DCO shall take the appropriate action to notify the affected user of an occurrence under this division (4). 
(C)  Variances in compliance dates. The DCO may grant a variance in compliance dates to a user when, in the DCO's opinion, such action is necessary to achieve pretreatment or corrective measures. In no case shall the DCO grant a variance in compliance dates to a user affected by national categorical pretreatment standards beyond the compliance dates established by the EPA. 
(D)  Authority to regulate. The DCO may establish policies and regulations, not in conflict with this chapter or other laws, to control the disposal and discharge of waste into the wastewater system, and to insure compliance with the city's pretreatment enforcement program with all applicable pretreatment regulations promulgated by the EPA. The policies and regulations established shall, where applicable, be made part of any discharge permit issued to a user by the DCO. 
(Ord. 2768, passed 2-4-03) 
PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES 

Sec. 171.59. - Pretreatment charges and fees. 
(A)  Users are required to pay applicable pretreatment charges and costs for: 
(1)  Preparing and submitting baseline monitoring reports and construction plans, revising permit applications, required self-monitoring and reporting, and other reports or information required by the DCO; 
(2)  Installation and operation of pretreatment facilities and other requirements pursuant to this chapter, that are the responsibility of the user; 
(3)  Treating abnormal strength wastes (surcharges); 
(4)  Disconnection and/or reconnection of service resulting from noncompliance; 
(5)  Costs to the city or TRA incurred from an upset, bypass or unauthorized discharge; 
(6)  Recovery of the costs to the city or TRA for filing appeals; and, 
(7)  Costs incurred by the city under administrative enforcement remedies in this chapter, including abatement and remediation expenses. 
(B)  The city may require reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program, which are found in this section, and in section 171.53 and subsection 31.01(D), which may include, but are not limited to fees for: 
(1)  Wastewater discharge permits and cost of processing applications for permits; 
(2)  Monitoring, including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
(3)  Inspections and surveillance procedures; 
(4)  Reviewing construction plans, spill control plans and other special criteria: 
(5)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the city. 
(C)  Surcharge. 
(1)  The city may surcharge users for the treating of abnormal strength wastes, either as a single user surcharge or as a class surcharge. 
(2)  The DCO shall have the authority to review and approve the discharge of all water or wastes having high strength concentrations of: 
(a)  A five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) greater than 250 mg/l; or 
(b)  Containing more than 250 mg/l of total suspended solids (TSS); or 
(c)  A chemical oxygen demand (COD) greater than 625 mg/l. 
(3)  Where the DCO has approved the admission of high strength BOD, TSS or COD into the POTW that discharge may be subject to a surcharge as determined by the DCO. The surcharge may be calculated on BOD and TSS values different from the normal concentrations of 250 mg/l, or a COD concentration of 2.5 times that of the BOD concentration. 
(4)  At the discretion of the DCO, users may be surcharged either as: 
(a)  Individual facilities (with flow and concentration data from the single user), or 
(b)  Groups of similar facilities or a class of comparable uses with analogous wastewater characteristics (with flow and concentration data averaged from typical users selected by the DCO). 
(5)  In no case shall a discharge of abnormally elevated conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS or COD) be accepted that will prevent the POTW from meeting its limits, or damage the POTW, or endanger or harm any person. 
(6)  The surcharge will be billed monthly, in addition to the usual monthly sewer service user fees. 
(7)  The surcharge shall be calculated according to the following formula: 
Surcharge = [ Q ] [a (BOD - x) + b (TSS - y)] [8.34] [c] 
Or, for those abnormal wastes having a COD concentration 2.5 or more times that of the BOD concentration, the surcharge may, at the discretion of the DCO, be based on the COD category in lieu of the BOD category. Thus the surcharge shall be calculated according to the following formula: 
Surcharge = [ Q ] [a (COD - z) + b (TSS - y)] [8.34] [c] 
Where: 
Q       = wastewater flow in million gallons per month 8.34       = weight in pounds of one gallon of water (factor for converting mg/l to pounds per million gallons of water) x       = level of BOD in milligrams per liter (mg/l), above which a surcharge is assessed y       = level of TSS in mg/l, above which a surcharge is assessed z       = level of COD in mg/l, above which a surcharge is assessed a       = unit cost in dollars, of treatment per pound of BOD or COD b       = unit cost in dollars, of treatment per pound of TSS c       = administrative overhead recovery factor in dollars BOD       = measured amount of BOD, in mg/l COD       = measured amount of COD, in mg/l TSS       = measured amount of TSS, in mg/l  
and, where the value of BOD, COD and/or TSS concentrations in this calculation will be an average of values determined by testing procedures, as defined in this chapter, on samples collected and/or accepted by the DCO. If the average of these concentrations is less than the value for the respective x, y or z, that term of the equation shall be dropped from the surcharge calculation. 
(8)  The DCO may adjust the administrative recovery factor and the unit treatment costs in the formula to reflect increases or decreases in overhead and wastewater treatment costs. 
(9)  Based on sampling analysis, adjustment in surcharges shall be made to reflect changes in the characteristics of the abnormal strength wastewater. Changes in charges shall continue for at least six billing periods, unless subsequent tests determine that the charge should be further increased. 
(10)  A surcharge is an additional charge by the city for the increased cost of handling discharge of unusual strength and character, and shall not serve as a variance to the requirements of this chapter. Exercise of this provision shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. 2768, passed 2-4-03) 
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 

Sec. 171.60. - In an action brought in federal court only: Upset provision. 
(A)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(B)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (C), below, are met. 
(C)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the DCO within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
(a)  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(b)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(c)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(D)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(E)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(F)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. 3281, passed 2-3-09) 
Sec. 171.61. - In an action brought in municipal court or state court only: Act of God provision. 
(A)  An event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe is not a violation. 
(B)  In an enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. 
(C)  In the event that subsections (A) and (B) above have been demonstrated the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(Ord. 3281, passed 2-3-09) 
Sec. 171.62. - Bypass. 
(A)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means damage which can reasonably be expected to occur if the user did not elect to perform the bypass. Such impairment would be: 
(a)  Substantial physical damage to property; 
(b)  Damage to the user's treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable; or 
(c)  Substantial and permanent loss of natural resources. 
"Severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(B)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (C) and (D) of this section. 
(C)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the DCO, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the DCO of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The DCO may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(D)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the DCO may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(a)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(b)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(c)  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C) of this section. 
(2)  The DCO may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the DCO determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (D)(1) of this section. 
(Ord. 3281, passed 2-3-09) 
Secs. 171.63-171.98. - Reserved. 
Sec. 171.99. - Penalty. 
(A)  A person who violates any provisions of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction is punishable as set forth in section 10.99, for each act of violation and for each day or part of a day during which the violation is committed, continued or permitted. 
(B)  In addition to sanctions provided above, the city is entitled to pursue all other criminal and civil remedies to which it is entitled under authority of this chapter, other ordinances or statutes, against a person continuing prohibited discharges or violating any provision of this chapter. 
(C)  In addition to sanctions provided above, the city is entitled to exercise sanctions provided for by the other ordinances of the city for failure to pay the bill for water and sanitary sewer service when due.

Such best management practices may include, but not be limited to, the following measures: 
(1)  Ensuring that existing vegetation is preserved where feasible and that disturbed portions of the site are stabilized as soon as practicable in portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or permanently ceased. Stabilization measures may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, geotextiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, protection of trees, preservation of mature vegetation, and other appropriate measures; 
(2)  Use of structural practices to divert flows from exposed soils, store flows, or otherwise limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from the site to the maximum extent practicable; 
(3)  Minimization of the tracking of sediments off-site by vehicles, the generation of dust, and the escape of other windblown waste from the site; 
(4)  Prevention of the discharge of building materials, including cement, lime, concrete, asphalt and mortar, to the MS4, surface water in the state or the waters of the U.S.; 
(5)  General good housekeeping measures to prevent and contain spills of paints, solvents, fuels, septic waste, and other hazardous chemicals and pollutants associated with construction, and to assure proper cleanup and disposal of any such spills in compliance with state, federal, and local requirements; 
(6)  Implementation of proper waste disposal and waste management techniques, including covering waste materials, minimizing ground contact with hazardous chemicals and trash, and installing and maintaining covered receptacles for rubbish and garbage to assure that such waste materials are not blown or carried by rainfall runoff from the site; 
(7)  Timely maintenance of vegetation, erosion and sediment control measures, and other best management practices to maintain them in good and effective operating condition; and 
(8)  Installation of structural measures during the construction process to control pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed. Structural measures may include, but not be limited to, the following: stormwater detention structures (including wet ponds); stormwater retention structures; flow attenuation by use of open vegetative swales and natural depressions; other velocity dissipation devices; infiltration of runoff on site; and sequential systems which combine several practices. Operators of construction sites are responsible for the installation and maintenance of stormwater management measures prior to final stabilization of the site, and for a period of two years after final acceptance by the city, unless the area is disturbed by new owners. 
(9)  The current owner(s) of the property is responsible for the maintenance of the permanent stabilization structures listed above in subsection 173.07(A)(8) to ensure proper operation, water quality protection and flood control. 
(10)  Installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment controls. 
(B)  Qualified personnel (provided by the operator of the construction site) must inspect disturbed areas of any construction site that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every 14 calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm event that is 0.5 inches or greater. Inspections may be performed once every seven calendar days, on a specifically defined day, regardless of whether or not there has been a rainfall event. All erosion and sediment control measures and other identified best management practices must be observed in order to ensure that they are operating correctly and are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters and the MS4. Based on the results of the inspection, best management practices must be modified as appropriate, and as soon as is practicable.

Sec. 173.08. - One acre or greater land disturbances and post-construction regulations. 
(A)  One acre or greater land disturbances. All operators of sites of construction activity, including clearing, grading, excavation, demolitions, and land filling activities, that result in the disturbance of one or more acres of total land area, or that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale within which one or more acres of total land area are disturbed, and who are required to obtain a TPDES permit for stormwater discharges associated with construction activity, must comply with the following requirements (in addition to those in section 173.08): 
(1)  All operators must obtain coverage for stormwater discharges from a construction site under the TPDES general permit, must post a signed copy of its construction site notice (CSN) on the construction site prior to the commencement of construction activities. The notices required to be posted will depend on the size of the construction project and is explained in the TPDES general permit for construction activities. The CSN must be posted in a location where it is safely and readily available for viewing by the general public, local, state, and federal authorities. For large construction sites, a signed copy of the NOI and CSN from all operators must be submitted to the DCO seven days prior to the commencement of construction activities. For small construction sites, a signed copy of the CSN from all operators must be submitted to the DCO at least two days prior to the commencement of construction activities. 
(2)  A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) must be prepared and implemented in accordance with the requirements of the TPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the construction site, and in accordance with any additional requirements imposed by or under this ordinance and any other city ordinance. 
(3)  The SWPPP must be completed and implemented prior to the beginning of construction activities. The SWPPP must be updated and modified as required by the TPDES permit and this ordinance. 
(4)  The operator must submit the SWPPP and any modifications thereto to the DCO for review prior to commencement of construction activity at the site. 
(5)  If upon the DCO's review of the SWPPP (or any modification to the SWPPP) and any site inspection that the DCO may conduct, the DCO determines that the SWPPP does not comply with the requirements of the TPDES permit issued for stormwater discharge from the construction site, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this ordinance, the DCO may issue an order prohibiting the commencement or the continuation of any construction activity at the site. Also, if at any time the DCO determines that the SWPPP is not being fully implemented the DCO may similarly issue an order prohibiting the continuation of any construction activity at the site. 
(6)  Upon review of the SWPPP and any site inspection that is conducted, the DCO may deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, on the grounds that the SWPPP does not comply with the requirements of the permit issued for stormwater discharge from the construction site, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this ordinance. Also, if at any time the DCO determines that the SWPPP is not being fully implemented, the DCO may similarly deny approval of any building permit, grading permit or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, at the site. 
(7)  All operators identified in the SWPPP must sign a copy of the following certification statement before conducting any professional service identified in the SWPPP: 
I certify under penalty of law that I understand the terms and conditions of the Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES) permit and any modification by the State of Texas that authorizes the stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity from the construction site identified as part of this certification, the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Ordinance or the City of Carrollton, and those provisions of the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) for the construction site for which I am responsible. 
The certification must include the name and title of the person providing the signature; the name, address, and telephone number of the contracting firm; the address (or other identifying description) of the site; and the date the certification is made. 
(8)  The SWPPP and the certifications of all operators required by section 173.08(A)(7), and with any modifications attached, must be retained at the construction site from the date of commencement of construction through the date of final stabilization. 
(9)  The operator must make a copy of the SWPPP and any modification thereto available to the DCO at the construction site upon request. 
(10)  The DCO may notify the operator at any time that the SWPPP does not meet the requirements of the TPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the construction site, or any additional requirement imposed by or under this ordinance. Such notification must identify those provisions of the permit or ordinance which arc not being met by the SWPPP, and identify which provisions of the SWPPP require modifications in order to meet such requirements. Within seven calendar days of such notification from the DCO (or as otherwise provided by the DCO), the operator must make the required changes to the SWPPP and submit to the DCO a written certification that the requested modifications have been made. 
(11)  The operator must modify the SWPPP whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4, or surface water in the state, or the waters of the U.S., or if the SWPPP proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges associated with construction activity. 
(12)  Qualified personnel (provided by the operator) must inspect at least once every 14 calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of any rain event that is 0.5 inches or greater: disturbed areas of the construction site that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site. Inspections may be performed once every seven calendar days, on a specifically defined day, regardless of whether or not there has been a rainfall event. Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation must be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system. Erosion and sediment control measures and best management practices must be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they must be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters and the MS4. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site must be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking. 
(13)  All protective measures in the SWPPP must be maintained in effective operating condition. If, through inspections or other means, the operator determines that BMPs are not operating effectively, then the operator shall perform maintenance as necessary to maintain the continued effectiveness of stormwater controls, prior to the next rain event if feasible. If maintenance prior to the next anticipated rain event is impracticable, the reason shall be documented in the SWPPP and maintenance must be scheduled and accomplished as soon as practicable, but in no case later than seven calendar days following the inspection. Erosion and sediment controls that have been intentionally disabled, run over, removed, or otherwise rendered ineffective must be replaced or corrected immediately upon discovery. 
(14)  A report summarizing the scope of any inspection required by section 173.08(12) and the name(s) and qualifications of personnel making the inspection, the date(s) of the inspection, major observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP, and actions taken in accordance with appropriate plan revisions must be made and retained as part of the SWPPP. The report must identify any incidence of noncompliance; or if the report does not identify any incidence of noncompliance, the report must contain a certification that the facility is in compliance with the SWPPP, the TPDES permit, and this ordinance. The report must be signed by the person responsible for making it. 
(15)  The operator must retain copies of any SWPPP and all reports required by this ordinance or by the TPDES permit for the site, for a period of at least three years from the date that the site is finally stabilized, and the required CSN or notice of termination (NOT) has been submitted. Such plans, reports and records must be made available to the DCO upon request. 
(16)  Where a site has been finally stabilized and all stormwater discharges from construction activities that are authorized by this ordinance and by the TPDES permit are eliminated, or where the operator of all stormwater discharges from the construction site changes, the operator of the construction site must submit to the DCO a copy of the CSN or NOT as required by the TPDES construction general permit. 
(17)  The city may withhold an occupancy permit for any premises constructed on the site until such certification of final stabilization has been filed and the DCO has determined, following any appropriate inspection, that final stabilization has in fact occurred, that any required permanent structural controls have been completed and all temporary controls have been removed. 
(B)  Post-construction requirements. 
(1)  The owner or operator must ensure all temporary control measures for erosion control or other BMPs are removed once final stabilization has been achieved. 
(2)  The owner or operator must ensure all long-term operation and maintenance of post-construction stormwater runoff control mechanisms, such as detention and retention basins, dry wells, and other measures.

ARTICLE III.
ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
The district boundary lines shown on the Official Zoning Map are usually along streets, alleys, property lines or extensions thereof. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
1. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines;
2. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines;
3. Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following city limits;
4. Boundaries indicated as approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to be the centerline of the right-of-way, or if no centerline is established, the boundary shall be interpreted to be the mid-point between right-of-way lines;
5. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines. In the event of a change in the shoreline, the zoning district boundary shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines;
6. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in paragraphs 1 through 5 of this Article shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the Map;
7. Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action of the City Council, or whenever such area is franchised for building purposes, the zoning district line adjoining each side of such street, alley or other public way shall be automatically extended to the centerline of such vacated street, alley or public way, and all area so involved shall then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended districts;
8. In the case of a district boundary line(s) dividing a platted lot into two (2) or more parts, and in the absence of a specific legal description which delineates by ordinance such district boundary line(s), the district boundary line shall be construed to be the property line nearest the less restrictive district such that the development standards of the more restrictive district shall apply to the entire platted lot;
9. Where physical features on the ground are at variance with the information shown on the Official Zoning Map, or when there arises a question as to how or whether a parcel of property is zoned and such question cannot be resolved by the application of paragraphs 1 through 8 of this Article, the matter shall be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission to interpret the intent of the Official Zoning Map. The Commission's decision on such matter shall be final.

NEWLY ANNEXED OR UNPLATTED PROPERTY
SECTION A. NEWLY ANNEXED PROPERTY.
All property annexed into the City of Carrollton after the effective date of this ordinance shall be temporarily zoned to the (IH) Interim Holding District until such property is permanently zoned by the City Council.

3. In the event the Planning and Zoning Commission holds a hearing on any proposed annexation, it may, at its discretion, at the same time hold a hearing upon the permanent zoning that is to be given to the area or tract to be annexed, and make a recommendation on both matters to the City Council so that the City Council can, if it so desires, act on the matter of permanent zoning and annexation at the same time.

2. No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space required about or in connection with any structure or use for the purpose of complying with this ordinance shall be included as part of a yard, open space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other structure or use.
3. Every structure hereafter erected or altered shall be located on an official lot of record as herein defined.
SECTION B. NEW AND UNLISTED USES.
1. Because of the large number of economic activities within the national economy, some uses have been identified herein under the broad heading of its relevant economic activity. For such uses that may not be specifically listed herein, reference shall be made to Part I of the North American Industry Classification System, United States, 2017 edition, for an interpretation. Article XXXIV Definitions for uses listed herein override the North American Industrial Classification System descriptions. (Ord. No. 1670, 11/20/90); (Ord. No. 3331, 10/06/09)
It is recognized, however, that new types of land uses will develop, and forms of land use not currently anticipated may, from time to time, seek to locate within the City of Carrollton that are not listed within the North American Industry Classification System or not defined in Article XXXIV. In order to provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use shall be made as follows:
(Ord. No. 3331, 10/06/09)
a. The City Manager or Designee shall refer the question concerning any new or unlisted land use to the Planning and Zoning Commission, requesting an interpretation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. The referral of the use interpretation question shall be accompanied by a statement of facts listing the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity, sales, processing, type of product, storage, and the amount and nature thereof, enclosed or open storage, anticipated employment, transportation requirements, the amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material and vibration likely to be generated, and the general requirements for public utilities, such as water and sanitary sewer.
b. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the nature and described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the other uses permitted in the various districts and determine the zoning district or districts within which such use should be located.
ART. V USE OF LAND AND STRUCTURES

d.The text of this ordinance shall be amended in accordance with the determination of the CityCouncil, as prescribed in Article XXXI of this ordinance. Such text amendment may be initiatedsubsequent to, or concurrent with, the procedures stated in paragraphs (a) through (c) above.
SECTION C. USE MATRIX.
Land and structures in each of the zoning districts may be used for any of the indicated uses, but no land shall hereafter be used, and no building or structure shall hereafter be erected, altered, converted, arranged, designed, or used for other than those uses specified as permitted uses in the district in which it is located, according to the Use Matrix, and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Articles of this ordinance.
In some instances, planned developments of special use permits have been approved which provide a list of allowable uses in the amending ordinance whereby the unique numerical use code utilized in conjunction with this Article has been included in the amending ordinance. From time to time the numerical codes in this Article may be amended. Where the numerical use code contained in this ordinance creating the planned development district or special use permit is different for a particular use from the use code contained in this Article for the same use, such use shall remain valid as an allowed use to the extent permitted by the applicable planned development or special use permit ordinance. Provided, however, that such numerical use code contained in the planned development or special use permit ordinance shall become void, and have no bearing on the application of the provisions of the planned development or special use permit ordinance.

ART. VI (IH) INTERIM HOLDING DISTRICT
CARROLLTON COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE 6 - 1
Updated January 2019
ARTICLE VI.
(IH) INTERIM HOLDING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
SECTION A. PURPOSE.
1. The (IH) Interim Holding District is intended to promote orderly, timely, economical growth, and to recognize current land use conditions.
2. The (IH) Interim Holding District is to be used as a temporary classification for land that is annexed into the City of Carrollton.
3. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall initiate proceedings on its own motion as soon as practicable to give newly annexed territory a permanent zoning designation.
4. Land shall not remain in the (IH) Interim Holding District permanently, except under the following conditions:
a. This district may be used as a reserve area in which the future growth of the city might occur. This zoning district is suitable for areas where development is premature because of a lack of adequate utilities, capacity, or service, or where the ultimate land use has not been determined;
b. This district may be used to protect and provide open space buffers around those areas that are unsuitable for development because of physical constraints (such as flooding) that pose potential health, environmental, or safety hazards. The use of the land shall be permanently restricted to those uses prescribed herein until such time as the property is shown to be suitable for development and is zoned to a different zoning classification.
SECTION B. PRINCIPAL USES.
No land shall be used and no structure shall be erected for, converted to, or used for any principal use other than such uses as are allowed in the (IH) Interim Holding District, in accordance with Article V of this ordinance. (Ord. No. 1705, 05/07/91)
SECTION C. ACCESSORY USES.
No land shall be used and no structure shall be erected for, converted to, or used for any accessory use other than such uses as are allowed in the (IH) Interim Holding District, in accordance with Article V of this ordinance. (Ord. No. 1705, 05/07/91)

The following additional use shall be allowed in the (IH) Interim Holding District only upon approval of a Special Use Permit in accordance with Article XXI of this ordinance:
1. One single-family detached structure, and permitted accessory uses, located on a parcel of land of less than five acres in size; provided that such parcel has not been created by subdivision plat or metes and bounds conveyance subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance, or the date of annexation of such parcel, whichever is later. (Ord. No. 1705, 05/07/91)
SECTION E. PROHIBITED USES.
The following uses shall be specifically prohibited in the (IH) Interim Holding District:
1. Any structure erected or land used for other than one or more of the uses specifically permitted pursuant to this Article and Article V of this ordinance;

3. The storage of equipment, material or vehicles, including abandoned vehicles, which are not necessary to the uses permitted in this district. (Ord. No. 1705, 05/07/91)
SECTION F. SPECIAL HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
1. Flagpoles, roof gables, chimneys, communication equipment, and vent stacks may extend for an additional height not to exceed 15 feet from the maximum height limit of a structure to the highest point of any flagpole, roof gable, chimney or vent stack.
2. The height of the church steeples, domes and spires may extend an additional height not to exceed twice the height of the main building and shall be set back from any adjacent residentially zoned property line at a minimum distance equal to the total height of the steeple, dome or spire. Church steeples, domes and spires shall be permitted to be placed on the main buildings. This provision for an additional height in excess of the maximum height requirements shall be permitted for maximum of one steeple, dome or spire per lot, tract or project.

facilities of a church, synagogue or temple, exclusive of the main sanctuary, such as a gymnasium or classroom building, may be erected to exceed 25 feet in height, as such building height is determined pursuant to Article XXXIV of this ordinance, provided that one additional foot shall be added to the front, rear and side yard setback requirements for each foot that such structures exceed 25 feet in height. Such structures shall not exceed 36 feet in height, except as provided in Section F(1) hereinabove.
The requirements established herein for additional setbacks shall not apply to the sanctuary building of a church, synagogue or temple which is in excess of 25 feet in height. (Ord. No. 2572, 11/07/00)
SECTION G. SPECIAL YARD REGULATIONS.
1. SPECIAL FRONT YARD REGULATIONS:

Updated January 2019
SECTION H. IRREGULAR SHAPED LOTS:
Irregular or pie shaped lots or parcels, or any lot or parcel located on an "eyebrow", cul-de-sac or curved portion of a street, may be required to demonstrate on a subdivision plat submitted for approval the ability to accommodate a building envelope for a structure meeting the minimum floor area as required herein. Such building envelope shall be established consistent with all required setback lines, which shall be computed inclusive of any easements which may exist on the lot or parcel. It is the intent of this paragraph to ensure that adequate area exists to allow proper placement of a structure on any irregular or pie shaped lot or parcel, or any lot or parcel located on an "eyebrow", cul-de-sac or curved portion of a street.
(Reference Figure 1.2, Appendix A)
SECTION I. SIDEWALKS.
Sidewalks shall be provided in accordance with the Subdivision Ordinance, and shall be constructed in accordance with the standards prescribed by the City of Carrollton. (Ord. No. 1947, 10/19/93)
SECTION J. SPECIAL OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
1. A private garage shall be rear or side entry. The front face of a garage, which shall be defined as that portion of the garage used for vehicular access, shall not directly face a public street, unless otherwise specifically approved by the City Council. A garage may be allowed to face a public street, however, provided:
a. That such garage is located behind the main structure or residence; or
b. That the main structure is located on a lot within a subdivision for which an approved plat was filed with the appropriate county clerk prior to July 19, 1988, and where such subdivision plat did not provide for the direct access of the lot to an alley (Ord. No. 1947, 10/19/93); or
c. That natural physical features preclude the establishment of a side or rear entry garage, or the placement of the garage behind the main structure or residence. Such determination shall be made by action of the City Council.
SECTION K. MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS.

SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS
SECTION A. PURPOSE.
1. The (SF) Single-Family Residential Districts are intended to be comprised of single-family detached dwellings, together with public or denominational schools, churches, and public parks to create basic neighborhood units where the combination of these uses is appropriate.
2. The (SF) Single-Family Residential Districts are intended for areas that are properly buffered and protected from non-residential uses, pollution and environmental hazards, or from high volumes of traffic.
3. The (SF-6.5/12 and SF-5/12) Single-Family Residential Districts are intended primarily to support development in transitional or in-fill areas of the city, as such areas may be determined suitable on a case by case basis upon review by the City Council. (Ord. No. 1557, 07/11/89); (Ord. No. 2400, 12/15/98)
4. The (SF-PH) Single-Family Patio Home District is intended to provide for detached, zero-lot-line, development in areas where physical conditions may warrant higher density single-family development. The District encourages the main structure to be constructed coincident with one side property line for internal lots. The District encourages only one side yard setback for internal lots in order to maximize lot usage, by creating a usable open living area on the side of the lot, while maintaining a neighborhood character consistent with conventional single-family detached homes. (Ord. No. 2016, 09/06/94)
5. Institutional Uses should not route traffic through lower density residential areas, and should be located on sites that have direct access to arterial or collector size streets capable of carrying the additional traffic they will generate.

MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
SECTION A. PURPOSE.
1. The (MF-12, MF-15, MF-18) Multi-Family Residential Districts are established to provide adequate space and site diversification for higher density residential development.
2. These zoning districts permit high density residential development, and should be located where additional requirements for streets, water, sewer, fire protection, drainage, and open space are met. Uses permitted within the (MF-12, MF-15, MF-18) Multi-Family Residential Districts should not route traffic through lower density residential areas, and should be located on sites that have direct access to arterial or collector size streets capable of carrying the additional traffic they will generate.
3. Multi-family residential uses may serve as a transition between single-family and commercial or industrial uses, yet should be properly buffered from non-residential land uses and traffic, pollution, and/or environmental hazards.
SECTION B. PRINCIPAL AND ACCESSORY USES.
No land shall be used and no structure shall be erected for, converted to, or used for any principal or accessory use other than such uses as are allowed in any (MF) Multi-Family District, in accordance with Article V of this ordinance.
The following additional uses shall be allowed in any (MF) Multi-Family District:
1. One temporary building used for a real estate sales office only, located on property being sold within a subdivision, upon approval of the City Manager or Designee, for a period not to exceed 180 days. The City Manager or Designee is authorized, however, to approve additional successive 180 day periods of use, provided that such real estate sales office has been in regular and continuous use for the previous 180 day period. At such time as the use of the real estate sales office is terminated, the City Manager or Designee may require its removal from the subdivision. Such real estate sales office shall be maintained at all times;
2. Temporary on-site construction offices and buildings, upon approval of the City Manager or Designee, limited to the period of construction. Such on-site construction offices and buildings shall be maintained at all times;
3. Meeting, party and/or social buildings, laundry facilities, and complex offices, as an accessory use to an apartment complex on the same lot of record;

A technical review and approval of a site plan shall be required, however, by the Planning and Zoning Commission at an advertised public hearing prior to issuance of a building permit. Such site plan is intended to ensure compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and compatibility between the particular use and the neighborhood. The site plan shall be accompanied by a rendition of a typical building elevation, and shall be prepared and submitted in a manner as prescribed by the Planning and Zoning Commission, instructions of which shall be available from the Planning Department.
Where the Planning and Zoning Commission recommends a deviation from the literal application of this ordinance such that more restrictive standards may be required, such standards shall become effective only upon approval of the City Council at an advertised public hearing.

SECTION A. PURPOSE.
1. The (PD) Planned Development District is intended to provide for combining and mixing uses into integral land use units such as industrial parks; industrial, office and commercial centers; residential developments with multiple or mixed housing types; or any appropriate combination of uses which may be planned, developed or operated as integral land use units, whether by a single owner or a combination of owners.
2. After a public hearing has been convened and proper notice to all affected property owners has been made in accordance with Article XXXI of this ordinance, and after a recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission has been submitted, the City Council may authorize the creation of a (PD) Planned Development District on:
a. Residential developments on tracts of five acres or more; or
b. Mixed use developments on tracts of five acres or more; or
c. Developments on tracts of less than five acres when a determination has been made by the Planning and Zoning Commission that the area to be rezoned cannot be rezoned to any other zoning district without creating the potential of adversely affecting adjacent properties.
SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1. PERMITTED USES:
The uses to be permitted in any specific (PD) Planned Development District shall be enumerated in the ordinance which creates such district. Any proposed amendment to the uses permitted within a specific (PD) Planned Development District shall be submitted and processed in accordance with Section E of this Article.

Updated January 2019
ii. Submission of the formal application form for a change of zoning with all required material.
b. Every (PD) Planned Development District approved under the provisions of this Article shall be considered an amendment to the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance and applicable only to the property involved;
c. In carrying out the development of a (PD) Planned Development District, the development conditions and the development schedule shall be complied with.

3. FORMAL PUBLIC HEARING:
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold an advertised public hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXXI of this ordinance.
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make its recommendation to the City Council in accordance with the standard procedures for a change of zoning in the City of Carrollton.

In approving the ordinance establishing the (PD) Planned Development District, the City Council shall, after recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, specify such height, floor area, density, site coverage, setback, landscaping, off-street parking and all other standards as are appropriate for the development which are considered necessary to protect the health, safety, and general welfare, and to create a reasonable transition to, and protection from, property adjacent to the (PD) Planned Development District.
SECTION D. DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE.
1. If the applicant desires, or the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council requires, a development schedule shall be submitted indicating the approximate date on which construction is expected to begin and the rate of anticipated development to completion.

SECTION E. AMENDMENT TO (PD) PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
Any major amendment, supplement, deletion or modification to the (PD) Planned Development District may be granted upon application by any person, group of persons or corporation having a proprietary interest therein. Any application for such amendment, supplement, deletion or modification shall contain the information specified in this Article and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section C of this Article and Article XXXI of this ordinance.

SECTION D. BUILDINGS.
1. INTENT:
It is the intent of this code to create an attractive and active urban style district and the size, disposition, function and design of buildings play an important role in achieving that goal.
a. Buildings should form a strong continuous street wall to define the public street room by creating a ratio of between 1:2.0 and 1:3.0 between the building height and the distance between buildings in the Urban Core and Urban General.
b. Buildings should reflect the history of the City and region in their style and materials.
c. Buildings should directly contribute to the
attractiveness, safety and function of the street and public areas.
d. Buildings should be designed to accommodate a range of uses over time without the need to be destroyed and rebuilt.

ART. XX (TC) TRANSIT CENTER DISTRICT
2. BLOCK FACE:
It is intended that building walls should be continuous along block faces to create a strong edge to the street and contribute to creating an attractive and active pedestrian environment. Contributing to that goal however, is to allow some limited variation and opportunities for such things as outside dining, pocket parks and special building entry features.
a. Block faces shall contain continuous building frontage with the exception of a mid- block access to parking which is no greater than 24 feet in width for vehicular access (additional width dedicated to pedestrian access is permitted) and 16 feet in height. (Ord. 3321, 09/01/09)
Continuous building frontage will be considered to be met if 80 percent or more of the building faade is located at the build-to line. (Ord. 3321, 09/01/09)
b. Facades shall be built parallel to the street frontage, except at street intersections, where a faade containing a primary building entrance may be curved or angled toward the intersection.

ART. XX.1 (CC) CORPORATE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
CARROLLTON COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE 20.1 - 1
Updated February 1, 2020
ARTICLE XX.1.
(CC)
CORPORATE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
(Entire Article Established, Ord. No. 1932, 08/17/93)
SECTION A. PURPOSE AND CONCEPT.
1. The (CC) Corporate Commercial District is intended to establish development standards to promote a high quality, campus-style corporate and business community.
2. The (CC) Corporate Commercial District is intended to promote development which recognizes the importance of physical features and natural amenities in the area. It also includes provisions for private open space that is integrated into the overall site, and development of the property in a manner that, where practical, preserves the drainage ways in their "natural" state.
3. The dominant concept of the (CC) Corporate Commercial District is an open, campus-style setting, characterized by one or more buildings surrounded by a well landscaped area. These buildings should be generally low-rise structures. Courtyards, plazas, hardscape, open grassy areas, berms, trees, impressive entry drives, and unobtrusive parking characterize campus sites. In the campus setting, site density, as measured by floor area ratios (FAR) should be generally low. Parking should generally be surface parking with some use of low-rise parking structures. Landscaping and elevation change should minimize the views of parked cars for both employees and the public.
4. In areas where the physical features and natural amenities do not exist or are limited in nature, the established development standards are intended to provide a similar feel to the site. In those areas of the district where physical constraints limit the ability of campus-style development, mid- and high-rise structures are not inconsistent with the overall concept of the district.
5. While it is not the intent for this to be a retail district, it is recognized that retail and service uses typically play a supporting role to the corporate commercial concept. With this in mind, it is intended, within the (CC) Corporate Commercial District, to encourage limited retail and service uses at centers or nodes within 1,000 feet of major street intersections and within 500 feet of selected minor street intersections. It is also intended to allow for limited retail and service uses within the commercial buildings themselves.
Siting of these structures should be sensitive to visibility and development quality, and orient well to the major streets and adjacent properties. The location of structures should reflect the internalization of activities within the site, reflect consideration of neighboring developments, and vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation.
SECTION B. PRINCIPAL AND ACCESSORY USES.
No land shall be used and no structure shall be erected for, converted to, or used for any principal or accessory use other than such uses that are allowed in the (CC) Corporate Commercial District, in accordance with Article V of this ordinance.

2. No surface parking area shall contain greater than 200 parking spaces. If a greater number of spaces is required, separate parking areas of not more than 200 parking spaces shall be provided. These parking areas shall be separated by a landscaped area with a minimum width of 10 feet, and be landscaped in accordance with Article XXV, Section B(7)(e) of this ordinance and as otherwise provided herein. This landscaped area may be counted towards the on-site required landscaping.
3. Parking reduction options identified in Article XXIV, Section F(2) of this ordinance, shall not be applicable.

ii. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property should be avoided where possible.
iii. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.

v. Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved where possible.

vii. Chemical or physical treatments, such as indiscriminate and careless sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
viii. Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
ix. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction should not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
x. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner
ART. XX.3 HP HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT
CARROLLTON COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE 20.3 - 6
Updated January 2019
that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
b. Demolition
When assessing an application for a Certificate of Historic Appropriateness for demolition, consideration shall be given to the criteria set forth in subsection A above, any criteria set forth in the ordinance establishing the historic designation, and also may include any of the following:

ii. The difficulty or impossibility of reproducing such a building, object, site, or structure due to design, texture, material, detail, or unique location
iii. Whether the building, object, site, or structure is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, city, county, state, or nation

For the purposes of this Section, the base year shall be the year in which the application for the tax exemption was approved by Council. In the event that the structure or the land is assessed during such 10 year period at a lower value than the assessed value for the base year, the Council shall reevaluate the exemption amount for the remainder of the 10 year period.
c. This tax incentive shall only be granted on historic landmark properties or properties located within a designated historic district for the increase in the assessed value of a building/structure and the land necessary for access and use of the building/structure.

If verification of completion shall be deemed unfavorable, the applicant shall be required to complete the renovation and/or restoration in order to secure the tax exemption provided herein. If the verification of completion is favorable, the applicant shall timely provide the appropriate paperwork to the Chief Appraiser of Dallas Central Appraisal District (regardless of which county the property is in) in order to receive the exemption. If the verification of completion is favorable, the Committee shall timely provide written notification to the Tax Assessor-Collector for the City of Carrollton.

4. The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing communications towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing communications towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna;
5. The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing communications towers and structures unsuitable; or,
6. The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of communications towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
vi. Co-Location.
a) Good Faith. Applicants and permittees shall cooperate and exercise good faith in co-locating communications equipment facilities on the same support structures or site, if the City so requests. Good faith shall include sharing technical information to evaluate the feasibility of co-location, and may include negotiations for erection of a replacement support structure to accommodate co-location. A competitive conflict to co-location or financial burden caused by sharing such information normally will not be considered as an excuse to the duty of good faith.
b) Third Party Review. In the event a dispute arises as to whether a permittee has exercised good faith in accommodating other users, the City may require the applicant to obtain a third party technical study at the applicants expense. The City may review any information submitted by the applicant and permittee(s) in determining whether good faith has been exercised.
c) Exceptions. No co-location may be required where the shared use would or does result in significant interference in the broadcast or reception capabilities of the existing communications equipment facilities or failure of the existing communications equipment facilities to meet federal standards for emissions.
d) Violation; Penalty. Failure to comply with co-location requirements when feasible may result in denial of a permit request or revocation of an existing permit.
vii. Removal of an Abandoned Tower and Antennas.
Any tower or antenna that is not operated for a continuous period of 90 days shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such tower or antenna shall remove the same within 90 days of the cessation of operation. Failure to remove an abandoned tower or antenna within said 90 day period shall be grounds to remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. If a communication tower has been determined by the City to have been abandoned, the owner, at their expense, shall remove the structure within 90 days of the notice date.
viii. Pre-Existing Communications Towers.
Pre-existing communications towers shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist, subject to Article XXII Nonconforming Uses and Structures.

LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING
SECTION A. PURPOSE.
(Ord. No. 3498, 06/05/2012); (Ord. 3943, 02/01/20)
The intent of this Article is to:
1. Establish minimum requirements for the installation and maintenance of landscaping and buffering elements and other means of site improvement on developed property to enhance the community's ecological, environmental, and aesthetic qualities, while at the same time allowing for design flexibility.
2. Reduce the negative effects caused by expanses of impervious and non-vegetated surfaces within the urban environment, such as an increase in noise, heat, and glare, and the spread of dust and debris, especially during times of drought.
3. Protect and conserve the community's soils and prevent soil erosion and silting of drainage structures and water bodies, as well as reducing the impact of development on the community's storm drainage system.
4. Preserve and improve the natural and urban environment by recognizing that the use of landscape plantings can purify the air, regenerate oxygen, recharge groundwater, slow and filter storm water runoff, provide wildlife habitat and enhance the aesthetic qualities of the City of Carrollton.
5. Assure an acceptable degree of transition and reduce incompatibility between abutting or nearby uses of differing character by providing visually appealing buffering between such uses.
6. To recognize, conserve, and add to the urban forest as part of the citys natural and green infrastructure.
7. To conserve water and energy.

b. To hear and decide appeals of the City Manager or Designee's interpretation as to the nature or type of use, for the purpose of determining the classification and applicability of the parking standards, appropriate district for the location of such use, or any other regulations of this ordinance as may be applied to such use, and;
c. To hear and decide appeals from the decision of the City Manager or Designee in the enforcement of, and in accordance with, Article XXX, Section G, of this ordinance. (Ord. No. 1844, 11/03/92)

ART. XXXII BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
CARROLLTON COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE 32 - 5
Updated February 1, 2020
contained, authorize special exceptions to this ordinance, limited to the following:
a) The Board may authorize the extension of a height or area regulation into an adjoining district for a distance of not more than 25 feet, where the boundary line of the district divides a lot in single ownership as of the effective date of this ordinance.
b) The Board may authorize the construction of a single-family detached residential structure, and exempt such structure from the minimum required exterior brick or stone content of the district in which such structure is to be located, provided that all of the following can be demonstrated:
1. That more than 50 percent of the total existing single-family detached residential structures located on both sides of the street upon which such structure is to be located, measured from the block's intersecting streets, are not in compliance with the exterior brick or stone requirements of the applicable district, and;
2. That more than 50 percent of the lots on both sides of the street upon which such structure is to be located, measured from the block's intersecting streets, are developed.
c) Where a lot is deemed to have a unique physical hardship regarding the location of a satellite television reception dish ordinance, an alternate location may be authorized by the Board to provide a direct line of sight between such antenna and the orbiting satellites. Alternate installations may include pole-mounted, but not roof-mounted, antennas. The maximum diameter of a satellite television reception dish, as required by this ordinance, shall not be increased.
1. At its discretion the Board may grant permission for alternate installations that would comply with the intent of this ordinance, while taking into account and providing for safeguards regarding the characteristics of the neighboring properties.
2. The following are provided as examples of exceptional cases, and should not be considered an exclusive list.
A) The required area for installation of such antenna has physical interference from structures or foliage located on the same lot or adjacent thereto, such that a direct line of sight between the antenna and the orbiting satellites is prevented, or;
B) The lot or parcel has insufficient area within the side or rear yard, or the location of existing permanent structures, such as a swimming pool, leaves insufficient space for the installation of the antenna within the area required by this ordinance, or;
C) The lot or parcel has its south and/or southwesterly portion(s) located in front of the main building, and foliage or the main building itself would otherwise block reception by the antenna if such antenna were located within the required rear or side yard installation area.
d) The Board may authorize a cumulative height, of the support structure and antenna for an amateur radio station, of greater than 60 feet above the grade at the base of the support structure, where physical constraints are such that effective and reliable radio communications are hindered. The Board may approve such additional height where it
ART. XXXII BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
CARROLLTON COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE 32 - 6
Updated February 1, 2020
finds any one of the following to be applicable:
1. Topographic characteristics of the lot upon which such support structure and antenna are to be located are such that effective and reliable radio communications cannot be conducted if the cumulative height of the support structure and antenna is 60 feet or less above the grade at the base of the support structure. A mean lot elevation of less than 570 feet above mean sea level may be considered as a guideline to determine if a topographic hindrance to effective and reliable radio communications exists; or
2. The proximity of the support structure and antenna to, or height, arrangement or composition of, other permanent structures or apparatus, regardless of whether such structures or apparatus are located on the same lot as the support structure and antenna, are such that effective and reliable radio communications cannot be conducted if the cumulative height of the support structure and antenna is 60 feet or less above the grade at the base of the support structure; or
3. The proximity of the support structure and antenna to any electrical distribution line is such that effective and reliable radio communications cannot be conducted if the cumulative height of the support structure and antenna is 60 feet or less above the grade at the base of the support structure.
e) The Board may authorize a cumulative height, of the support structure and antenna for an amateur radio station, of greater than 60 feet above the grade at the base of the support structure, where a lot is deemed to possess attributes such that radio communications is optimized, and that impacts on surrounding property are negligible. The Board may approve such additional height where it finds all of the following applicable:
1. The support structure and antenna are to be located on a lot of not less than 20,000 square feet in area; and
2. There are no residential dwellings on another lot within 150 feet of the location of the support structure and antenna on the date of the application to the Board for authorization of a special exception.
f) The Board may authorize a support structure for an antenna behind the main building of a lot at a location which is not in accordance with the provisions of Section D(2)(c) of Article XXVIII of the zoning ordinance. The Board may approve such location where it finds any one of the following to be applicable:
1. The location of any permanent structure or apparatus on the lot upon which the support structure and antenna are to be located is such that placement of the support structure and antenna at a location which is in accordance with the provisions of Section D(2)(c) of Article XXVIII of the zoning ordinance is precluded; or
2. The location of the support structure and antenna at a point which is in accordance with the provisions of Section D(2)(c) of Article XXVIII of the zoning ordinance would preclude the location of guy wires and anchors in a manner that would safely secure such support structure. Such determination shall be made relative to the safety specifications of the manufacturer of such support structure, or as certified by a structural engineer registered in the state of Texas that the location of such support
ART. XXXII BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
CARROLLTON COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE 32 - 7
Updated February 1, 2020
structure in accordance with the provisions of Section D(2)(c) of Article XXVIII of the zoning ordinance would pose a hazard to property or occupants of the lot upon which such support structure and antenna are to be located and/or to adjacent property or occupants; or
3. The support structure and antenna are located on a lot of not less than 20,000 square feet in area, and that there are no residential dwellings on another lot within 150 feet of the support structure and antenna on the date of the application to the Board for authorization of a special exception.
g) A request for a special exception relative to subsections (D), (E) or (F) above may not be denied by the Board on the basis of the potential for interference between two radio transmitting stations or between a radio transmitting station and home entertainment equipment or systems. The Federal Communications Commission has sole regulatory authority governing minimum performance standards relative to the interference of home electronic equipment and systems from radio frequency energy.
h) Where a special exception is granted by the Board pursuant to subsection (D), (E) or (F) above, such action shall not nullify, abrogate, modify or otherwise change in any way any safety regulations applicable to such installation, as such safety regulations are established in Article XXVIII of this ordinance.
i) The Board may authorize overhead electrical service, in the (FWY) Freeway District only, to any structure lawfully existing on or before July 18, 1988, which is not currently connected to an electrical utility or service, provided, however, there has been no physical removal of such utility line subsequent to July 18, 1988.

2. That more than 50 percent of the lots on both sides of the street upon which a new dwelling is to be placed, measured from the blocks intersecting streets, are developed. (Ord. No. 2489, 01/18/00)
k) The Board may authorize the placement of solar panels on roofs of homes that are adjacent to arterial thoroughfares, as designated by the adopted Transportation Plan and which are not in accordance with the provisions of Article VII. Section K.8.4.A. The Board may approve such location where is finds the following to be applicable. (Ord. No. 3576, 09/17/13)
1. Panels/modules may be located on an alternate area of the roof if the alternate location increases the estimated annual energy production of the device, as determined by using a publicly available modeling tool provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, by more than 10 percent above the energy production of the device in the most efficient non-alternate location. Complete
ART. XXXII BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
CARROLLTON COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE 32 - 8
Updated February 1, 2020
modeling data and results shall be submitted with the application for the building permit.
l. The Board may authorize the construction of an attached or detached accessory structure in the required side yard of a residential key lot provided that the following can be demonstrated:
1. The encroachment is not more than 50 percent of the required side yard set back
2. The accessory structure is architecturally compatible with the main structure.
3. The accessory structure is not a carport.
c. VARIANCES:
i. The Board may grant a variance only of the front yard, side yard, rear yard, lot width, lot depth, lot coverage, minimum setback standards, or landscaping requirements where the literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would result in the unnecessary hardship, and where such variance is necessary to permit the use or development of a specific parcel of land which differs from other parcels of land in the same district by being of such restricted area, shape, or slope that it cannot be developed in a manner consistent with the development permitted upon other parcels of land in the same district.
The Board may grant a variance in the height of any structure within an approach zone, airport area, turning zone, or transition zone of the Addison Airport, as such areas are depicted on the Revised Carrollton Airport Zoning Map, dated April, 1979.
A variance may be granted to an applicant when the Board finds:
a) That there are special circumstances or conditions applying to the land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or building and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the same zoning district or neighborhood, and that said circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building; and
b) That the granting of such variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such zone or neighborhood in which the property is located; and
c) That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance is granted by the Board is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose; and
d) That the literal enforcement and strict application of the provisions of this ordinance will result in an unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the general provisions and intent of this ordinance and that, in granting such variance, the spirit of the ordinance will be preserved and substantial justice done; and
ART. XXXII BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
CARROLLTON COMPREHENSIVE ZONING ORDINANCE 32 - 9
Updated February 1, 2020
e) In addition to considering the character and use of adjoining buildings and those in the vicinity, the Board, in determining its findings, shall take into account the number of persons residing or working in such buildings or upon such land and traffic conditions in the vicinity.
ii. The Board may, after public notice and hearing and subject to the conditions and safeguards herein contained, vary or adapt the strict application of any of the terms of this ordinance under the power and authority herein granted.
iii. In granting any variance under the provisions of this Article, the Board may designate such conditions in connection therewith which will, in its opinion, secure substantially the purpose and intent of this ordinance.
iv. A variation from the standards established by this ordinance shall not be granted to relieve a self-created or personal hardship, nor for financial reason only, nor shall such modification be granted to permit any person a privilege in developing a parcel of land not permitted by this ordinance to other parcels of land in the district.

General Information

Effective January 2018, Application submissions are accepted by the Planning Department on or before the last Tuesday of each month. The applicant should consult with the Planning Department before filing an application to discuss the feasibility of the request and any additional requirements.

Platting is the process by which land is subdivided. The plat review process is intended to determine if the subdivision layout is in compliance with the city's development standards by providing adequate street and alley rights-of-way, utility easements and other necessary items to serve the proposed development. To ensure that the plat meets all of the requirements of the Subdivision Ordinance, consult with the Planning Department prior to preparing the submission.

A Final Plat or an Administrative Plat is required for the creation of a legal lot of record. An Administrative Plat allows approval of a minor plat through administrative action in certain circumstances without review and approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission, and as authorized under Section 212.0065 of the Texas Local Government Code.

Replats apply to previously platted property and are required to alter or create new lot lines, remove platted building lines and to remove fire lanes or easements from a recorded plat. State law requires that a public hearing be held for the consideration of a replat of single-family or duplex zoned property, and in addition requires notification of all property owners in the original subdivision within 200 feet of the replat.

An Amending Plat is required to correct minor errors, as defined by state law, on a previously approved and filed plat.

A plat may be vacated (that is, dissolved) at any time before any lot is sold. However, if any of the lots within the subdivision have been sold, all owners of lots within such subdivision must sign the vacation plat if the entire plat or any part of the plat is to be vacated.

The plat approval process requires at least 30 days from the date of the application deadline, and requires approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission, with the exception of Administrative Plats, which are approved at staff level.

Application and Approval Process

PRELIMINARY PLATS

Application

The applicant must submit a completed application form, application fee, correct number of bluelines, and PMTs or Stats of the property being platted to the Planning Department. Mylar or acetate and photocopy reductions will not be accepted. Prior to the processing of an application, any delinquent property taxes must be paid.
Staff Review

The proposed plat is distributed to City departments for review to determine the plat's compliance with applicable City standards. After that review, City staff will make recommendations to the Planning & Zoning Commission based upon the plats compliance with applicable City standards.
Planning &
Zoning Commission

The Planning & Zoning Commission meets on the 1st Thursday and if needed the 3rd Thursday of each month. The Commission may approve the preliminary plat (with or without staff recommendations) or deny the plat if it fails to comply with City standards. If the preliminary plat is approved, a blueline copy of the plat (complying with any modifications required by the Planning & Zoning Commission), must be submitted to the Planning Department. Approval of a preliminary plat is valid for one (1) year or the approved preliminary plat becomes invalid and must be re-approved. 
Submitting a Final Plat

After the Planning & Zoning Commission approves the preliminary plat and the applicant submits the approved plat to the Planning Department, the applicant may submit an application for approval of a final plat.
FINAL PLATS

Application

Planning & Zoning Commission

The Commission may either approve the plat, with or without the staff recommendations, or deny the plat if it fails to comply with City standards. If the plat is approved, one blueline copy (complying with any modifications required by the Commission) must be submitted for review to the Planning Department. If the plat complies with the requirements of the Commissions approval, the applicant may submit the required number of signed copies with the appropriate county clerk (or clerks) for filing, returning two copies to the Planning department. 
Filing

The Planning Department will review the signed copies and forward them for signatures by the Chairman of the Planning & Zoning Commission, the Director of Planning and the City Secretary. City staff will return the plat to the applicant to be recorded with the appropriate county clerk (or clerks). The plat must be recorded within six (6) months of the Commissions approval, or the approved plat becomes invalid and must be re-approved before it can be recorded. Two copies of the recorded plat are required to be returned to the Planning Department.
ADMINISTRATIVE PLATS

Application

The applicant must submit a completed application form, application fee, correct number of bluelines, and PMTs or Stats of the property being platted to the Planning Department. Mylar or acetate and photocopy reductions will not be accepted. Prior to the processing of an application, any delinquent property taxes must be paid.
Staff Review

The proposed administrative plat is distributed to City departments for review to determine the plats compliance with applicable City standards. After that review, City staff will provide the applicant with a list of modifications, if any, necessary for the plat to comply with City standards.
