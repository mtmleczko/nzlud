PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Richardson, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1966 Code, as supplemented through September 23, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a modern system which uses a prefix system as follows: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Ronald K. McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. H. Louis Nichols, City Attorney, and Ms. Ina E. Garber, City Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Chapter 2 - ADMINISTRATION 
ARTICLE I. - CODE OF ETHICS 

Sec. 2-1. - Purpose. 
    It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible only to the people of the city; that no officer shall permit any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engagement in any business, transaction or professional activity to conflict with the proper discharge of such person's duties in the public interest; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the city council at all times shall be maintained as a nonpartisan body. To implement such a policy, the city council deems it advisable to enact a code of ethics for officials, as defined in this article, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, to serve not only as a guide for official conduct of the city's public servants, but also as a basis for discipline for those who refuse to abide by its terms, the overriding interest being that such officers of the city shall at all times strive to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

(d)  This code of ethics applies to members of all city boards, committees or commissions as defined in this article, except when such member is an independent contractor of the city, or a city employee, including an individual employed on a full-time, part-time or internship basis.

When the city attorney receives a vague complaint or one lacking in detail, the city attorney shall contact the complainant to request a written clarification. If the complainant fails to provide the city attorney with written clarification, or if after written clarification is provided, it is the opinion of the city attorney that the complaint is insufficient in detail and/or fails to allege a prima facie violation of the code of ethics, a written report to that effect shall be submitted to the city council. If the city attorney determines that a criminal violation may exist, the city attorney shall refer the matter to the appropriate law enforcement agency. 
(c)  If it is determined by the city attorney that the facts as alleged could constitute a violation of this code of ethics, then the city attorney shall, within 15 business days after receipt of the complaint, notify the mayor and city council members of the existence and nature of the complaint. The city council shall cause a meeting to convene, whether regular or special, within 15 business days after being so notified by the city attorney to further consider said complaint in executive session with mayor or any three members of the city council (excluding the mayor) causing such a meeting to be convened. In any event, the city attorney shall immediately proceed to fully investigate the alleged improprieties. For purposes of this investigation, the city attorney shall have all of the powers of investigation as are given to the city council by reason of the City Charter and shall report back to the city council as soon as possible but in no event more than 15 business days from the date of notification of the city council unless an extension is granted by the city council. Said report shall be comprehensive and explain in detail all facts, findings and conclusions in support of the city attorney's opinion as to whether a violation of this code of ethics occurred. 
(d)  The city council shall consider the complaint and the city attorney's report at an executive session of the city council. The affected officer may request that the complaint be considered in a public meeting. At such meeting, the city attorney shall present a written report to the city council describing in detail the nature of the complaint and the city attorney's findings and conclusions as to a possible violation of this code of ethics. The affected officer shall have the right to a full and complete hearing before the city council with the opportunity to call and cross-examine witnesses and present evidence in such person's behalf. The non-implicated city council members in attendance shall conduct a hearing and review the complaint.

(g)  A complaint or allegation of a violation of this article may only be made against an officer while such person holds such position or office. A complaint made against an officer pursuant to this section shall be processed and resolved even if such person resigns from, or ceases to hold such position or office, prior to resolution of the complaint.

(1)  Issue a statement finding the complaint is totally without merit, brought for the purpose of harassment, or brought in bad faith. 
(2)  Issue a letter of notification when the violation is unintentional. A letter of notification shall advise the officer of any steps to be taken to avoid future violations. 
(3)  Issue a letter of admonition when the violation is minor or may have been unintentional but calls for a more substantial response than a letter of notification. 
(4)  Issue a reprimand when a violation has been committed knowingly or intentionally. 
(5)  Remove from office an officer, other than a city council member, for a serious or repeated violation of this code of ethics. Removal shall be, to the extent by and allowed, in compliance with the Charter and state law. 
(6)  Pass a resolution of censure or a recommendation of recall when the city council finds that a serious or-repeated violation of this code of ethics has been committed intentionally by a member of the city council.

From Greenville Avenue to Central Expressway between Tyler and Polk Streets, except for Southern Pacific Railroad property between Interurban and Texas Streets. 
(Code 1966,  5-32) 
Sec. 6-2. - Home improvement tax incentive program. 
(a)  Purpose. Pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 380, the city may, subject to available funding and the conditions of this program, provide economic development incentives equal to the increase in property taxes for a single-family residential structure following the construction of improvements to, or the remodeling of, such residence. 
(b)  Incentive. The city may provide an economic development incentive equal to 100 percent of the increase in property taxes for the tax year following the completion of an approved project as the result of the increase in the certified appraised value of the residence as determined by the appraisal district. Said incentive will be based on the increase in property taxes in the first tax year following completion of the improvements. That amount will be multiplied by ten and paid in a single lump-sum payment (see example below). The economic development incentive shall be provided through a contract between the city and the property owner to be prepared and approved by the city attorney. The economic development incentive may be assigned one time in connection with the sale or transfer of the ownership (including a life estate) of the residence to a subsequent owner. In the event the residence is sold or transferred following an assignment, the economic development incentive agreement shall automatically terminate. 
(c)  Eligibility requirements. All residential property zoned single-family is eligible for participation in the program. Projects for home improvements, modifications or remodeling of single-family residences are eligible for the property tax rebate incentive provided the certified construction costs of the project are a minimum of $20,000.00. The project must be completed within 24 months after approval by the city as an eligible project for participation in the program. The property owner will be required to consent to periodic inspections by the city as the project is constructed. The property owner will be required to provide such information as the city staff may reasonably require to verify the costs incurred by the property owner for the project. Property owners or persons who are delinquent in payment of property taxes or other fees owed to the city are ineligible to participate in the program. 
(d)  Application. A person desiring to participate in the program shall submit an application to the neighborhood services division on a form provided by the city. The application shall require the property owner to provide the details of the proposed home improvement project, the estimated project costs and such other information as the city may require. 
(e)  Review process. The application shall be reviewed by the neighborhood services division manager (or designee) who shall determine whether the proposed project qualifies for the program and the amount of the approved project costs. The neighborhood services division manager shall review a completed application within 15 business days after submission. If an application is incomplete or if additional information is required, the neighborhood services division manager shall notify the property owner accordingly. The property owner shall provide a complete application or the requested information, as the case may be, within the stated time period or the application will be deemed withdrawn. The neighborhood services division will notify the property owner in writing if the application is denied or approved, and if approved, the amount of the approved project costs, as well as provide the required incentive contract. The property owner will be required to execute and return the incentive contract within 15 business days after receipt from the city. 
(f)  Incentive payment. The total incentive will be paid to the property owner pursuant to the economic development agreement on April 1 of the first full calendar year after completion of an approved project. For example, assume that a project is completed in June, 2007. The payment of the economic development incentive would be paid on April 1, 2009. Further assume that the 2008 property taxes increased $300.00 above the 2007 property taxes as a result of the increase in the taxable value of the improvements. The total incentive would be $3,000.00 and would be paid on April 1, 2009. The amount of the incentive shall be determined by the neighborhood services division manager, whose decision shall be final in all respects.

Sec. 6-312. - Findings. 
    There exist in the city structures used for human habitation and nonresidential purposes that are substandard in structure and maintenance. Furthermore, inadequate provision for light and air, insufficient protection against fire, lack of proper heating, unsanitary conditions, and overcrowding constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the citizens of the city. The existence of such conditions will create slum and blighted areas requiring large scale clearance, if not remedied. Furthermore, in the absence of corrective measures, such areas will experience a deterioration of social values, a curtailment of investment and tax revenue and an impairment of economic values. The establishment and maintenance of minimum standards are essential to the prevention of blight and decay and the safeguarding of public health, safety, morals and welfare. 
(Code 1966,  5-125) 
Sec. 6-313. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the citizens of the city by establishing minimum standards applicable to residential structures. Minimum standards are established with respect to utilities, facilities, and other physical components essential to make structures safe, sanitary and fit for human use and habitation. Demolition of structures is provided for as a last resort when compliance with standards cannot reasonably be achieved. 
(b)  This article is found to be remedial and essential to the public interest, and it is intended that this article be liberally construed to effect its purpose. All structures within the city on the effective date of this article, or constructed thereafter, must comply with the provisions of this article.

(Code 1966,  5-129) 
Sec. 6-328. - Urban nuisance; repair, demolition, receivership, and civil penalties; notice. 
(a)  The chief building official shall give notice of a hearing to consider repair, demolition or receivership of a structure, or the assessment of a civil penalty against the owner, to the owner or owners, lessor, and occupant of the structure, and any mortgagee or lienholder of record of the real property concerned. A structure may be considered for repair, demolition, receivership or civil penalty if the structure is not maintained in compliance with one or more of the minimum standards of this article, and the structure is an urban nuisance. 
(b)  A public hearing to consider repair, demolition or receivership of a structure, or the assessment of a civil penalty against the owner, shall be before the commission after notice has been given to the person set forth in subsection (a) of this section. At the hearing the chief building official or his designated representative shall present evidence of the condition of a structure and an owner, lessor, occupant, mortgagee and lienholder, as well as any interested person, may present evidence on relevant issues. 
(c)  The commission, after hearing evidence from each interested person present, may: 
(1)  Find that the structure is not an urban nuisance and refer the matter to the chief building official for further appropriate actions; 
(2)  Grant a variance in order to avoid the imposition of an unreasonable hardship; 
(3)  In the case of a single-family dwelling occupied by the owner where the health, safety and welfare of other persons will not be affected, grant an exception to any provision of this article to avoid the imposition of an unreasonable hardship; or 
(4)  Find the structure is an urban nuisance and order: 
a.  Demolition of the structure; 
b.  Repair or correction of the structure within a specified period of time; 
c.  Repair or correction of the structure within a specified period of time and demolition of the structure if the repair or correction is not timely effected; 
d.  Repair or correction of the structure by the owner, mortgagee or lienholder within a specified period of time and repair or correction by the city if not timely effected by the owner, mortgagee or lienholder; 
e.  Repair, correction or demolition of the structure within a specified period of time and the assessment of a civil penalty against the owner for each day or part of a day that the owner fails to repair, correct or demolish the structure; 
f.  An action be brought in district court in accordance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code  214.003, as amended for the employment of a receiver of the property; 
g.  Vacation of the structure as necessary; or 
h.  Closure of an open and vacant structure. 
(d)  Demolition of a structure may be accomplished by an owner, mortgagee or lienholder as compliance with this section or by the city. Repair of a structure may be accomplished by an owner, mortgagee or lienholder as compliance with this section, or by the city, but only to the extent necessary to bring their structure into compliance with minimum standards and only if the structure is a residential structure with not more than ten dwelling units. Vacation of a structure or relocation of the occupants of a structure may be accomplished by an owner, mortgagee or lienholder as compliance with this section or by the city. 
(e)  The expense of repair, vacation, removal, closure or demolition of a structure when performed under contract with this city or by city forces, and any civil penalty assessed against the owner, constitutes a nontransferable lien against the real property on which the structures stands or stood, unless it is a homestead protected by the state Constitution, and the lien runs with the land. The city's lien attaches when notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the property is located. Notice must contain the name and address of the owner, if reasonably determinable, a legal description of the real property, the amount of expenses incurred by the city, and the balance due. The city's lien for demolition, vacation, removal and closure expenses is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens and all previously recorded bona fide mortgage liens attached to the property, if each mortgagee and lienholder is given notice and an opportunity to repair or demolish the structure. The city's lien for repair expenses or civil penalties is inferior to any previously recorded bona fide mortgagee lien attached to real property if the mortgage lien was filed for record in the county clerk's office of the county in which the real property is located before the date the civil penalty is assessed or the repair is begun by the city, but is superior to all other previously recorded judgment liens. A lien acquired by the city under this subsection for repair expenses may not be foreclosed if the structure upon which the repairs were made is the residential homestead of a person 65 years of age or older and is occupied by that person. 
(f)  The city may use lawful means to collect, repair, vacation, removal, closure and demolition cost and civil penalties from an owner. Any civil penalty or other assessment imposed on this section accrues interest at the rate of ten percent a year from the date of the assessment until paid in full. In any judicial proceeding regarding enforcement of city rights under this article, the prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees from the nonprevailing party. 
(g)  The chief building official shall give notice of demolition, repair by the city, or the assessment of the civil penalty, if the chief building official determines that the owner has not complied with an order to repair. 
(h)  The chief building official shall give notice of an order of the commission and notice of demolition, repair by the city, or the assessment of a civil penalty, at the time of issue, to each person designated in subsection (a) of this section and shall file each order of the commission in the deed records of the county where the property is located. If an order to demolish or repair is timely effected, the building official or his designated representative shall, upon request and payment of the cost by the owner, file a notice of compliance in the deed records of the county where the property is located. 
(i)  When an order of the commission has been filed in the county deed records, the execution of the order is not affected by a sale or other transfer of the premises. A person acquiring interest in property after an order has been so filed is subject to the requirements of the order. Provisions of this subsection shall be included as part of each order. 
(j)  The chief building official or his designated representative shall serve notice required by this section by certified United States mail, return receipt requested, sent to the last known address of the person being notified. If the certified mail is returned undelivered, the building official or his designated representative may serve the notice personally if the person to be notified can be found in Collin County or Dallas County, Texas. If the notice sent to an owner is returned undelivered, and after diligent search, the chief building official or his designated representative is unable to discover a correct address for the owner or is unable to serve the owner personally, then the chief building official or his designated representative shall give notice by publication of the order once in the official newspaper of the city at least five days before the hearing. 
(Code 1966,  5-136) 
Sec. 6-329. - Vacation of structure. 
(a)  When the chief building official or his designated representative has given notice of a hearing to consider vacation of a structure, the building official or his designated representative shall place a sign on the structure or dwelling unit. The sign shall serve as a warning of the unsafe, unsanitary, and dangerous condition of the structure. A person commits an offense if he does any of the following: 
(1)  Without authority from the chief building official moves or destroys a sign placed by the chief building official. 
(2)  Occupies a vacant structure or dwelling unit on which the chief building official has placed such sign. 
(3)  As the owner of a structure or dwelling unit, authorizes a person to occupy a vacant structure or dwelling unit on which the chief building official has placed such sign.

(c)  The owner shall provide alternative housing to all tenants as required in division 3, subdivision II, of this article.

(2)  Depositing the notice in the United States mail addressed to the owner at the owner's post office address; 
(3)  Publishing the notice at least twice within a ten-day period in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the structure is located, if personal service cannot be obtained and the owner's post office address is unknown; or 
(4)  Posted the notice on or near the front door of the structure, if personal service cannot be obtained and the owner's post office address is unknown. 
(d)  The notice issued under subsection (c) must contain: 
(1)  An identification, which is not required to be a legal description, of the structure and the property on which it is located; 
(2)  A description of the violation of the minimum standards that is present at the structure; 
(3)  A statement that the chief building official will secure or has secured, as the case may be, the structure; and 
(4)  An explanation of the owner's entitlement to request a hearing about any matter relating to the chief building official's securing of the structure. 
(e)  A public hearing shall be held before the board if, within 30 days after the date the chief building official secures the structure, the owner files with the chief building official a written request for the hearing. The hearing must be held within 20 days after the date the request is filed. At the hearing, the chief building official shall present evidence of the need to secure a structure and the owner may testify or present witnesses or written information about any matter relating to the chief building official's securing of the structure. 
(f)  The board shall uphold the chief building official's action in securing a structure if it finds the structure or a portion of the structure to be open and potentially dangerous to the health, safety, or welfare of the public. A structure is open if a door, window, or other opening is not securely closed to prevent unauthorized entry, and the structure is left unattended. 
(g)  The expense of securing a structure, when performed under city contract or by city forces, constitutes a lien against the real property on which the structure is located, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution. The city's lien attaches when notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the property is located. The notice must contain the name and address of the owner, if reasonably determinable, a legal description of the real property, the amount of expenses incurred by the city, and the balance due. If each mortgagee and lienholder of the property is given notice required to be given the owner under this section and an opportunity to repair or demolish the structure, the city's lien is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens and all previously recorded bona fide mortgage liens attached to the property. The city may use lawful means to collect closure costs from an owner. 
(h)  The chief building official may place a red placard on an open and vacant structure or portion of a structure warning of its dangerous condition. 
(1)  No person without authority from the director shall remove a red placard placed by the director. 
(2)  No person shall occupy an open and vacant structure on which a red placard has been placed. A person who begins occupying a structure or portion of a structure after the director places a red placard on the structure warning of its dangerous condition is also subject to the restrictions of section 6-329. 
(i)  An unoccupied structure that is closed pursuant to an order of the chief building official, the board, or the fire marshal, or that is closed by the owner of the structure without an official order, must be secured in compliance with this chapter. 
(j)  A structure intended for residential use or occupancy that, pursuant to an order of the chief building official, the board, or the fire marshal, is closed by the owner through sealing the doors or windows with boards, or equivalent materials, shall be referred by the chief building official to the board for appropriate action under this chapter if the structure: 
(1)  Remains boarded up for 180 days or more without being occupied by the owner or a lawful tenant; and 
(2)  Has at least one visible violation of this chapter.

    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended, and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see the definition of "flood"). 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis, and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

    Special flood hazard area - see Area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements, see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations). 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or other evidence of compliance required in sections 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datm (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

Sec. 9-4. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 1966,  151/2-17) 
Sec. 9-5. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public harm and private losses in special flood hazard areas with provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities. 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to flood, including public facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, their protective barriers and stream channels. 
(4)  Prevent the construction of barriers which will divert floodwaters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards. 
(5)  Control development which would cause greater erosion or potential flood damage, such as grading, dredging and excavation. 
(Code 1966,  151/2-18) 
Sec. 9-6. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and property exposed to the hazards of flood. 
(2)  To ensure that potential property owners are notified if property is in a special flood hazard area. 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions. 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges, located in special flood hazard areas. 
(6)  To minimize expenditure of future public money for costly flood control projects. 
(7)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas. 
(Code 1966,  151/2-19)

(Code 1966,  151/2-38) 
Sec. 9-42. - Duties and responsibilities of the city engineer. 
    The duties and responsibilities of the city engineer under this chapter shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Maintain and hold open for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Review, approve or deny all applications for development permits required by section 9-43. 
(3)  Review permits for proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies (including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334) from which prior approval is required. 
(4)  Review permit applications to determine whether a proposed building site will be reasonably safe from flooding.

(Code 1966,  151/2-39; Ord. No. 2866-A,  2, 12-23-91; Ord. No. 4221 ,  3, 5-22-17) 
Editor's note- 
SECTION 1. That in order to protect the public health and safety for both present and future developments within the watershed, the following eight policies are hereby endorsed: 
1. 
BFE: 100-year floodplain - Fully developed watershed land use. The base flood elevation (BFE) and floodplain used for design and planning should be evaluated upon total stormwater discharge quantities that will, through future urbanization, be generated from a fully developed watershed. 
2. 
Allow no rise in base flood elevation. Reclamation of the floodplain should be permitted only if it can be demonstrated that there will be no rise in the base flood elevation. 
3. 
Velocity controls. Velocity controls should be established which specify maximum allowable flow rates for specific channel, bed and bank treatments. 
4. 
No alteration or channelization of Rowlett Creek and its major tributaries (Spring Creek, Prairie Creek and Beck Branch) except where required for safety and public welfare. The drainageway, which includes the floodway, of the creek and its major tributaries should be left in a natural state to control erosive velocities, prevent excessive downstream discharges and preserve the natural effect of the stream. 
5. 
Seek public ownership of remaining floodplain. Any floodplain remaining after final reclamation should be deeded or dedicated to the city to prevent further encroachment and assure proper drainage maintenance. 
6. 
Buffer zones. Each city should require parallel streets, greenbelts, etc., along the stream corridor to assure access and to create buffer zones between the floodplain and development. 
7. 
Linear park. Cooperation in development of a contiguous linear park along the Rowlett Creek stream corridor should be actively pursued. 
8. 
Pursue discussion of specific development standards. Further evaluation and discussion of specific development standards such as detention policies and minimum floor slab elevations should be jointly pursued to insure adequate water quality protection and flood water control. 
Sec. 9-43. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A floodplain development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Code 1966,  151/2-40) 
Sec. 9-44. - Permit procedures. 
    The following provisions shall apply to all permits granted pursuant to this chapter: 
(1)  Application for a development permit shall be presented to the city engineer on forms furnished by him and may include, but not be limited to, plans in triplicate, drawn to scale, showing the location, dimensions and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard. Additionally, the following information is required: 
a.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved structures. 
b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed. 
c.  FEMA elevation certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria of subsection 9-67(b). 
d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
(2)  Approval or denial of a development permit by the city engineer shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors: 
a.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
b.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
c.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 
d.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
e.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
f.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems. 
g.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters, and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
h.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable. 
i.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use. 
(Code 1966,  151/2-41) 
Sec. 9-45. - Variance procedures. 
    The following provisions shall apply to variances from permits granted pursuant to section 9-43: 
(1)  The city council shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  The city council shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the city engineer in the enforcement of administration of this chapter. 
(3)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(4)  The city engineer shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(6)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 9-44 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(7)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter. 
(8)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or area of special flood hazard if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(9)  The prerequisites for granting variances shall be as follows: 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(10)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the criteria outlined in subsections (1) through (9) of this section are met, and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 9-66. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(4)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(5)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
(6)  Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(7)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities, shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(Code 1966,  151/2-53) 
Sec. 9-67. - Residential and nonresidential construction and manufactured homes. 
(a)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or land surveyor shall submit a FEMA elevation certificate to the city engineer that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in subsection 9-44(1)a., is satisfied. 
(b)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated two feet above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be designed so that below the level that is two feet above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(c)  Manufactured homes. Manufactured homes shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No manufactured home shall be placed in a floodway. 
(2)  All manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(3)  All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with subsection (a) of this section. 
(4)  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is two feet above the base flood elevation, and shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. 
(d)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor, that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must be certified by a registered professional engineer and meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(1)  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
(2)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
(3)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(e)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 9-8, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increases in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which are greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 9-8 or subsection 9-42(8). 
(4)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

Surplus proceeds remaining from an auction shall be distributed in accordance with section 14-79. 
(e)  Except for the termination or limitation of claim for storage for failure to report an abandoned motor vehicle, nothing in this section may be construed to impair any lien of a garage keeper under the laws of this state.

(Ord. No. 4227 ,  3, 8-21-17) 
Sec. 20.5-13. - Construction obligations; permit required. 
(a)  Any person seeking to place facilities on, in or over the public rights-of-way shall first file an application for a construction permit with the city and shall abide by the terms and provisions of this article pertaining to use of the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A person is subject to reasonable police power regulation of the city to manage its public rights-of-way in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance, repair of facilities or other work in the public rights-of-way, pursuant to the city's rights as a custodian of public property, based upon the city's historic rights under state and federal laws. Such regulations include, but are not limited to the following: 
(1)  At the city's request, a person shall furnish the city accurate and complete information relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance, and repair of facilities performed by the person in the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A person shall be required to place certain facilities within the public rights-of-way underground absent a compelling demonstration by the person that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable, feasible, or equally applicable to other similar users of the public rights-of-way. 
(3)  A person shall perform excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, including the engineering division detailed standards for public right-of-way construction (detailed standards), as may be revised from time to time in accordance with the city's police powers, and the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations on other similar users of the public right-of-way. The city may waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the person. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property and all facilities placed underground shall be locatable with above ground instruments. A person shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(4)  A person lawfully authorized to place facilities in the public rights-of-way must obtain a permit, as reasonably required by applicable city codes, prior to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation, or maintenance of the person's facilities. A construction permit is not required for routine maintenance so long as the work does not require excavation of the public rights-of-way or does not block traffic lanes or sidewalks; however, any construction standards in the detailed standards shall remain applicable regardless of whether or not a permit is required. A permit is not required when so provided by state law, but in such cases the provisions regarding required notice apply. An approved lane, sidewalk or trail closure plan is required if a traffic lane, sidewalk or trail will be closed due to right-of-way work, regardless of whether or not a permit is required. Once a permit is issued, person shall give to the city a minimum of 48 hours' notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of the above-listed activities on its facilities in, on, or under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the person to request and obtain a permit from the city prior to performing any of the above-listed activities in, on, or over any public right-of-way, except in an emergency as provided for in subsection (11) below, will subject the person to a stop-work order from the city and enforcement action pursuant to this chapter. If the person fails to act upon any permit within 30 calendar days of issuance, the permit shall become invalid, and the person will be required to obtain another permit, unless extended for good cause by the city. 
(5)  When a person completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation or other work, the person shall promptly restore the public rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. A person shall replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base, irrigation system, and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance, or repair of the person's facilities within ten calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the time of the work, unless extended by the city for good cause. 
(6)  Upon failure of a person to perform any such repair or replacement work, and five days after written notice has been given by the city to the person, and in the event repairs have not been initiated during such five-day period, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been disturbed by the person, its contractors, or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the person will reimburse the city in accordance with the detailed standards within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(7)  Should the city reasonably determine, within two years from the date of the completion of the repair work, that the surface, base, irrigation system, or landscape treatment requires additional restoration work to meet standards at the time of the excavation of the city, a person shall perform such additional restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies as provided herein. 
(8)  Notwithstanding the foregoing in subsection (7) above, if the city determines that the failure of a person to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts, after emergency notice has been provided, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances and the person failed to respond within the reasonable time specified by the city. A person shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(9)  A person shall furnish the city with the application for the construction permits, construction plans and maps showing the location and proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction at least ten business days unless otherwise extended by the city before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way by the city. A person may not begin construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing. 
(10)  If the city manager declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, a person shall remove or abate the person's facilities by the deadline provided in the city manager's request. The person and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of service. If the person, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the person, without paying compensation to the person and without the city incurring liability for damages. 
(11)  Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent harm to property or person (emergency conditions), a person may not excavate the pavement of a street or public rights-of-way without first complying with city requirements. The city manager shall be notified as promptly as possible regarding work performed under such emergency conditions, and the person shall comply with the requirements of city standards for the restoration of the public rights-of-way. 
(12)  On an annual basis, no later than January 31 of each year, the user shall provide updates to the department or personnel designated by the city manager showing any new facilities from the previous year in the format required by the city.

The city manager may waive or reduce the bonding requirements in a nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral manner, taking into consideration both that the person has furnished the city with reasonable documentation to evidence adequate financial resources substantially greater than the bonding requirements, and has demonstrated in prior right-of-way construction activity, prompt resolution of any claims and substantial compliance with all required applicable building codes and ordinances. 
(14)  In determining whether any requirement under this section is unreasonable or unfeasible, the city manager shall consider, among other things, whether the requirement would subject the person or persons to an unreasonable increase in risk or service interruption, or to an unreasonable increase in liability for accidents, or to an unreasonable delay in construction or in availability of its services, or to any other unreasonable technical or economic burden or result in discriminatory treatment by a person. 
(15)  For installation of any proposed pole applicant shall provide engineered drawings, geotechnical drawings, geotechnical study or studies, and evidence of ADA and PROWAG compliance, sectional detail showing depth of anchor, scaled dimensional drawings of the proposed pole, as well as any other proposed equipment associated with the proposed installation, and shall indicate spacing from existing curb, driveways, sidewalk, light poles, and any other poles or appurtenances.

For projects expected by the city to take longer than 120 days to remove, change or relocate, the city will confer with the user before determining the alterations to be required and the timing thereof. The city shall give notice whenever the city has determined that removal, relocation, change, or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance, or installation of a city governmental public improvement in the public rights-of-way. This section shall not be construed to prevent a right-of-way user's recovery of the cost of relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for relocation or removal, nor shall it be required if improvements are solely for beautification purposes without prior joint deliberation and agreement with the person. 
(e)  If the user fails to relocate facilities in the time allowed by the city in this section, the user may be subject to liability to the city for such delay and as set forth in this chapter, now or hereafter enacted. Additionally, the user may be denied any new permits until the relocation is complete. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything in subsection (d) above, the city manager and a person may agree in writing to different time frames than those provided above if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change. 
(g)  Any right-of-way user trimming trees shall be required to remove trimmings within 24 hours; provided, however, if any trimmings affect right-of-way use, said trimmings must be removed immediately. If said trimmings are not removed, the city may remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of a bill from the city, the person shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred within 30 calendar days. Users shall not be responsible for tree trimming or removal, except as to the work required to construct, maintain, or restore utility service.

(3)  Each policy must include a cancellation provision in which the insurance company is required to notify the city in writing not fewer than 30 days before canceling, failing to renew, or reducing policy limits. 
(4)  For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the State of Texas or letters written by the person in those instances where the state does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required herein. However, for the city to accept such letters, the person must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the city, based on financial information requested by and furnished to the city. 
(b)  A person shall furnish, at no cost to the city, copies of certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required by this section to the city, unless the city requires another form of legally binding proof of insurance. If the city requests a deletion, revision or modification, a person shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to accomplish the change.

(e)  An insurer has no right of recovery against the city. The required insurance policies shall protect the person and the city. The insurance shall be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies. 
(f)  The policy clause "other insurance" shall not apply to the city if the city is an insured under the policy. 
(g)  Person shall pay premiums and assessments. A company which issues an insurance policy has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a person must provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the city in connection with damage covered by the policy.

    [The following words, terms or phrases, as used in this article, shall have their given meanings:] 
    Highway railgrade or crossing means any street or highway crossing over a line of railroad at grade. 
    Locomotive horn means a train-borne audio warning device including a whistle or siren meeting standards specified by the United States Secretary of Transportation. 
    Supplementary safety measure means a safety system or procedure approved by the city for safety at a highway railgrade or crossing that is determined by the Federal Railroad Administration and/or the United States Secretary of Transportation to be an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties which fully compensates for the absence of the warning provided by the locomotive horn. A traffic control arrangement that prevents careless movement over the crossing (e.g., as where adequate median barriers prevent movement around crossing gates extending over the full width of the lanes in the particular direction of travel), and that conforms to the standards prescribed by the United States Secretary of Transportation under the Swift Rail Development Act of 1994, Public Law 103-440 as amended, shall be deemed to constitute a supplementary safety measure. The following do not, individually or in combination, constitute supplementary safety measures within the meaning of this definition: standard traffic control devices or arrangements such as reflectorized crossbucks, stop signs, flashing lights, flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel with the line of railroad, or traffic signals. 
(Ord. No. 3075-A,  1, 6-3-96) 
Sec. 22-181. - Whistle ban designation. 
(a)  Unless preempted by federal or state law the city council may designate selected highway railgrades or crossings within the city at which the engineer or person in charge of a railroad locomotive shall not ring, blow or sound the bell, whistle, horn or siren of the railroad locomotive within 3,000 feet of residential areas at which approved supplementary safety measures are installed. 
(b)  Any person or property owner requesting the approval and installation of supplemental safety measures at a railway grade or crossing shall submit plans and specifications to the city traffic engineer for supplemental safety measures which meet or exceed a safety system or procedure determined by the Federal Railroad Administration and/or the United States Secretary of Transportation to be an effective substitute for the railroad locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties and which fully compensate for the absence of the warning provided by the locomotive horn. Such person or property owner shall obtain approval of and contract with the railroad and/or the operating companies which own and/or control the railway grade crossing for the construction and maintenance of such supplemental safety measures and shall provide copies of such executed contracts and agreements to the city traffic engineer. The person or property owner requesting the approval and installation of the supplemental safety measure shall pay or cause to be paid all cost of construction, installation and maintenance of the supplemental safety measure, unless otherwise agreed by the city. 
(c)  The city traffic engineer shall review all plans and contracts submitted in connection with the approval of a supplemental safety measure and provide recommendations to the city council. If the city council finds that the proposed supplemental safety measure to be an effective substitute for the railroad locomotive horn and that all approvals, licenses, construction and maintenance agreements have been executed and the city attorney finds that such supplemental safety measure will not present additional liability exposure or risk to the city, the city council may approve the installation of the supplemental safety measure. After installation of the supplemental safety measure, testing and acceptance of the construction and equipment by the city and the affected railroad and/or operating company, the city council shall by resolution designate such railway grade or crossing at which a ban of the sounding of a railroad locomotive whistle, horn, bell or siren shall be in effect in accordance with this article.

Definitions and rules of construction generally,  1-2. 
Sec. 23-27. - Purpose of article. 
    The intent and purpose of this article is to provide an equitable charge for water and sanitary sewer connections as a proportionate distribution of the cost of water and sanitary sewer main extensions to serve property in the city on a front foot basis. 
(Code 1966,  23-53) 
Sec. 23-28. - Authority to make extensions. 
    The department of public services may extend water and sanitary sewer mains in the streets and alleys, or easements, within the city in order to permit connections by persons desiring and seeking water service and sanitary sewer service. 
(Code 1966,  23-54) 
Sec. 23-29. - Pro rata and other charges established. 
(a)  A charge, which shall be known as the pro rata, shall be made against each lot or tract of land, and the owner thereof, whose water or sewer lines shall be connected with any water mains or sewer mains in the city. Such charge shall be at the following rates, which rates are a portion of the total cost of such water and sewer mains: 
(1)  Seven dollars per front foot of the lot or tract of land to which water connections may be made. 
(2)  Seven dollars per front foot of the lot or tract of land to which sanitary sewer connections may be made. 
(b)  The above front foot rates shall apply to property fronting on a street in areas platted into the usual rectangular lots or tracts of land, with a depth not to exceed 150 feet. Where lots or tracts have a greater depth than 150 feet from the front street line, and are occupied, or are to be occupied exclusively as dwelling places, then the additional depth shall not be assessed. If the property is later subdivided, requiring an extension of mains to serve the same, then the terms of this article shall govern. On lots or tracts of land which extend through from one street to another, with frontage on both streets, and where the distance between the street lines is 260 feet or more, then the pro rata charges herein provided for shall be paid on both frontages when a connection is secured to the lot or tract. Where lots or tracts of land are irregular in size or shape, then pro rata charges shall be based upon the equivalent rectangular lots or tracts using one front foot for each 150 square feet of area, or the pro rata charges provided in this section on average frontage of such tracts, whichever is smaller. 
(c)  Where lots or tracts are intended to be used for business, commercial or industrial purposes, or have a depth greater than 150 feet from the front street line, then the pro rata herein provided shall be paid on the frontage on all streets which the property may abut. Should such property be resubdivided whereby water or sewer main extensions are required to serve the same, the terms of this article shall apply and additional pro rata charges shall be made based on such additional street frontage. 
(d)  In addition to the pro rata charge on water and sewer mains, the property owner must pay the tap charges as established by the city. 
(Code 1966,  23-55) 
Sec. 23-30. - General method of procedure. 
(a)  Upon request of the owner, or his agent, of a given lot or tract of land, for the purpose of this section known as applicant, accompanied by the payment of the charges due under this article, the city shall extend, lay or construct all necessary sanitary sewer and water mains, including valves and hydrants, a distance of 100 feet, plus the distance across the frontage necessary to provide the service for which application has been made. The applicant to be served shall be required to pay the charges provided for by this article. The owners of all intervening property served by the given main extensions shall be required to pay the charges provided for by this article at such time as their property is connected to the mains thus laid. Where an applicant for service secured an extension and service under this particular option for main extension, he shall pay the pro rata charges on all property owned by him and which is served by the requested extension. In applying the 100-foot rule, the required extension of the main shall be figured in such a manner as to leave out of the calculation that portion of any main adjacent to property already having other than a temporary water service and for which the pro rata charge thereon has been paid or credited under the terms of this article. 
(b)  An exception to the above 100-foot rule shall be made where two or more individual applicants desire water and/or sewer service and the nearest applicant is more than 100 feet from existing lines, the city will extend their mains upon payment of the charge due under this article provided there is one customer for every 100 feet of such extension, excluding street intersections and that portion of the extension adjacent to property already having other than temporary water and/or sewer service. 
(c)  In case property or a tract of land is so situated or shaped that the front foot rule creates an inequitable basis as between it and other tracts of land in the city then, in that case the city engineer shall determine the proper charge in accord with the intent and purposes of this article. 
(Code 1966,  23-56) 
Sec. 23-31. - Alternate method of procedure. 
(a)  At the option of the city, the following method for extending water and sewer mains may be used where the applicant's property is more than 100 feet from an existing water or sewer main. This method shall be available only for use by an individual owner or person to secure water and sewer service for the individual's residence or place of business. Where eligible for this option, the owner may advance and pay into the city the entire pro rata cost as set forth in this article, to wit: $7.00 per front foot for water extensions, and $7.00 per front foot for sewer extensions on all property served by the desired main extension, and the city, when such money has been actually deposited with the city, will construct the desired water or sewer main along the street, alley or easement. When any property for which such person has advanced the pro rata cost is connected to the main extension, then, in that event, the pro rata cost so advanced on that particular property shall be refunded by the city to the person making the original deposit. 
(b)  Where an extension is requested by an industry or commercial concern using large quantities of water and cannot meet the requirements of one customer per 100 feet of extension, such extension may be made at the discretion of the city council provided 40 percent of the estimated annual revenue from such customer will support interest and principal payments on a ten-year loan covering the cost of such extension, such loan bearing interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum. 
(Code 1966,  23-57) 
Sec. 23-32. - Extensions to be made by city or by contract. 
    All water and sanitary sewer main extensions shall be laid, constructed and installed by the city directly, or by contract made by the city. 
(Code 1966,  23-58) 
Sec. 23-33. - Extensions for subdivisions-Construction by city. 
(a)  Where extensions of water and sewer mains are required to serve property which has been subdivided or platted for development and resale, the city will construct such main upon deposit of the total cost of such extensions, including the cost of approach mains fronting property not owned by the developer, but necessary to connect the area for which application is made with the city water and sewer system. 
(b)  The developer will bear the total cost for construction of offsite or approaching mains required to interconnect property to be developed with existing mains, the sizes to be determined by the city, and with the only refunds to be the pro rata as collected by the department of public services. 
(c)  Any refund to the developer shall not exceed the cost of the pro rata charges if this means has been used to calculate the cost of water and sewer mains. 
(d)  The developer will bear the total cost of on-site mains, with sizes to be determined by the city, except that the city will refund the increment of cost on water and sewer mains over eight inches in diameter proportionately as the frontage served is connected. The increment of cost borne by the city shall be determined on the basis of the difference between the price bid for eight-inch water and sewer mains and the larger size required; provided that if the bid price for mains larger than eight inches are not considered reasonable by the city, the city will not be obligated to proceed under the terms of this article. 
(e)  There shall be a maximum of ten years as the period of eligibility wherein the original depositor may request a refund of pro rata payments under this section. The period of eligibility shall begin as of the date of final inspection and acceptance of the extensions by the city. 
(Code 1966,  23-59) 
Sec. 23-34. - Same-Construction by contract. 
(a)  At the option of the city, as an alternative plan, the developer may be permitted to pay for the total cost of installation of water and sewer extensions as provided for in this section in lieu of paying the pro rata charge provided for in this article. Upon approval by the city, a developer of an addition or plat shall design and prepare construction plans of water and sanitary sewer facilities, or either of them, to serve the subdivision, including any access or offsite facilities that may be required. These plans shall conform in all details to the city's standards as to the design, grade, location, size and quality of materials and construction. 
(b)  Plans and profiles submitted by the developer's engineer shall be inked on standard 24-inch by 36-inch sheets of tracing linen. Plans and profiles shall be shown at scales of not less than one inch to 100 feet horizontal, and one inch to six feet vertical. Plans and profiles shall show clearly all surface improvements, all existing or proposed subsurface utility lines and obstructions, and street and alley grades as approved by the department of public services or city engineer. The engineer submitting the plans and profiles must be a registered professional civil engineer in the state and he must affix his seal and signature to the tracings of all plans and profiles. The completed tracings for water and sewer plans and profiles shall be submitted to the department of public services or city engineer for approval, accompanied by two copies of the plans and profiles of the storm sewers and street grades as approved by the city engineer and one copy of the plat of the addition that has been recorded in the records of the county and has been so stamped. Upon final approval, the tracings will be returned to the developer's engineer for the purpose of making such prints as he may require, after which the tracings shall be returned to become the permanent property of the city. 
(c)  When the project is ready for construction, line and grade stakes will be set by the developer's engineer; but these stakes will not be set until after the developer's engineer has properly staked on the ground with iron pins all points of curves, all points of tangency, all block corners, and all lot corners within the subdivision. All construction and installation of water and sewer mains shall be supervised by inspectors of the city. 
(d)  All construction contracts shall be let upon city standard specifications for materials and performance. 
(e)  Upon approval of the plans by the city, the developer may enter into a contract with any individual or may himself construct the system as so planned; provided, however, that the construction and installation of the water lines and sewer lines, or either of them, shall be supervised by inspectors of the city, to see that the installation is made in accordance with the plans and the city's standard specification, which, in every instance, shall be a part of the installation contract.

(a)  No connection for a sprinkler or fire service shall be permitted without a meter, or a detector check with a bypass meter, except an alarm or closed system, and only after application therefor has been made and granted by the department of public services and approved by the plumbing inspector of the city. In no instance shall any connection be made with any sprinkler or fire service without the written consent of the department of public services. Should it be found that any unauthorized connection has been made, or that any water has been used from a sprinkler or fire service for any other purpose than extinguishing a fire, or that a waste of water is permitted from such connection through leaks in the pipes or fixtures, the water service shall be shut off and not turned on until a meter of the kind and size prescribed by the director of public services department shall have been furnished and installed at the expense of the consumer. In this event, the consumer shall make application for the service and pay the regular prescribed rates for the particular size of meter, in accordance with the schedules set out in this article. Failure to comply shall be sufficient cause for discontinuance of the service by the department of public services. 
(b)  The furnishing, installation, maintenance and inspection of all meters and services, checks, bypasses, valves, piping, etc., necessary for the installation and operation of sprinkler systems and fire services shall be at the expense of the consumer.

The property service line from city tap shall not be enlarged beyond the city tap. Standard fire service is hereby established as an eight-inch main or a six-inch main supported by an eight-inch main at each end. Availability of fire service shall depend upon the water main sizes and normal operating pressure in the area where the applicant's property is located. In the event such fire service will create a demand which will result in inadequate pressure to other customers in the area for any sustained period, the applicant will be required to construct storage facilities on his property sufficient to meet the necessary fire demand; provided, however, that as an alternate, upon approval of the department of public services, the company may provide such funds as are required to reinforce the system serving the applicant's property by installation of larger size mains. Such funds will not be refundable and the mains, when constructed, will become the property of the city, free of liens and encumbrances; further provided, that when ground storage reservoirs or fire pumps are installed by a private corporation, such pumps shall discharge into the fire system of the individual or corporation and an approved check valve shall be installed in the owner's fire service between the point where the pump discharges into such service and the connection of such fire service to the city mains, so as to prevent backflow from the fire pump into the city distribution system. The water in such fire storage tank will be maintained in a potable condition and subject to periodic inspection by personnel of the department of public services and such tanks and water quality shall be maintained in a manner wholly satisfactory to the standards and requirements of the state department of health and the city. Such tanks shall not be of the pressure type and the delivery of city water to the tank shall be above the tank flow line. In no case shall the supply line to this tank be controlled by a quick acting valve which will cause water hammer in the distribution system. Water tanks shall be equipped with an overflow pipe at least eight inches below the city inlet supply. Such overflow shall be protected in such a manner as to prevent access of insects, birds or animal life into the reservoir. The pipe shall be at least two inches larger in diameter than the inlet supply line from the city distribution system. Such storage tank shall be provided with drain pipe and valve for easy drainage of the tank. However, upon no condition shall the drain pipe be connected to the city sanitary sewer system.

(a)  The city has entered into a continuing contract with the North Texas Municipal Water District which requires that the city pay annually to the district charges based upon a take-or-pay contract (hereinafter required payment), which is based upon the maximum historical water purchases by the city. The required payment disregards actual revenue from the sale of water to the city's customers. If water sales revenue, after expenses, does not equal the required payment, the city is placed in a negative cash flow position. 
(b)  As a solution, the city shall have the right to periodically calculate the cash flow from water sales based upon a historical and projection perspective and to assess an adjustment upon water customers sufficient to enable water sales net revenue to at least equal the required payment. 
(c)  The city has established the period from August 1, 1994, to July 31, 1995, for historical usage and October 1, 1995, to September 30, 1996, for projection of water usage to establish adjustment for the fiscal period ending September 30, 1995. The adjustment for this period shall be assessed beginning October 1, 1995, and shall continue monthly thereafter so long as there is a deficit. 
(d)  All subsequent years shall use as an historical base the period from August 1 of the prior year through July 31 of the current year. The projection period will remain October 1 through September 30 of the current year. Adjustments will begin on October 1 in subsequent years, and shall continue monthly thereafter, subject to approval by the city council, so long as there is a deficit. 
(e)  The city shall maintain separate records of adjustment revenues and costs under this section, and the adjustment shall always appear as a separate billing item.

It is provided further that the superintendent of the department of public services may require such consumer to pay a fee for removing and testing the meter. The fee will be based upon the direct and indirect cost associated with providing this service and the city council shall, by resolution, ratify the charges, subject charges to be on file with the city secretary. 
(c)  If any meter of one inch or smaller, upon testing, shall have been found to register over two percent more water than actually passed through it, based on a series of tests over the range of flow recommended by its manufacturer, another meter will be substituted therefor, and the fee charged in the application for such test will be credited to the person making the application, and the account adjusted, not exceeding three months back.

(a)  The definition of a cross connection, as based upon the U. S. Department of Health, Education and Public Welfare's Public Health Service Publication No. 525, is any physical connection or arrangement of pipes between two otherwise separate water supply systems, one of which contains potable water and the other water of unknown or questionable safety, whereby water may flow from one system to the other, the direction of flow depending on pressure differential between the two systems. 
(b)  No cross connection shall be permitted to be made between any system of piping supplied by water from the mains of the department of public services and any other source of supply, either public or private; or any secondary supplies known to be unsafe for drinking water, such as shallow wells, reused industrial supplies, raw surface water or swimming pools, including swimming pools of the recirculating type, at which no secondary supply is used. This last has reference to connections of city water lines to swimming pools below the flow level for the purpose of supplying make-up water, and to pressure filters for the purpose of supplying wash water. 
(c)  Where city water is used as an auxiliary supply to a roof or suction tank, which is also supplied by water from any other source, such tank shall not be of the pressure type but open. The delivery of city water shall be above the tank flow line and controlled by some type of automatic valve. 
(d)  It shall be unlawful, also, to maintain storage tanks supplied only with city water, unless the tanks are satisfactorily built, and covered so as to prevent the entrance of contamination. They shall also be subject to periodical inspection by the department of public services and maintained in a manner wholly satisfactory to the standards and requirements of the state department of health. Pumps taking suction from the city supply, serving such building storage, shall be installed or operated only upon permit from the water department, subject to their approval as to size, rate, capacity and valving arrangements. 
(e)  It is intended that no private supplies, including deep well systems, shall be interconnected with the waterworks system, except as hereinafter provided: 
(1)  Correction and maintenance, in a manner satisfactory to the state department of health and the department of public services, of all existing sanitary defects in and around the private supply system. 
(2)  Provisions to be made for complete bacteriological analyses by the department of public services of the supply involved, in accordance with the standard methods of water analysis of the American Public Health Association. This requirement means not less than four analyses each month of two standard samples, more often, if the analyses warrant. 
(3)  Provision by the owner of the private system involved to pay an equitable pro rata part of the cost of all inspections and testing herein required. The rates and method of paying for the same shall be determined by the department of public services, subject to the approval of the city manager. 
(f)  Should any system supplied by city water be operated in violation of any provision of this article, it shall be the duty of the department of public services to completely disconnect all service lines serving such system until this section is properly complied with. Any cost of such disconnection and the estimated cost of reconnection must be paid for by the consumer before service shall be restored.

Such plumber shall in no event disconnect a meter or any fitting in a meter box, nor shall he change the level or location of such meter or meter box. Before leaving the premises, it shall be his duty to see that the meter box cover is securely in place and locked. It shall be unlawful for any plumber to make any extension to any lines or pipes using water from city water mains or to add any pipes or to change any pipes or lines from one water line, apartment, house, premises or meter, without first securing a permit for such changes. This applies to any water connections within or without the city. 
(b)  In case any unauthorized connections are found to have been made, fixtures added, and no permit taken for same, water shall be disconnected from such premises until corrections have been made and all permit fees have been paid. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful for any such plumber to leave any trench, ditch or excavation on any public right-of-way, such as any sidewalk, street, alley, parkway or any other public way, left open for inspection, unless the same is properly barricaded and lighted, and when the work has been inspected and approved by the city, such plumber shall backfill and securely tamp any such trench, ditch or excavation so that the public right-of-way shall be safe for both pedestrian and vehicular travel. Failure to comply with this provision shall render such plumber primarily liable for any damage or injury to person or property resulting therefrom. 
(d)  Failure of any plumber who does work, whether under a permit or in violation of this Code without a permit, to promptly pay all charges and permit fees, when a bill is rendered therefor by the city shall authorize the city, acting by and through its director of public services, to withhold any further permits pending payment of such charges and fees.

In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
c.  A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The control authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
d.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. 
e.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority. 
f.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator. 
g.  The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline monitoring report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
h.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(6)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in section 23-210), and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
a.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by this section, the information required in subsections (6) and (7) shall pertain to the modified limits. 
b.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) after the user submits the report required by this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by subsections (6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the user to the control authority within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.

Sec. 23-217. - Industrial wastewater surcharge. 
(a)  [Surcharge for above normal strength wastewater.] A surcharge may be applied in addition to the monthly sewer service charge for the discharge of above normal strength wastewater to cover the additional costs of treating such wastewater. Such a charge is collected by the city. 
(b)  [Calculation.] The surcharge shall be calculated as follows: 
C = [B (Bu-250) + S (Su-250)]  P  V 
Where: 
C = Surcharge to the user in dollars. B = Unit cost factor for treating one unit of BOD (per 1,000 gallons). Bu = The tested BOD of the discharge. S = Unit cost factor for treating one unit of total suspended solids (per 1,000 gallons). Su = The tested total suspended solids of the discharge. P = A factor of 8.34 to convert mg/l to pounds/gallon. V = Monthly billing volume (discharge) in thousand gallons. 250 = Average domestic BOD and total suspended solids (250 mg/l).  
(c)  Classes established. The control authority may classify commercial and industrial establishments which routinely discharge BOD and suspended solids in concentrations exceeding 250 mg/L into the following class groups: 
Class 
Description 
(1)  Eating places: Includes restaurants, bars, lounges and other establishments which engage in preparation of food or beverage which is served directly to the consumer. 
(1a)  Bars and lounges: Includes bars and lounges whose primary business is selling and servicing of beer, wine and/or liquor. An establishment where there are no cooking and/or food preparation. Most disposal is solid waste and hauled to a landfill; no garbage disposals are used. 
(2)  Equipment service facilities: Includes establishments which perform washing, cleaning or servicing of automobiles, trucks, buses, machinery, or equipment and includes public facilities, facilities limited to specific companies, attended and coin-operated establishments. 
(3)  Food and kindred products processing: Includes commercial establishments which engage in the preparation, packing, processing or distribution of food, food products, grains or produce, other than those includes in class (1) and which discharge less than 200,000 gallons of wastewater per month. 
(d)  Assessment of surcharge class rate. The control authority may assess an industrial surcharge rate for each class group based on industrial waste strength determinations established by averaging grab or composite samples, or both, taken from a representative number of establishments in each group and may apply this rate to the water consumption or metered wastewater of the establishment. If the establishment is within a larger facility for which water usage is determined from a master meter, the control authority may determine an estimated volume for the establishment to which the surcharge is applied. The control authority may then have the appropriate industrial surcharge billed to each establishment classified into a class group. 
(e)  Exceptions to surcharge class rate. If an establishment contains operations from more than one of the class groups, and the control authority determines that the surcharge rate for a particular class group would not adequately compensate the city for its cost of treatment, the control authority may: 
(1)  Assess a surcharge rate based on a proportional average of the class group rates involved; or

Such a test area may be taken as the cross-sectional area of the inlet to a sample probe. Emissions from the test area may be measured at the place and by the procedure which results in the highest measurement of air contaminants. The emission from any test area of a type B emission point shall be deemed to be representative in every respect of the emissions from the whole area of such type B emission point.

ARTICLE XXII-G. - NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Sec. 1. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds and determines that the construction of new single-family structures and the renovation, remodel, repair and expansion of existing single-family structures that are incompatible with existing single-family structures within certain established neighborhoods may be detrimental to the character, stability, and livability of that neighborhood and the city as a whole. The Neighborhood Development Overlay District shall function as an overlay zoning district. The requirements of a Neighborhood Development Overlay District shall supersede the regulations of the underlying zoning district where the regulations of the underlying zoning district are in conflict with the provisions of the Neighborhood Development Overlay District or this article. All regulations of the underlying zoning district shall be in effect except as otherwise provided in the Neighborhood Development Overlay District regulations. 
(b)  The Neighborhood Development Overlay District is intended to encourage compatible development and redevelopment in established neighborhoods without preventing the construction of new single-family structures or the renovation, remodel, repair or expansion of existing single-family structures, and to encourage the preservation of the character, stability, and livability of the specific neighborhoods. A Neighborhood Development Overlay District imposes specific area regulations that reflect the existing character of the neighborhood. The neighborhood development overlay does not prevent construction of new single-family structures or the renovation, remodel, repair or expansion of existing single-family structures, but rather ensures that new single-family structures and the renovation, remodel, repair or expansion of existing single-family structures are compatible with existing single-family structures. A Neighborhood Development Overlay District is an additional set of regulations that apply to the existing zoning regulations of the specific area and may be either more or less restrictive than the existing zoning regulations that apply to the proposed district or a combination thereof. 
(Ord. No. 3719 ,  1, 12-8-08) 
Sec. 2. - Definitions. 
    In this article the following words and phrases shall have the assigned meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
    Architectural design characteristics mean the architectural design features of single-family structures illustrated in a pattern book and include chimneys, roof style, slope, and overhang; materials; window style; vent style; balconies; towers; wing walls; eave overhangs; window sashes; front porches; crowns; pilasters; and other exterior architectural features. 
    Blockface means the linear distance of lots along one side of a street between the two nearest intersecting streets. If a street dead-ends or ends in a cul-de-sac, the terminus of the dead-end street or cul-de-sac will be treated as an intersecting street. 
    Department means the development services department of the city. 
    Development plan means a plan drawn to scale, which graphically depicts the existing conditions of a lot or tract and which also indicates the specific elements and requirements of the article which are the subject of the requested variance(s). 
    Director means the director of the development services department, or designee. 
    District means a Neighborhood Development Overlay District. 
    Garage orientation and location means the manner in which a garage for a single-family structure within a district is oriented (towards the street, alley or the main structure), how the garage is accessed (front-entry, side-entry, rear-entry, swing-entry), and whether the garage is attached or detached and may include, for example, front-entry attached garages, rear-entry detached garages or other combinations above. 
    Height means the vertical distance of a building or portion thereof measured from the mean level of the ground surrounding the building to: (1) the highest point of the roof's surface if a flat surface, (2) the deck line for a mansard roof, (3) the mean level for a shed roof, or (4) the mean level between eaves and the ridge for hip and gable roofs. 
    Median means the middle in a set of numbers where one-half of the numbers are less than the median number and one-half of the numbers are greater that the median number. For example, 4 is the median of 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9. If the set of numbers has an even number of numbers, then the median is the average of the two middle numbers. For further example, if the set of numbers is 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9, then the median is the average of 4 and 6, or 5. 
    Neighborhood committee means ten different owners of ten different lots or tracts of land within a proposed Neighborhood Development Overlay District that have submitted an application for the creation of a Neighborhood Development Overlay District. A quorum of the neighborhood committee shall consist of seven members and the committee chair.

    Petition means a petition in a form provided by the department for all owners of a lot or tract of land on which a single-family structure is located within a proposed Neighborhood Development Overlay District to sign to indicate whether such property owner is in favor or opposition to the establishment of the proposed Neighborhood Development Overlay District.

The petition shall contain the following statement in bold print in font larger than the text of the petition: "BY SIGNING THIS PETITION YOU ARE REQUESTING THAT THE CITY OF RICHARDSON REZONE YOUR PROPERTY. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS TO USE YOUR PROPERTY MAY BE AFFECTED. YOU MAY WANT TO CONSULT YOUR LEGAL ADVISOR OR REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONAL IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS".

(Ord. No. 3719 ,  1, 12-8-08) 
Sec. 3. - Application and petition process. 
(a)  Zoning ordinance applies. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the procedures for zoning amendments contained in the City of Richardson Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance shall apply. 
(b)  General. A Neighborhood Development Overlay District may only be placed on an area that is zoned a single-family residential district and developed primarily with single-family structures. A Neighborhood Development Overlay District may be placed on an established neighborhood even though it contains vacant lots or tracts. A Neighborhood Development Overlay District may not be placed on a new subdivision being developed on a tract of land. 
(c)  District boundaries. A district must contain at least 50 separate lots or tracts of land on which single-family structures are located in a compact, contiguous area, or be an original subdivision if the subdivision contains fewer than 50 single-family structures. A proposed district with boundaries may contain fewer than 50 separate lots or tracts of land on which single-family structures are located based on unique circumstances as determined by the city council upon recommendation by staff. Boundary lines should be drawn to include blockfaces on both sides of a street, and to logical edges of the area or subdivision, as indicated by a creek, street, subdivision line, utility easement, zoning boundary line, or other boundary. Boundary lines that split blockfaces in two should be avoided. No lots along the blockface shall be excluded. Where a physical constraint, such as the presence of a creek or the lack of an alley, makes it infeasible for certain lots to meet certain requirements of the proposed district, special provisions may be developed for those lots only as described in Section 3(g) below. 
(d)  Initiation of process. A request for the establishment of a Neighborhood Development Overlay District is initiated by submitting an application to the director on a form provided by the department. The application must be signed by the owners of at least ten separate lots or tracts of land on which single-family structures are located in the proposed district and include a map of the boundaries of the proposed district. The boundaries of the proposed district must comply with the requirements of this section. The persons signing the application shall constitute the neighborhood committee. The neighborhood committee shall designate on the application a person as the neighborhood committee chair to serve as the point of contact between the neighborhood committee and the city. 
(e)  Review of application and conference. After receipt of an application, the department shall review the boundaries of the proposed district to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section, inspect the site of the proposed district and review the existing zoning regulations and any land use studies for the proposed district area. Applications for proposed districts that do not comply with the requirements of this section shall not be processed, and the department shall notify the neighborhood committee in writing of such action and reasons therefore. As soon as practical after receipt of an application and petition that meets the requirements of this section, the department shall schedule a conference with the neighborhood committee at which the department will explain the Neighborhood Development Overlay District process, the requirements of a district, and the possible regulations that may be imposed in a district. A quorum of the neighborhood committee must attend this conference. 
(f)  Initial meeting of neighborhood committee. The neighborhood committee is required to conduct at least one meeting with the property owners within the proposed district after the proposed district boundaries and regulations are identified. A quorum of the neighborhood committee must attend this meeting. The neighborhood committee shall send a written notice of the date, time, location and purpose of the meeting to all owners of lots or tracts of land on which single-family structures are located within the proposed district at least ten calendar days prior to the scheduled meeting by United States mail, postage prepaid, first class mail addressed to the property owners at the address set forth on the most recent city tax roll or hand delivered. The city shall provide the neighborhood committee the name and address of the owners of the lots and tracts of land within the proposed district based upon the current city tax roll. The purpose of the meeting is for the neighborhood committee to discuss the neighborhood committee's interest in the creation of the proposed district and to answer questions from property owners within the proposed district. 
(g)  Preparation of district regulations by neighborhood committee. After department review and approval of an application for a proposed district, the neighborhood committee is responsible for calculating the medians for the elements desired to be regulated in the proposed district, and for the preparation and development of proposed regulations for consideration and discussion at the neighborhood meeting. Where lots are unable to meet the requirements of the proposed overlay district due to physical hardships or conditions, such as the presence of a creek or the lack of an alley, such lots may be excluded from the requirements that are directly related to those physical hardships or conditions. For example, if a proposed district requires a rear-entry garage, but a lot does not have alley access, such lot may be excluded from the alley connection requirement; however, such lot must meet all of the other requirements of the proposed district unrelated to the physical hardship or condition. If regulations for architectural design characteristics are desired, the neighborhood committee shall be required, at its cost, to engage a licensed architect to prepare a pattern book for the proposed district. The neighborhood committee shall submit the proposed Neighborhood Development Overlay District regulations to the department for review to ensure compliance with this article. 
(h)  Neighborhood meeting. As soon as practical after submission of a set of proposed district regulations that meet the requirements of this article, the department shall schedule a neighborhood meeting. The department shall give written notice of the date, time, location and purpose of the neighborhood meeting accompanied by a copy of the proposed district regulations to all owners of lots and tracts of land on which single-family structures are located within the proposed district as evidenced by the last approved city tax roll at least ten days prior to the date of the scheduled neighborhood meeting. 
(i)  Conduct of neighborhood meeting. The department and the neighborhood committee shall conduct the neighborhood meeting. A quorum of the neighborhood committee members must attend the meeting. At the neighborhood meeting the department shall provide an overview of the purpose for, and the process to establish a Neighborhood Development Overlay District including the regulations proposed by the neighborhood committee for the proposed district. At the neighborhood meeting, all owners of real property within the proposed district and interested citizens shall be provided an opportunity to speak and ask questions of the department and the neighborhood committee. The department shall cause written minutes of each neighborhood meeting to be kept, including the names of persons present, any motion made, any action taken, and the record of any vote taken. 
(j)  Petition available. At the neighborhood meeting, the department shall have a petition available for each owner of real property within the proposed district. In addition, a petition may be obtained from the department. The petition shall include a map of the boundaries of the proposed district, a list of the proposed regulations, the name and address of each property owner signing the petition, and a statement that by signing the petition the signer is indicating such property owner's support or opposition to the establishment of the proposed district. The department shall also mail a copy of the petition form to all owners of the lots and tracts of land within the proposed district; however only one petition per lot or tract within the proposed district shall be accepted as described in section 3(k) herein. 
(k)  Submission of petition. The neighborhood committee and the owners of lots or tracts on which single-family structures are located within a proposed district shall have until 180 calendar days after the date of the neighborhood meeting required in section 3(j) to submit the petitions for a proposed district to the director. The director shall stamp each petition received with the date and time of filing. If the 180 th date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or city holiday, the date of required filing shall be extended to the next business day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or city holiday. Any petition filed after that date shall not be considered by the department in the determination of whether a sufficient percentage of property owners are in support of the proposed district. The petition(s) must contain the dated, notarized signatures of the owners of each lot or tract in the proposed district wishing to register support or opposition. The petition(s) in support of the proposed district must be submitted by the owners of at least 70 percent of the lots or tracts within the proposed district to initiate the public hearing process. A petition may be submitted for each lot within the proposed district indicating the support or opposition of the lot owner(s) or a petition may be submitted for one or more lots provided the signature of all owners of such lots are notarized. The petition for each lot shall contain the notarized signature of each owner. 
(l)  Verification of petition. The department shall verify the petitions and signatures. Only one petition per lot or tract within the proposed district shall be accepted. If more than one petition is submitted for a single lot or tract, the petition with the most recent date shall be considered to represent the support or opposition of the owner of the lot or tract. A proposed district for which untimely and/or insufficient petitions have been submitted shall not be processed by the department. A property owner may withdraw such owner's signature from a petition by submitting to the director a dated notarized statement of withdrawal from the petition at anytime prior to the date of the first public hearing on the proposed district before the city plan commission. As of the date and time of the opening of the first public hearing before the city plan commission, all signatures and petitions shall be considered final. Any petition submitted after the expiration of the 180-day period shall be deemed void and any subsequent request to create a district shall require a new application and petition processed pursuant to the provisions of this article. 
(m)  Petition treated as city initiated zoning. A public hearing before the city plan commission to create a district is initiated by submission of a complete petition(s) to the director. Once the required petitions have been timely submitted to the director, the proposed district shall be treated as a city-initiated zoning amendment. The notification and public hearing process applicable for a zoning amendment shall apply to the proposed Neighborhood Development Overlay District ordinance. In addition to any other required notice, at least ten days prior to the date of the public hearing before the city plan commission at which the proposed district is to be considered, the director shall mail a copy of the proposed Neighborhood Development Overlay District ordinance and a reply form to all owners of real property within the area of notification. The reply form shall allow the recipient to indicate support or opposition to the proposed Neighborhood Development Overlay District and to give any written comments. The director shall report to the city plan commission and to the city council the percentage of replies in favor and in opposition, and summarize any comments.

A new application/petition to repeal or amend a district may not be considered for a period of one year following the date of a denial recommendation by the city plan commission or a denial by the city council of an application to amend or repeal the district. 
(p)  Deviation to district regulations. Once a district is adopted, the owner of a lot or tract within the district may request a deviation to the regulations of the district by submitting to the director an application for a deviation to the district regulations accompanied by a specific development plan which sets forth the specific regulations for which a deviation is requested and includes the reasons for such deviation. The application for a variance and specific contents of development plan shall be submitted on a form as prescribed the city. Such application shall be processed in the same manner as an application for a zoning change under the comprehensive zoning ordinance except that the following additional provisions shall apply: 
(1)  In addition to the notice and public hearings required by state law, written notice of the request for deviation shall be given to all owners of lots or tracts within the district and to the owner of any property within 200 feet of the property which is the subject of the requested deviation that is outside of the district but located within the city limits; and

(Ord. No. 3719 ,  1, 12-8-08) 
Sec. 4. - Neighborhood Development Overlay District-More restrictive. 
    The provisions of this section 4 govern a district that provides for regulations that are more restrictive than the existing zoning regulations of a proposed district. 
(a)  General. A district is not required to specify standards for each category of area regulation (front setback, interior side setback, corner lot side setback, and rear setback), height, garage orientation, or architectural design characteristics as provided in this section, but if it does, the regulations must be selected from the menu of options described in this section. A district may combine or contain regulations that are either more restrictive or less restrictive than the existing zoning district regulations, or combination thereof. Except as otherwise provided in the district ordinance, the regulations of the underlying zoning remain in effect. The regulations of the district apply only to single-family structures. In the event of a conflict between the Neighborhood Development Overlay District and the regulations of the underlying zoning, the regulations of the Neighborhood Development Overlay District control. 
(b)  Front setback. The minimum front setback must be within the range between the setback of the underlying zoning district regulations and the median front setback of the single-family structures within the district. This range may require a front setback that is greater than the front setback in the underlying zoning. For example, if the minimum front setback of the underlying zoning district regulations is 30 feet and the median front setback of single-family structures within the district is 40 feet, the minimum front setback selected for the overlay district must be between 30 feet and 40 feet as illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 1a below. 

Figure 1 

Figure 1a 
(c)  Interior side setback. The minimum interior side setback must be within the range between the setback of the underlying zoning district regulations and the median interior side setback of the single-family structures within the district. This range may require an interior side setback that is greater than the interior side setback of the underlying zoning. For example, if the minimum side setback in the underlying zoning district regulations is seven feet and the median side setback of single-family structures within the district is 12 feet, the minimum side setback selected for the overlay district must be between seven feet and 12 feet as illustrated in Figure 2 below. The minimum interior side setback for each interior side yard may be separately established provided each interior side setback is within the range between the side setback of the underlying zoning district regulations and the median interior side setback of the single-family structures within the district. 

Figure 2 
(d)  Corner lot side setback. The minimum corner lot side setback must be within the range between the setback of the underlying zoning district regulations and the median corner lot side setback of the single-family structures within the district. This range may require a corner lot side setback that is greater than the corner lot side setback of the underlying zoning. For example, if the minimum corner lot side setback in the underlying zoning district regulations is 20 feet and the median corner lot side setback of single-family structures within the district is 30 feet, the minimum corner lot side setback selected for the overlay district must be between 20 feet and 30 feet as illustrated in Figure 3 below. 

Figure 3 
(e)  Rear setback. The minimum rear setback must be within the range between the setback of the underlying zoning district regulations and the median rear setback of the single-family structures within the district. This range may require a rear setback that is greater than the rear setback in the underlying zoning. For example, if the minimum rear setback of the underlying zoning district regulations is 25 feet and the median rear setback of single-family structures within the district is 35 feet, the minimum rear setback selected for the overlay district must be between 25 feet and 35 feet as illustrated in Figure 4 and Figure 4a below. 

Figure 4 

Figure 4a 
(f)  Height for single-story or two-story neighborhoods. For a district consisting of entirely existing single-story single-family structures, the maximum height of single-family structures must be within the range between the maximum height of the underlying zoning district regulations for single-family structures and the median height of the single-story single-family structures within the district. For example, if the maximum height of a single-story single-family structure in the underlying zoning district regulations is 25 feet, and the median height of the single-story single-family structures within the district is 20 feet, the maximum height of a single-family structure selected for the overlay district must be between 25 feet and 20 feet as illustrated in Figure 5 below. For a district consisting of entirely two-story single-family structures, the maximum height of single-family structures must be within the range between the maximum height of the underlying zoning district regulations for two-story single-family structures and the median height of the two-story single-family structures within the district. For example, if the maximum height of a two-story single-family structure in the underlying zoning district regulations is 40 feet and the median height of the two-story single-family structures within the district is 35 feet, the maximum height of a single-family structure selected for the overlay district must be between 40 feet and 35 feet as illustrated in Figure 5a below. 
(g)  Height for combination of single-story and two-story structures. For a district consisting of a combination of single-story and two-story single-family structures, the maximum height of a single-story single-family structure must be within the range between the maximum height of a single-story single-family structure in the underlying zoning district regulations and the median height of the single-story single-family structures within the district, and the maximum height of a two-story single-family structure must be within the range between the maximum height of a two-story single-family structure in the underlying zoning district regulations and the median height of the two-story single-family structures within the district. For example, if the underlying zoning district regulations provide that a single-family structure shall not exceed two stories in height, with the first story height limited to 25 feet and the second story height limited to 15 feet, the maximum height of a single-story single-family structure in the underlying zoning district is 25 feet and maximum height of a two-story single-family structure in the underlying zoning district is 40 feet. If the median height of the single-story structures within the district is 20 feet and the median height of the two-story structures is 35 feet, the maximum height of a single-story single-family structure selected for the overlay district must be between 25 feet and 20 feet and the maximum height of a two-story single-family structure must be between 40 feet and 35 feet as illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 5a below. 

Figure 5 

Figure 5a 
(h)  Lot coverage. The maximum lot coverage selected for a district must be within the range between the maximum lot coverage of the underlying zoning district regulations and the median lot coverage for the single-family structures within the district. For example, if the maximum lot coverage in the underlying zoning district regulation is 40 percent and the median lot coverage for the single-family structures within the district is 30 percent, the maximum lot coverage selected for the overlay district must be between 40 percent and 30 percent as illustrated in Figure 6 below. 

Figure 6 
(i)  Garage orientation and location. Garage access, connection, or location must be selected from one or more of the following options: 
(A)  Garage access of : 
(i)  Front-entry; 
(ii)  Side-entry; 
(iii)  Rear-entry; or 
(iv)  Swing-entry. 
(B)  Garage connection of: 
(i)  Attached to the single-family structure; or 
(ii)  Detached from the single-family structure. 
(C)  Garage location: 
(i)  In front of the single-family structure; 
(ii)  To the side of the single-family structure; or 
(iii)  To the rear of the single-family structure. 
The selected garage characteristics must be present in at least 70 percent of the homes in the proposed Neighborhood Overlay Development District. If there is no significant pattern to the neighborhood, this regulation shall not be proposed. 
(j)  Architectural design characteristics. The architectural design features selected for new construction, renovation, remodel, repair and expansion of single-family structures in a district shall be from the pattern book prepared by a licensed architect for the proposed overlay district. 
(Ord. No. 3719 ,  1, 12-8-08) 
Sec. 5. - Neighborhood Development Overlay District-Less restrictive. 
    The provisions of this section 5 govern a Neighborhood Development Overlay District that provides for regulations that are less restrictive than the existing zoning district regulations of a proposed district. 
(a)  General. The district regulations may specify regulations that are less restrictive than the existing zoning regulations for the proposed district as provided in section 5 above. A district may combine or contain regulations that are either more restrictive or less restrictive than the existing zoning district regulations, or a combination thereof. The categories that may be less restrictive include front setback, interior side setback, corner lot side setback, rear setback, height for single-story or two-story single-family structures, and lot coverage, but excluding garage orientation and location, and architectural design characteristics. 
(b)  The application and petition process for the creation of a proposed district with standards less restrictive than the existing zoning regulations shall be the same as for the creation of a Neighborhood Development Overlay District under section 3 above. 
(c)  In the application for the creation of a proposed district with standards less restrictive than the existing zoning district regulations, the calculation of the medians for the proposed overlay district shall be provided for informational purposes only. 
(Ord. No. 3719 ,  1, 12-8-08) 
Sec. 6. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of the comprehensive zoning ordinance the following regulations shall govern nonconforming structures within a neighborhood overlay district: 
(a)  A nonconforming structure may be renovated, repaired or remodeled provided the degree of nonconformity, including the area or size of the nonconforming structure, is not increased, except in conformance with the Neighborhood Development Overlay District. 
(b)  A nonconforming structure may not be enlarged, expanded, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the time the land and/or structure became nonconforming, except in conformance with the Neighborhood Development Overlay District. 
(c)  A nonconforming structure destroyed by fire, the elements, act of God or other casualty may be rebuilt provided the nonconforming structure is not enlarged, expanded, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the time the structure was destroyed, except in conformance with the Neighborhood Development Overlay District. 
(d)  A nonconforming structure demolished for the convenience or business purposes of the owner may not be rebuilt, except in accordance with the provisions of the Neighborhood Development Overlay District.

(b)  Where the city plan commission recommends approval as in (1), (2) or (3) above, the recommendation will be forwarded automatically to the city council and a date for a public hearing will be set. 
(c)  Where the city plan commission recommends denial as in (4) above, the application will not automatically be placed on the city council agenda unless requested in writing by the applicant within ten days after the city plan commission recommendation to deny. 
(Ord. No. 3377-A,  1, 1-14-02) 
Sec. 6. - Property owner protest. 
    If a proposed change to a zoning regulation or boundary is protested in accordance with Section 211.006 of the Texas Local Government Code, as amended, the proposed change in zoning must receive, in order to take effect, the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of all members of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 3172-A,  5, 4-13-98; Ord. No. 3377-A,  1, 1-14-02) 
Sec. 7. - Three-fourths vote required to overrule recommendation to deny. 
    The affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of all members of the city council is required to overrule a recommendation of the city plan commission that a proposed change to a zoning regulation or boundary be denied. 
(Ord. No. 3172-A,  5, 4-13-98; Ord. No. 3377-A,  1, 1-14-02) 
Sec. 8. - Appeal of city plan commission recommendation to deny. 
    Where the city plan commission makes a recommendation to deny a change in zoning classification or change in special conditions, the application will not automatically be placed on the city council agenda unless requested in writing by the applicant within ten days after the city plan commission recommendation to deny. 
(Ord. No. 3377-A,  1, 1-14-02) 
Sec. 9. - Denial with prejudice. 
    A recommendation to deny a request for a change in zoning classification or change in special conditions (as opposed to a special permit) by the city plan commission or a denial of the same by the city council is considered to be with prejudice unless specifically stated otherwise. Denial with prejudice imposes a one-year waiting period from the date of denial on any applications for a zoning change or special conditions involving the same property. Denial without prejudice will permit a substantially different application on a given piece of property with no waiting period; however, the same or a substantially similar application for zoning change shall not be considered within one year of a denial. A recommendation by the city plan commission to deny a request for a change in zoning classification or change in special conditions shall not be considered to be with prejudice if such request is appealed to the city council and there denied without prejudice. 
(Ord. No. 3377-A,  1, 1-14-02) 
Sec. 10. - Fees. 
    All applications for appeals to the zoning board of adjustment for variances from the comprehensive zoning ordinance shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee. 
(Ord. No. 3598,  20, 3-26-07) 
ARTICLE XXX. - PRESERVING RIGHTS IN PENDING LITIGATION AND VIOLATIONS UNDER EXISTING ORDINANCES 

Sec. 1. - Effect of ordinance. 
    By the passage of this ordinance, no presently illegal use shall be deemed to have been legalized unless specifically such use falls within a use district where the actual use is a conforming use. Otherwise, such uses shall remain nonconforming uses where recognized, or an illegal use, as the case may be. It is further the intent and declared purpose of this ordinance that no offense committed, and no liability, penalty or forfeiture, either civil or criminal, incurred prior to the time the existing zoning ordinance was repealed and this zoning ordinance adopted, shall be discharged or affected by such repeal; but prosecutions and suits for such offenses, liabilities, penalties or forfeitures may be instituted or causes presently pending proceeded with in all respects as if such prior ordinance had not been repealed. 
ARTICLE XXXI. - VALIDITY 

Sec. 1. - Severability clause. 
    If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, phrase, or provision of this ordinance shall be adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional, the same shall not affect the validity of this ordinance as a whole or any part or provision thereof other than the part so decided to be invalid or unconstitutional. 
ARTICLE XXXII. - WHEN EFFECTIVE 

Sec. 1. - Date. 
    The fact that the present zoning regulations are inadequate to properly safeguard the public welfare, health, peace, and safety, creates an urgency and an emergency, and requires that this ordinance shall become effective immediately upon its passage and publication, and it is accordingly so ordained.
