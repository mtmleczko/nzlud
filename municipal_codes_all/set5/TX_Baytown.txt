PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Baytown, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented through August 8, 1996, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Bobby Rountree, City Manager, Ignacio Ramirez, Sr., City Attorney, Eileen P. Hall, Assistant City Manager/City Clerk, Karen L. Horner, Assistant City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(c)  The hearing shall be conducted by the hearing official under the following guidelines. The hearing official shall liberally construe these guidelines to allow the public input to protect the health and safety of a community affected by the location of an enterprise and to allow the applicant to address these concerns: 
(1)  The hearing official may exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious. Relevance and materiality shall be evaluated by the relation of the evidence to health and safety concerns directly related to the SOBP at issue, and conditions which may be attached to the SOBP to address those concerns. The hearing is not limited to the health and safety concerns specifically identified in the hearing request. 
(2)  The hearing official shall have the power to limit any interference with the proceeding. 
(d)  After the conclusion of the public hearing, the hearing official shall produce a written statement containing the official's findings of the public health and safety concerns and recommendations for conditions to be attached to the SOBP.

When the hearing official determines that public health and safety concerns exist, the director shall attach conditions as part of the SOBP. The hearing official may consult with the director for the purposes of developing appropriate conditions to address the health and safety concerns shown at the hearing. 
(e)  If evidence is produced at the hearing that would support denial of the SOBP, the hearing official shall provide that information to the director, who shall investigate whether the evidence warrants denial or revocation of the SOBP under this article.

(c)  The enterprise or its designated agent shall have the opportunity to appear before the city council upon written request submitted to the director within ten days of delivery of the notice of revocation.

As indicated on thoroughfare plan 165' Collector: 
As indicated on thoroughfare plan 165' Local street 75' Cul-de-sac bulb 50'  
c.  When the separation requirements for nonresidential driveways cannot be met because of the location of existing public streets or driveways, joint access driveways or access easements across adjoining tracts shall be used. The city engineer may grant a specific approval for a driveway that does not meet the minimum separation requirement as noted in subsection (b)(1)b. of this section when the design engineer provides documentation showing: 
1.  The minimum separation requirements cannot be met due to existing driveway locations; 
2.  Joint access cannot be obtained, as verified by a signed and notarized affidavit from the design engineer stating that joint access cannot be obtained from adjacent property owners; and

(2)  Driveway alignment. 
a.  On streets classified in the city's thoroughfare plan as collectors, arterials, or highways that do not contain raised medians within 50 feet of the proposed driveway, the proposed driveway shall align with existing driveways on the opposite side of the street and meet the minimum separation requirements from existing driveways on both sides of the street. For undivided collector streets within industrial zoned areas, the opposite side driveway separation requirement may be waived by the city engineer based upon a review of traffic and safety conditions. Driveways must be aligned with existing median openings, or be located a distance from the median opening so that a driveway at the median opening will meet the separation requirements within this section. 
b.  At an intersection in which one public street terminates at the intersection of a connecting cross street, a driveway on the cross street in alignment with the terminating street must safely accommodate the cross section of the intersecting public street. 
(3)  Variances to access management requirements. 
a.  The planning and zoning commission, upon a proper appeal and after a hearing, may grant a variance to the access management requirements contained in subsection (b) of this section, upon finding that all of the following conditions have been met: 
1.  The minimum separation requirements cannot be met due to existing driveway locations; 
2.  Joint access cannot be obtained, as verified by a signed and notarized affidavit from the design engineer stating that joint access cannot be obtained from adjacent property owners; 
3.  Access cannot be obtained to any other public street; 
4.  Hardship is created if the property owner cannot achieve some relief from the standards; 
5.  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the property involved and which are not applicable to others; 
6.  Special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant; 
7.  Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Code to other property; 
8.  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the property; and 
9.  Granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this Code and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
b.  In granting the variance, the commission may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Code. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of this Code. 
c.  A request for a variance must be in writing and filed with the city clerk within 30 days after the decision is rendered by the city engineer. The request must include the justification for the variance, drawings providing sufficient detail to describe the request, and traffic data or any other supporting information. Incomplete requests shall be rejected until all items are addressed by the applicant. An application for a variance stays all work related to a driveway until such time as the variance decision is made.

A grantee further shall pledge that no promise or inducement, oral or written, has been made to any city employee or official regarding receipt of a franchise.

The grantee's acceptance of the obligations imposed by the terms and conditions of this article shall be as specified in the franchise. 
(4)  A grantee agrees, by the acceptance of a franchise, to accept the validity under present law of the terms and conditions of the franchise and this article in their entireties, and that it will not, at any time, proceed against the city in any claim or proceeding under present law challenging any term or provision of this article or a franchise as unreasonable, arbitrary or void or that the city did not have the authority to impose such term or condition. 
(5)  The decision of the city council concerning the selection of one or more grantees and the award of one or more franchises is final, and all applicants shall agree as a condition of application not to contest the city council's decision in any court of law or before the Federal Communications Commission. 
(6)  Nothing in this article or in section 635A of the cable act shall be construed as creating or authorizing liability of any kind, under any law, for any action or failure to act relating to cable service or the granting of a franchise by the city or any official, member, employee or agent of such authority or entity. 
(e)  Unlawful acts; penalties. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person to establish, operate or carry on the business of distributing to any person in the city any cable service by means of a cable system unless a franchise therefor has first been obtained pursuant to the provisions of this article and unless such franchise is in full force and effect. 
(2)  It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, install or maintain within any public way in the city, or within any other public property of the city, or within any privately-owned area within the city which has not yet become a public way but is designated or delineated as a proposed public way on any tentative subdivision map approved by the city, any equipment or facilities for distributing any cable service through a cable system, unless a franchise authorizing such use of such public way, property or area has first been obtained pursuant to the provisions of this article, and unless such franchise is in full force and effect. 
(3)  It shall be unlawful for any person to make any unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively or otherwise, with any part of a franchised cable system within the city for the purpose of enabling himself or others to receive any cable service without payment to the owner of the cable system. 
(4)  It shall be unlawful for any person without the consent of a grantee to willfully tamper with, remove or injure any portion of the cable system.

The rights granted by this article are subject to all franchises and permits heretofore or hereafter granted by the city council to use the public ways of the city by other public utility or public service corporations. It is not intended by the grantee of a franchise to abridge the exertion of the police power heretofore or hereafter granted to the city by the state. The grant of a franchise is subject to all ordinances and resolutions or agreements adopted by the city council as the same now exists or may be hereafter amended, revised or codified, in the lawful exercise of any other power granted to the city.

(l)  Rights and remedies. The rights and remedies of the parties pursuant to a franchise are cumulative, except as otherwise provided in a franchise, and shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other rights or remedies which the parties may have with respect to the subject matter of a franchise. A waiver of any right or remedy by a party at one time shall not affect the exercise of such right or remedy or any other right or other remedy by such party at any other time. The failure of the city to take any action in the event of material breach by the grantee shall not be construed or otherwise be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right of the city to take such action at any other time if such material breach has not been cured or with respect to any other material breach by the grantee. 
(m)  If franchise declared invalid. If, after the effective date of any franchise, any court, agency, commission, legislative body or other authority of competent jurisdiction declares a franchise invalid in whole or in part, or requires the grantee either to perform any act which is inconsistent with any provision of a franchise or cease performing any act required by any provision of a franchise, the city shall reasonably determine whether such declaration or requirement has a material and adverse affect on the franchise. When the grantee intends to exercise its rights pursuant to such declaration, the grantee shall so notify the city of such declaration or requirement. If the city determines that such declaration or requirement has a material and adverse affect on a franchise, it may send a written request to the grantee to enter good faith negotiations with the city to amend the franchise. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as a requirement for a grantee to agree to amend a franchise in the event of such preemptive declaration or action. 
(Ord. No. 8113, § 1(2), (20), 10-23-97) 
Sec. 21-33. - Franchising requirements.

(5)  Awarding a new franchise. 
a.  After examining any application submitted pursuant to procedures established in this section and as hereafter amended by the city council designed to assure the legal, financial, technical and character qualifications of an applicant to provide cable service, the city council is authorized, after a full hearing affording due process, to grant a nonexclusive franchise conveying the privilege to construct and operate a cable system within the public ways of the city. A franchise may be awarded to any applicant which in the city council's judgment will appropriately serve the public interest and whose construction and financial plans and arrangement are both feasible and adequate to fulfill the conditions set forth in this article and incorporated into any franchise granted.

(b)  Franchise fees. 
(1)  Grantee to pay city five percent of gross revenue as a franchise fee. For the reason that the public ways which are used by the grantee in the operation of its cable system within the boundaries of the city are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant of the privilege to the grantee to use such public ways is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and because the city will incur costs in regulating and administering the franchise, the grantee shall pay to the city an amount equal to five percent of the grantee's gross revenues. 
(2)  Franchise fee to be paid annually with statement verifying all collected gross revenues. The franchise fee shall be payable annually to the city, and sent to the city's director of finance. Such payment shall be made on or before the 60th day after the last day of each calendar year during which a franchise is in effect or the date of expiration or termination of a franchise, whichever occurs first. The payment shall be accompanied by a statement of gross revenues prepared by an independent certified public accountant, accounting firm or the grantee's chief financial officer verifying that the grantee's total gross revenues as defined in this article were fairly stated and that the franchise fees were calculated in accordance with this article and the franchise. 
(3)  City may examine all grantee's records to determine accuracy of amounts payable to the city. Upon 30 days' written notice to the grantee, the city shall have the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this article and the franchise. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit, which amount shall include interest as proscribed in subsection (b)(4) of this section from the date such amounts should have been paid, shall be paid within 45 days following written notice to the grantee by the city. Such notice shall include a copy of the audit report. The cost of such audit shall be borne by the grantee if it is determined that the grantee's annual payment to the city for any year was underpaid by more than five percent. 
(4)  Late payment of franchise fee to be charged interest at 12 percent. If any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the applicable dates specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section, and following ten days' written notice by the city to a grantee, interest shall be charged daily from such date at the annual rate of 12 percent or at the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is less. 
(5)  Acceptance of any payment does not constitute release of all payments due. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable under this article and/or the franchise. 
(6)  City reserves right to increase franchise fee. The city reserves the right to increase the franchise fee rate if the current federal limitations as to the franchise fee rate are changed as a result of superseding regulations, laws or court action. Any change in the franchise fee rate shall be accomplished by amendment to this article and each franchise, provided that such amendments shall be preceded by a public hearing affording due process. 
(7)  Article does not exempt grantee from other taxes. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to exempt the grantee from any lawful tax, business license, levy or assessment which is now or which hereafter be authorized by law.

Sec. 21-34. - Grantee to be bound by terms and conditions of article and franchise; procedure if conflict. 
    The grantee's acceptance of the obligations imposed by the terms and conditions of this article shall be as specified in the franchise. A grantee shall also agree to provide the cable system and all of the cable services specifically set forth in a franchise. In the event of a conflict between the franchise and the provisions of this article, the provisions of the franchise shall prevail. Failure to provide cable services as promised in the grantee's franchise shall be deemed a breach of the franchise to which the provisions of sections 21-45 and 21-46 shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 8113, § 1(4), 10-23-97) 
Sec. 21-35. - Transfers and assignments. 
(a)  The city is hereby empowered to take legal equitable action to set aside, annul, revoke or cancel a franchise or the transfer of a franchise, if such transfer is not made according to the procedures set forth in this article, or is not in the best interest of the city or the public. 
(b)  Transfer of a franchise means any transaction in which an ownership or interest in a grantee or its cable system is transferred from one person or group of persons to another person or group of persons so that control of the grantee is transferred, or the rights and/or obligations held by the grantee under a franchise are transferred or assigned to another person or group of persons. 
(1)  A rebuttable presumption that transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person, or group of persons, of 35 percent of the voting interest of the grantee or of the person exercising management authority over the grantee. Any purchases or acquisitions of the grantee's stock made by a person other than an officer or director of the grantee over a stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market of which the grantee or any affiliate of the grantee has no control, shall not be subject to the requirements of subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
(2)  A transfer is pro forma when it involves no substantial change in the ultimate ownership or control of the franchise. 
(3)  No transfer of a franchise shall occur without prior approval of the city, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(4)  The grantee shall promptly notify the city in writing of a proposed transfer and shall file with the city clerk an application for transfer of a franchise. The transfer application shall provide complete information of the proposed transaction, including a copy of the proposed agreement, details on the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee as well as any other qualifications the city can lawfully evaluate, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service. 
(5)  An application for approval of a pro forma transfer of a franchise shall be considered granted on the 31st calendar day following the filing of such application with the city unless, prior to that date, the city notifies the grantee to the contrary or the city extends such period of time for an additional 30 days. An application for approval of a pro forma transfer of a franchise shall clearly identify the application as such. 
(6)  In making a determination on whether to grant an application for the transfer of a franchise, the city council shall consider the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system, as well as any other qualifications the city can lawfully consider; whether the grantee is in compliance with its franchise and the applicable provisions of this article and, if not, the grantee and/or the proposed transferee's commitment and plan to cure such noncompliance; and whether operation by the transferee would adversely affect cable services to subscribers or otherwise be contrary to the public interest to the extent the city can lawfully consider such matters. 
(7)  No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all applicable terms of this article and the franchise and that it will assume the obligations and liability of the previous grantee under this article and the franchise, including whatever conditions that may be necessary to be prescribed by the city council that will assure such terms, obligations and liabilities will be honored and carried out by the transfer. 
(8)  Approval by the city of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this article or the franchise, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(9)  The city shall have 120 days to act upon any transfer request that is accompanied by the information required in this section. If the city fails to act on a request within 120 days of receiving the requested information, the transfer request shall be deemed granted, unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension of time. 
(10)  The city may impose a reasonable and related processing fee to cover its costs of considering and evaluating an application for transfer of a franchise, such fee not to exceed $1,500.00. 
(Ord. No. 8113, § 1(5), 10-23-97) 
Sec. 21-36. - Liability and indemnification. 
(a)  Indemnification of city in franchise operation.

It is the expressed intention of the parties hereto, both the grantee and the city, that the indemnity provided for in this subsection is indemnity by the grantee to indemnify, protect and defend the city from the consequences of the city's own negligence where that negligence is a concurring cause of the injury, death or damage with that of the grantee, its officers, agents and/or employees, and/or the grantee's joint and sole negligence. Furthermore, the indemnity provided for in this subsection shall have no application to any claim, loss, damage, cause of action, suit and liability where the injury, death or damage results from the sole or concurrent negligence of the city unmixed with the fault of the grantee. 
(2)  The indemnity provided for in this section shall expressly include, but not be limited to, indemnification by the grantee for the use, occupancy and maintenance of any of the cable system; any act or omission of any representative, agent, customer and/or employee of the grantee; the grantee's breach of any of the terms or provisions of the franchise; and any negligent or strictly liable act or omission of the grantee, its officers, agents, representatives, customers, employees or subcontractors in the use, occupancy and maintenance of the cable system. It is the expressed intention of the grantee and the city that the indemnity provided for in this section includes an indemnity to protect and defend the city from the grantee's own negligence as well as the concurrent negligence of the city when mixed with that of the grantee. If any action or proceeding is brought against the city by reason of any of the provisions contained in this section, the grantee further agrees and covenants to defend the action or proceeding by legal counsel acceptable to the city, such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld. 
(3)  In addition to the foregoing, the grantee covenants and agrees never to make a claim of any kind or character whatsoever against the city for damage of any kind that it may suffer by reason of the installation, construction, reconstruction, operation or maintenance of any public improvement, utility or communication facility, whether presently in place or which may in the future be constructed or installed, including, but not limited to, any water or wastewater mains or storm sewer facilities, regardless of whether such damage is due to flooding, infiltration, backflow or seepage caused from the failure of any installation, natural causes or city's negligence when such negligence is mixed with that of the grantee, its officers, agents and/or employees. 
(b)  Reimbursement of costs. 
(1)  By acceptance of any franchise, the grantee agrees to assume responsibility of the investigation, settlement or defense of any claim made or suit brought against the city due to any liability or potential liability incurred per the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, provided that: 
a.  The city agrees to the extent allowed by law to cooperate fully with the grantee and its insurers, and to abide by any and all terms, conditions and restrictions of the grantee's commercial insurance policies; 
b.  The city will incur no defense expenses, nor will it make any offers of settlement on any claim or suit included under subsection (a)(1) of this section, unless so authorized by the grantee and its insurers; and 
c.  The city provides the grantee written notice of its obligation to defend the city within 20 days of receipt of a claim or within ten days of receipt of a citation or summons in connection with a lawsuit. 
The grantee further agrees to assume all costs and expenses associated with defending the city against any claim made or suit brought in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, subject to the provisions of subsections (b)(1)a, (b)(1)b and (b)(1)c of this section. 
(2)  The grantee shall pay and by its acceptance of any franchise agrees that it will pay all expenses incurred by the city defending itself with regard to all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs and expenses mentioned in subsection (a) of this section, subject to the provisions of subsection (b)(1)b of this section. 
(c)  Public liability insurance. A cable operator shall maintain and by its acceptance of any franchise agrees that it will maintain throughout the term of the franchise or any renewal or extension thereof, a commercial general liability insurance policy, which coverage shall be at least as broad as ISO CG 00 01 10 93, protecting the city and all persons against liability for loss or damage for personal injury, death or property damage, occasioned by the operations of the cable operator under any franchise granted hereinafter in the amounts of: 
(1)  Five hundred thousand dollars for bodily injury or death to any one person, within the limit within a 12-month period; however, of $1,000,000.00 for bodily injury or death resulting from any one accident within a 12-month period; 
(2)  Two hundred fifty thousand dollars for property damage resulting from any one accident within a 12-month period;

(h)  No waiver of construction performance and payment bonds or letter of credit. Neither the provisions of this article nor any insurance accepted by the city pursuant thereto, nor any damage recovered by the city thereafter, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the cable operator or limit the liability of the cable operator under this article or any franchise granted pursuant hereto, or for damages, either to the full amount of the bonds, letter of credit or otherwise. 
(i)  Construction performance and payment bonds. 
(1)  Grantee shall be required to obtain construction performance and payment bonds in an amount established in a franchise. 
a.  In conjunction with subsection 21-37(a), 30 days prior to commencing construction or reconstruction of the cable system, the grantee shall be required to obtain and maintain throughout the period of construction or reconstruction, at its cost and expense, and file with the city clerk, performance and payment bonds issued by a corporate surety bond company authorized to do business in the state for an amount established in the franchise to guarantee the timely construction and activation or reconstruction of the cable system, the safeguarding of damage to private property, restoration of damage incurred with utilities and payment to all persons who performed services regarding the construction or reconstruction of the cable system. 
b.  The bonds shall include the following condition: There shall be recoverable by the city, jointly and severally from the principal and surety, any and all damages, losses or costs suffered by the city resulting from the failure of a grantee to satisfactorily complete and fully activate the cable system throughout the service area pursuant to the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise. 
(2)  Bond must be maintained through any extension of construction time limit authorized by city council. The construction performance and payment bonds shall be available throughout any extension to the prescribed construction or reconstruction time limit authorized by city council pursuant to subsection 21-37(b). 
(3)  Termination of the construction bond. At such time as the initial construction and activation or reconstruction of the cable system is complete pursuant to the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise, the grantee shall notify the city of its intent to cancel the construction bond. The construction bond may be terminated by the grantee six months from the date of notice unless the city council agrees that the bond may be terminated sooner, or the city council finds that a grantee has not satisfactorily completed initial construction and activation or reconstruction of the cable system pursuant to the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise. In the latter event, the city shall notify the grantee in writing of their specific findings, and the grantee shall maintain the construction bond until the city finds that the construction has been satisfactorily completed. 
(4)  Rights with respect to construction bond in addition to all other rights of city. The rights reserved to the city with respect to the construction bond are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this article or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such construction bond shall affect any other rights the city may have. 
(5)  Endorsement required.

(Ord. No. 8113, § 1(6), 10-23-97) 
Sec. 21-37. - System construction. 
(a)  Construction or reconstruction plan and strand map to be provided. A grantee shall submit a construction or reconstruction plan not less than 30 days prior to the date the grantee intends to commence construction or reconstruction. The grantee shall, if requested, permit the city manager or the city manager's designee to examine the cable system design details at the grantee's office for the purpose of ascertaining if the plan and design details are in compliance with the franchise. The plan shall include a strand map of the entire service area and shall clearly delineate the following: 
(1)  Areas within the service area where the cable system will be constructed or reconstructed, including a time schedule of construction or reconstruction for each year that construction or reconstruction is proposed; and 
(2)  Areas within the service area where extension of the cable system cannot reasonably be done due to lack of present or planned development or other similar reasons, with the areas and the reasons for not serving them clearly indicted on the map. 
(b)  Delay in system construction or reconstruction requires consent by city council. Any delay in the cable system construction or reconstruction beyond the times specified in the franchise shall require application to and consent by the city council. Any delay beyond the terms of the construction timetable, unless approved by the city council, will be considered a violation of the franchise for which the provisions of subsection 21-36(i) and section 21-45 shall apply. However, nothing in this section shall prevent a grantee from constructing or reconstructing the cable system earlier than required in the franchise. 
(c)  Failure to proceed with construction and/or reconstruction expeditiously is grounds for liquidated damages. Construction or reconstruction in accordance with the franchise shall occur according to the time schedule as agreed to therein. Failure to meet the time schedule shall be grounds for liquidated damages. 
(d)  Line extension policy. Extension of a cable system into any area shall be required to be accomplished within 90 days from a potential subscriber's request if the terms of any of the following conditions are met: 
(1)  Mandatory extension rule. 
a.  Residential. The grantee shall extend its cable system to any area within its service area or to any area annexed by the city after the effective date of a franchise granted by the city if the cable system has a density of at least 60 potential subscriber equivalent billing units per mile and is not served by another cable operator. The cable system extension shall be at no cost to the subscribers, other than the standard/nonstandard rates for installation. 
b.  Commercial/industrial. The grantee shall be required to extend the cable system to any commercial/industrial property which has prepaid for the grantee's costs of extending its cable system. 
(2)  Early extension. In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of cable system, a grantee shall provide, upon the request of one or more potential subscribers desiring cable service, an estimate of the costs for time and material required to extend cable service to such subscribers. Cable services may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, which shall include such estimates. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by a grantee and subscribers in the area in which service may be expanded, a grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential subscriber equivalent billing units per mile of its trunk or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 60. Subscribers who request service pursuant to this subsection will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. A grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such subscribers be paid in advance or that such subscribers give assurance of payment satisfactory to grantee. Once the requirements for service under this section are satisfied, the grantee shall be obligated to provide residential service to qualified areas within 90 days of a request. 
(3)  Additional coverage. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the grantee from serving areas not covered under this section upon agreement with developers, property owners or residents. 
(e)  Service drops. 
(1)  The grantee shall make cable service available to any subscriber within the service area upon request and at the standard installation charge if the installation requires no more than a 125-foot aerial or underground drop measured from the nearest point of a subscriber's home or place of business to the nearest active tap of the cable system. A standard installation includes any necessary street cutting or boring, one outlet and standard materials. A standard installation does not include house amplifiers or a wall fish installation. 
(2)  If making cable service available requires more than a standard installation, the grantee may charge the subscribers the standard installation charge and an amount equal to the reasonable actual labor and material costs incurred by the grantee for the additional facilities and work. 
(3)  Absent a showing by the grantee to the city manager of unusual circumstances, such as, but not limited to, street crossings, any standard installation shall be accomplished within seven business days of a subscriber's request, and a non-standard installation shall be accomplished within 15 business days of a subscriber's request. 
(f)  System construction and operation to be consistent with federal, state and city code requirements; city to observe semiannual proof of performance tests. Construction, installation and maintenance of the cable system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. The grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its cable system in a manner such that it operates at all times consistent with all laws, ordinances and construction standards of the city and state; the relevant editions of the National Electrical Safety Code and the National Electrical Code, as they affect the construction, maintenance of power supplies and communication lines, attachments and supports; and part 76 of the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. In addition, a grantee shall provide the city, upon a written request of the city manager, with the opportunity to observe the conduct of, and receive a written report of, the results of the grantee's semiannual proof of performance tests. The cable system shall not endanger or unreasonably interfere with the safety of persons or property in the service area or the unincorporated area located 5,000 feet beyond the service area which is not in another municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction. All equipment and maintenance will be of high quality. 
(g)  Additional specifications; standby power. 
(1)  A grantee shall construct, install and maintain the cable system, subject to the supervision of the city, in an orderly and professional manner using due diligence and materials of good and durable quality. All cables and wires shall be installed, where possible, parallel with and in the same manner as electric and telephone lines. Multiple cable configurations shall be arranged in parallel and bundled with due respect for engineering considerations. Underground installations shall be in conformance with all applicable codes. 
(2)  In all cable systems constructed or reconstructed after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, a grantee shall maintain equipment capable of providing standby power to be engaged automatically in the event of a power failure for 24 hours at all headend, tower and HVAC systems, and for a minimum of 11/2 hours at all trunk and distribution amplifiers or fiber optic nodes. All other cable systems shall come into compliance with these standby power requirements on the schedule specified in the franchise. 
(h)  Access to grantee's trenches by other utilities. During cable system construction or reconstruction, the grantee shall allow other entities reasonable access as determined by the city to put other compatible facilities in the grantee's trenches while the trenches are open and which do not delay or unreasonably interfere with the grantee's construction process. Any utility desiring access to the grantee's trenches shall share equally in the cost of opening and closing of trenches. The grantee shall be allowed access to the open trenches of other entities on an equitable basis. 
(i)  If city determines any part of facilities are harmful to health and safety of any person, grantee shall promptly correct. If, at any time, it is determined by the city or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction that any part of the cable system is endangering the public, including, without limitation, missing vault or pedestal covers, temporary drop cables that cross walkways, driveways or other areas, and low cables, riser problems and other violations of local or state codes and laws that are harmful to the health or safety of any person, then a grantee shall correct all such conditions, at its own cost and expense, immediately, or no later than 24 hours of receipt of notice from the city or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction. Until such conditions are corrected, the grantee shall issue suitable warnings to ensure that the health and safety of persons possibly affected are ensured. 
(j)  Grantee's cable system not to interfere with subscribers' ability to use television receiver. A grantee shall not interfere with the ability of any subscriber to utilize his television receiver for any lawful purpose. The connection of any cable input selector device or any converter to a subscriber's terminal shall not be considered as interference with the subscriber's ability to utilize his television receiver. 
(k)  Grantee to take all necessary steps to prevent accidents. A grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, take all necessary efforts to prevent accidents at its worksites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences, barricades and security personnel and, at night, suitable and sufficient lighting. 
(l)  Notice of cable construction/repair. The grantee will notify residents and businesses on affected streets of pending construction or major repairs, including any which require street or sidewalk trenching, at least 48 hours prior to commencement of such work. Notification shall be by leaving an appropriate notice at the affected residence (i.e., door hanger notice), or mailing a notice to the affected residences and businesses. In the event of any construction possibly affecting businesses and/or residences throughout the service area, a grantee shall notify such businesses or residences by first-class mail, stating the scope and duration of the proposed construction and its impacts at least 14 days prior to commencement of such work. 
(Ord. No. 8113, § 1(7), 10-23-97) 
Sec. 21-38. - Use of public ways. 
(a)  All grantee's facilities to be installed only at locations approved by city engineer. 
(1)  All poles, wires, cables, lines, conduits or other properties of a grantee to be constructed or installed in public ways shall be so constructed or installed only at such locations and in such manner as shall be approved in writing by the city engineer in the exercise of his reasonable discretion. 
(2)  A grantee or its contractors must obtain permits from the city engineer and/or other appropriate departments of the city prior to any physical work being performed on the public ways or on city-owned property. Permits will be issued to a grantee or its contractors only on approved plans which must be submitted on or before the request of the construction permit. All work will be done in accordance with the city's specifications and must comply with all applicable city construction codes and procedures. A grantee shall not place its cable system, or any part thereof, where such cable system will interfere with any gas, electric or telephone fixtures, water hydrant or main, drainage facility or sanitary sewer. 
(3)  In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and/or electric services are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain all of its cable system. For aesthetic purposes, a grantee will make every effort to utilize present utility poles and shall bury as much as possible of its cable system underground. However, for installations occurring after the effective date of a grantee's franchise, and at the time a grantee rebuilds or upgrades the cable system, all affected trunk or feeder cable (coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) must be placed underground if electric and/or telephone services are also placed underground at the time of the new installation. The aesthetics of the property will be deemed a high priority in the installation, maintenance and repairs. 
(b)  During construction, reconstruction or maintenance of system grantee shall not obstruct public ways without prior consent of authorities. In connection with the construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, repair or removal of the cable system, a grantee shall give due regard to the aesthetics of the service area and shall not obstruct, endanger or interfere with the proper use of the public ways, railways, passenger travel or other traffic to, from or within the city without prior written consent of the appropriate authorities, except in cases of emergency repairs where the grantee shall use its best efforts to minimize disruption and shall provide prompt notice to the city as soon as practicable, and, in any event, no later than 24 hours after the commencement of the emergency repair. In addition: 
(1)  All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by a grantee within the city shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any public way. 
(2)  In case of any disturbance to any public way, a grantee, at its own cost and expense and in a manner and time period approved by the city manager, shall replace and restore such public way to a condition better than or reasonably comparable to that in existence before the work involving such disturbance was done as determined by the city engineer. Restoration must be completed within a reasonable time after commencement of the restoration project. Failure to timely restore the public way shall constitute a material default of this article and will subject any franchise granted to a grantee to the procedures for termination set forth in section 21-46. 
(3)  If a grantee's cable system creates a hazardous or unsafe condition or an interference with a public way, then at its own expense, the grantee shall voluntarily, or upon the request of the city or its city manager, remove that part of the cable system that creates the hazardous condition from the subject property. Failure to timely remove the cable system as required in this subsection will be considered a material default of this article and will subject any franchise granted to a grantee to the procedures for termination set forth in section 21-46. 
(4)  If at any time the grantee disturbs the yard, residence or other real or personal property of a resident of the city, the grantee shall ensure that the resident's yard, residence or other personal property is returned, replaced and/or restored to a condition better than or reasonably comparable to that in existence before the disturbance as determined by the city engineer. The cost associated with both the disturbance and the return, replacement and/or restoration shall be borne by the grantee. The requirements imposed upon the grantee shall extend to any subcontractor or independent contractor that the grantee might employ to perform the tasks outlined in this section. 
(c)  Grantee to provide strand maps to affected utility companies of entire system prior to issuance of permit for construction or reconstruction. Strand maps are to be filed with affected utility companies. Prior to requesting the issuance of a permit for the installation of any facility or apparatus in accordance with the provisions of this section, a grantee shall file such maps with all utility companies and public agencies whose facilities are affected by such installation. 
(d)  Upon undergrounding of utility lines, grantee shall concurrently place lines underground at depth approved by city engineer. All underground facilities of a grantee in any public way or in any private easement shall be installed at such depths and locations as shall be approved by the city engineer, except with respect to such cable service lines where the grantee uses existing poles with permission from their owner, and where and so long as electric and telephone lines to the subscribers are overhead. Upon the undergrounding of the utility lines of the owner of such poles, a grantee shall concurrently (or earlier) place its facilities underground at depths and locations approved by the city engineer. Reasonable written notice of the undergrounding of wires will be sent to affected cable operators; and when possible, reasonable access to open trenches at such time as the utility lines are being placed underground will be granted. 
(e)  Relocation at request of the city. When requested to do so by the city manager for the safety or convenience of the city, its franchise holders or citizens affected thereby, or any other governmental entity, a grantee, at its own expense, shall protect, support, temporarily dislocate or temporarily or permanently remove or relocate any facilities or portion of the cable system installed, used or maintained under a franchise. It is expressly provided that whenever by reason of the construction, repair or maintenance of the relocation, lowering of the grade, widening, raising of any public way by the city or by the location or manner of construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of any public structure or facility by the city, it shall be deemed necessary by the city manager to relocate, move, change, alter or modify any of its facilities, such change, relocation, alteration or modification shall be promptly made by the grantee when ordered in writing by the city or its city manager without claim for reimbursement or damages against the city. Upon notification to the grantee as provided in this subsection, the grantee shall remove and relocate that portion of the cable system at its own expense as directed by the city. In nonemergency situations, the grantee is entitled to 48 hours' advance written notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. However, no such notice shall be required by the city in emergency situations. Emergencies will be determined by the city manager at his sole discretion. Failure to timely perform will be considered a material default of this article and will subject any franchise granted to a grantee to the procedures for termination set forth in section 21-46. 
(f)  Grantee shall obtain prior approval before altering any municipal facility; alternations to be at cost of the grantee. In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, inspection, repair or removal of the cable system, a grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the city. A grantee shall obtain the prior approval of the city before altering any water main, sewage or drainage system or any other municipal structure in a public way, because of the presence of the system in the public ways. Any such alteration shall be made by a grantee, at its sole cost and expense, and in a manner reasonably prescribed by the city. A grantee shall also be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace or repair and restore to a condition better than or reasonably comparable to that which existed before any such alteration as determined by the city engineer and in a manner reasonably specified by the city, any public way or other public place or any municipal structure involved in the construction of the cable system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of the grantee pursuant to a franchise. 
(g)  Grantee shall temporarily move its wires to permit moving of buildings or structures by third persons. The grantee shall, at the request of any person holding a moving permit issued by the city, temporarily remove, raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings or structures; provided, the reasonable expense of such temporary raising or lowering of wires is paid by such person, including, if required by the grantee, making such payment in advance; and the grantee is given not less than seven calendar days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes in nonemergency situations. However, no such notice shall be required by a benefitted person in emergency situations. Emergencies will be determined by the city manager.

When authorized, such trimming shall be limited to the area required for clear cable passage and shall not include major structural branches which materially alter the appearance and natural growth habits of the tree. The grantee shall be responsible for any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming or to the land surrounding any tree whether such tree is trimmed or removed, or for damage to property or person caused by such trimming and removal of any tree. Additionally, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, at the request of the city, replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any construction or maintenance of the cable system undertaken by the grantee with trees and shrubs of a reasonably comparable size and type, as determined in the sole discretion of the city manager.

The city engineer may extend such time as the city, in its sole opinion, deems to be necessary or prudent. 
(m)  Abandonment in place shall be done at direction of city engineer; ownership of property shall be transferred to city. Any property of a grantee permitted to be abandoned in place shall be abandoned in such a manner as the city engineer shall reasonably prescribe. Upon permanent abandonment of the property of a grantee in place, the grantee shall submit to the city an instrument in writing to be approved by the city attorney transferring to the city the ownership of such property. If such an instrument is not received within 30 days of the abandonment, the property shall automatically become that of the city.

The city shall make a written demand that a grantee comply with any provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant to this article or the franchise. The demand shall set forth the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance. If the violation, breach, failure, refusal or negligence by a grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such written demand without written proof that corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, and the violation is of a material franchise provision as detailed, in part, in subsection (a) of this section, the city may place the issue of termination of the franchise before the city council. The city shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least 20 days prior to the day of such city council meeting, a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given of the meeting and the issue which the city council is to consider.

(1)  Hear and consider the issue of whether a material violation of this article or the franchise has occurred; 
(2)  Hear any person interested therein, including the grantee; and 
(3)  Determine, in its discretion, whether or not any such material violation by the grantee has occurred. 
Any hearing by the city which concerns the assessment of substantial penalties or liquidated damages against a grantee, or the revocation of a franchise, will be conducted according to the state Administrative Procedures Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code § 2001.001 et seq. Specifically, the grantee will be provided with substantial due process, including the right to be represented by legal counsel, to introduce relevant evidence, to require the production of evidence, to compel the testimony of other persons as permitted by law and to question witnesses. A complete verbatim record and transcript shall be made of such proceeding and the cost of such record and transcript shall be borne by the grantee. 
(e)  City council may declare franchise terminated if compliance does not occur within specified period. If the city council shall determine the material violation by a grantee was the fault of the grantee and within its control, the city council may, by ordinance, declare that the franchise of the grantee be terminated, unless there is compliance within such period as the city council may fix. Such decision to terminate a franchise shall be made in writing and transmitted to the grantee within five days of the city council's action. 
(f)  Right to appeal. If a grantee is adversely affected by a decision of the city, it may appeal the action within 60 days of the city council's action to any court of competent jurisdiction. For the purposes of any action occurring in accordance with subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the parties stipulate that the record of the administrative proceeding and the decision of the city shall constitute the entire factual record.

(a)  Any franchise granted shall, at the option of city, cease and terminate 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of the grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of such 120 days, or unless: 
(1)  Such receivers or trustees shall have within 120 days, after their election or appointment fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this article and the franchise, and the receivers or trustees within such 120 days shall have remedied all defaults under the franchise; and 
(2)  Such receivers or trustees shall have within 120 days executed a franchise duly approved by the court having jurisdiction on the premise whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise, including applicable provisions of this article. 
(b)  In the case of a foreclosure or other involuntary sale of the plant, property or equipment of the grantee, or any part thereof, the grantee shall notify the city manager of such foreclosure or involuntary sale. The city may then serve notice of termination upon the grantee and to purchaser at such sale, in which event the franchise and rights and privileges of the grantee shall cease and terminate within 30 days after service of such notice unless: 
(1)  The city has approved the transfer of the franchise as provided for in this article; and 
(2)  Such successful purchaser shall have covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise. 
(Ord. No. 8113, § 1(17), 10-23-97) 
Sec. 21-48. - Waivers. 
(a)  Any provision of this article may be waived, at the sole discretion of the city by resolution or ordinance of the city council. 
(b)  A grantee may submit a written request for a waiver of the requirements of this article to the city council at any time during the franchise term. Such request for a waiver, at the sole discretion of the city council, may be set for a public hearing, and a decision shall be made within 120 days following the submission. 
(c)  The city council may authorize the economic, technical or legal evaluation of the grantee's waiver request, and the grantee shall be required to reimburse the city for any reasonable expenditure incurred by the city in connection with such evaluation.

DIVISION 3. - SPECIAL USE PERMITS 

Sec. 21-121. - Purpose. 
    This division provides the city council the opportunity to deny or to conditionally approve those uses for which special use permits are required. These uses generally have unusual nuisance characteristics or are of a public or semipublic character often essential or desirable for the general convenience and welfare of the community. Because, however, of the nature of the use, the importance of the use's relationship to the comprehensive plan, or possible adverse impact on neighboring properties of the use, review, evaluation, and exercise of planning judgment relative to the location and site plan of the proposed use are required. 
(Ord. No. 8287, § 3, 5-28-98) 
Sec. 21-122. - Permit required. 
    A building permit shall not be issued for any use to be located in a zoning district which permits that use only as a special use unless a special use permit has first been issued in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 8287, § 3, 5-28-98) 
Sec. 21-123. - Application. 
(a)  All applications for a special use permit for a telecommunications tower, antenna, or other facilities to provide a telecommunications service shall be filed with the director of planning and community development. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan which, along with the application, will become a part of the special use permit, if approved. The accompanying site plan shall provide the following information: 
(1)  Data describing all processes and activities involved with the proposed use; 
(2)  Boundaries of the area covered by the site plan; 
(3)  The location of each existing and proposed building and structure in the area covered by the site plan and the number of stories, height, roofline, gross floor area of any such building or structure; 
(4)  The location of existing drainageways, and significant natural features; 
(5)  Proposed landscaping and screening buffers; 
(6)  The location and dimensions of all curb cuts, public and private streets, parking and loading areas, pedestrian walks, lighting facilities, and outside trash storage facilities; and 
(7)  The location, height and type of each wall, fence, and all other types of screening.

A person desiring to obtain a temporary structure permit pursuant to this division shall make application for a permit to the chief building official containing the following information:

(4)  If an alternative site is proposed pursuant to section 22-122(b), the name, address and phone number of the owner of the alternative site; 
(5)  If an alternative site is proposed pursuant to section 22-122(b), a copy of the agreement, which authorizes applicant to use the property in accordance with this division;

(9)  A statement that the applicant understands and agrees to comply with all provisions of this division. 
(c)  Temporary structure permit. A temporary structure permit issued under this section may be issued only upon the determination of the chief building official that the original structure is damaged by the disaster and the requirements and conditions of this division and all other applicable regulations have been satisfied. All temporary structure permits issued shall include an expiration date on the face of the permit. 
(1)  Term. The term of the temporary structure permit allowing the temporary structure to remain in use and on-site will be six months from the date of the issuance of a temporary structure permit unless the temporary structure permit expires earlier in accordance with section 22-124(b)(3). 
(2)  Extension authorized by chief building official. After this initial term, should the chief building official determine that circumstances are such that safe and efficient reconstruction of damaged properties warrant the extension of the permit period, the chief building official may issue a single six-month extension; however, no such extension may be issued by the chief building official for recreational vehicles placed in a floodplain. 
(3)  Extensions authorized by council. Should further time extensions beyond the six calendar months granted for a recreational vehicle in a floodplain or the 12 calendar months already granted for all other temporary structures, be warranted, the city council may adopt a resolution granting, upon application by a permit holder, six-month extensions based on the chief building official's assessment that the permit holder is unable to complete the reconstruction set forth under the permit due to circumstances beyond the permit holder's control such as, but not limited to, a local shortage of building materials or properly licensed contractors. 
(4)  Automatic extension. Without requiring an extension of a previously issued temporary structure permit, a new temporary structure permit may be issued for a structure damaged by a subsequent disaster event, if that structure was previously issued a temporary structure permit which has not expired, and so long as the terms of this article were activated by the city manager to address damage caused by the subsequent disaster.

(c)  The city shall notify the permittee or registrant as soon as reasonably practicable of any claim, loss, damage, cause of action, suit or liability that the city deems to be covered by the indemnity contained in subsection (a) or (b) of this section. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to waive any legal immunities or limitations on liability of the city. The permittee or registrant shall be expressly subrogated to any rights of the city against any third party, to the extent that the permittee or registrant indemnifies the city as may be provided in this section. 
(d)  All permits or registrations shall further require the owner or operator to refill, including the repaving of any cut in any pavement, all excavations made by him within a public way, whether existing at the time such ordinance is passed or thereafter dedicated or otherwise coming into existence, in the constructing, operating, maintaining or removing of such pipeline or any part thereof. After once refilling such excavation, if the earth within the excavated area settles so as to leave a depression, the owner or operator shall make further necessary fills from time to time as ordered by the director or by the city council. The owner or operator will be required by any such permit to repair all portions of any public way in which such line is laid to the extent damaged by the owner's or operator's construction, operation, maintenance or lack of maintenance and to place the public way in as good a state of repair and condition as it was in at the time the construction, repair, adjustment, replacement or removal was commenced. Such repairs must be made to the satisfaction of the director. 
(e)  All permits or registrations issued pursuant to this division shall further require that all such work of repairing or refilling the public way shall be done under plans and specifications approved by the director and subject to his approval of the completed work. Any excavation in or along any such street or alley shall be replaced with materials of the same kind as those removed, unless the director approves of some other type of fill or material. Except for a pipeline emergency, the owner or operator shall notify the director before commencing any proposed excavation in any portion of any public way. If a pipeline emergency occurs, the owner or operator shall notify the communications department before commencing any excavation in any portion of any public way, except when necessary to prevent imminent danger to life or property. Such excavation shall not wholly close any public way, but the owner or operator shall at all times maintain a route of travel along and within such public way, which shall include any sidewalk area, except that in an emergency the director, the city manager, the mayor, the city council or any police, fire or other city public safety official may authorize a closing of any public way in order to take care of any break or leakage in the pipeline if, in the opinion of the director, the city manager, the mayor, the city council or any police, fire or other city public safety official such closing is necessary to protect the safety of the public. 
(f)  The permit or registration shall also provide that if the owner or operator fails to commence or thereafter to diligently prosecute any such repair, refilling or other work in a public way so required to be done by him within a reasonable time after being notified thereto by the director, the city may cause such work to be done at the expense of the owner or operator, and the city may recover all such expenses from the owner or operator, together with all costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

    No new pipeline shall be installed in a public way within the city limits and no existing pipeline shall be adjusted, relocated to, replaced at or otherwise moved to a position greater than 50 feet from its original position nor shall any such new or any such adjusted, relocated or replaced portion of a pipeline be maintained in a public way within the city limits without a valid permit issued by the city granted pursuant to this division. However, if an adjustment, relocation or replacement to a position is greater than 50 feet from the pipeline's original position requested by the city or another governmental agency, the pipeline owner or operator shall not be required to obtain a new permit, but shall obtain a permit or registration modification, whichever is appropriate, approved by the director. Further, it is understood that where the state, county, flood control district or corps of engineers has primary responsibility for maintenance of a public way and the owner or operator obtains a permit from that agency, the owner or operator shall be required to tender a copy of such permit and to register, rather than obtain a permit from the city, with respect to that portion of a public way for which the city does not have maintenance responsibility. Such permit shall state the public ways which are or will be affected, the points at which the pipelines cross, run or will cross or run in any public way. The term of all permits or period in which any registration will be valid shall be 30 years from the effective date of the permit, unless the city council for good cause shown approves the term for a shorter period of time. The permittee shall notify the city in writing prior to turning over the operation of the pipeline to the assignee or within ten days after closing the transaction, whichever is earlier.

However, concrete, clay, cast iron, asbestos cement, or orangeburge pipes meeting all of the applicable requirements of this Code on February 18, 2007, may continue to be used until such pipe becomes damaged, defective or deteriorated to the extent that it admits earth or surface or subsurface water or permits the escape of effluents. At such time, a private sewer line of such materials may not be repaired but must be entirely replaced with pipes made of PVC (poly-vinyl-chloride) or equivalent material as approved by the chief building official. This subsection supercedes and controls over any contrary provision contained in the plumbing code adopted in section 18-461 and as thereafter amended in section 18-462.

A notice which the United States Postal Service returns as "refused" or "unclaimed" shall not affect the validity of the notice; and the notice shall be considered delivered seven days after mailing the same. Such notice shall be sufficient if it generally describes the private sewer line's condition, gives notice that the condition is in violation of this section, and advises that repairs must be made within 365 days after receipt of such notice. Notwithstanding the above, if a private sewer line becomes damaged, defective or deteriorated to the extent that it constitutes a public nuisance, as defined in section 42-61 and prompt abatement is a public necessity, this subsection and the notice procedures contained in this division shall not apply. 
(d)  Manner of repairs or replacements. Private sewer line maintenance, repairs, and replacement must be made in compliance with all city codes, including but not limited to the city's plumbing code, adopted in section 18-461; and are subject to approval by the chief building official. Permits shall be required for the necessary work; however, permit fees for the plumbing work on the private sewer line shall be waived. Permit fees will be assessed for any work performed on a plumbing system inside a structure. 
(e)  Surcharge. If repairs to the private sewer line are not completed and approved by the chief building official within the time period specified in subsection (c) of this section: 
(1)  The city shall assess a monthly surcharge against the property, which charge shall appear on the utility bill for the address where such private sewer line is located. Such surcharge shall be $25.00 per month; and 
(2)  A person may not establish utility services after the expiration of the 365-day period specified in subsection (c) of this section for property on which a surcharge is being assessed until the repairs to or replacement of the private sewer line required by this section has been made and approved by the chief building official. 
(f)  Priority of payment. Any utility payment received after the surcharge has been assessed shall first be applied to the surcharge and then in the priority established in section 98-1 of this Code.

(1)  Terminate utility services in accordance with sections 98-62 and 98-93 of this Code; and/or 
(2)  File a lien against the property in accordance with section 98-65 of this Code. 
(h)  Reconnection. If utility service for property on which a surcharge is being assessed has been terminated and thereafter the city determines that: 
(1)  The private sewer line has been repaired satisfactorily; and 
(2)  Either: 
a.  All outstanding utility charges have been paid in full; or 
b.  The customer has agreed in writing to pay. 
1.  The accrued utility charges, including all surcharges, in accordance with a payment schedule acceptable to the supervisor of the utility billing division; and

(i)  Offense. 
(1)  A person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly: 
a.  Fails or refuses to repair his private sewer line within the period of time prescribed herein; or 
b.  Rents, leases or otherwise allows a person, other than the tenant residing on the property at the expiration of the 365-day period specified in subsection (c) of this section to occupy the property on which a surcharge has been assessed. 
(2)  It shall be an exception to subsection (1)b. above if: 
a.  The required private sewer line repairs or replacement has been completed and approved by the chief building official; or 
b.  No new utility service is established after the expiration of the 365-day period specified in subsection (c) of this section.

(b)  The city in the notice of a violation may inform the owner by regular mail and a posting on the property, that if the owner commits another violation of the same kind or nature that poses a danger to the public health and safety on or before the first anniversary of the date of the notice, the city without further notice may correct the violation at the owner's expense and assess the expense against the property.

Sec. 62-97. - City divided into blocks. 
    In order that the purpose and intent of this article be carried out and drilling for oil and gas within the city may proceed in an orderly manner and for convenience and clarity in identifying the location of approved or proposed drilling locations, drilling units shall be described by use of the state plane coordinate system (Lambert) for the south central zone of the state. For this purpose, the corporate limits have been divided into blocks containing 640 acres and being 5,280 feet square. All blocks or portions thereof, which are located within the corporate limits, are listed and described in an exhibit marked "A" styled "Lambert Coordinates Describing 640 Acre Blocks within the City Limits of the City of Baytown" below. The boundary lines of each block shall be contiguous with all adjacent blocks, as shown on such exhibit "A." Each block shall be identified, as shown on such exhibit "A," by the number of blocks distant it is located along the Lambert Coordinates north and west, north and east, south and east, or south and west from the intersection of coordinates 3,276,000 east and 708,000 north, which intersection is about 600 feet west of the city hall. For example N2E2 will identify the block which is the second block north and the second block east of the intersection of coordinates 3,276,000 east and 708,000 north.

(Ord. No. 671, § 3, 2-14-63; Code 1967, § 20-21) 
Sec. 62-105. - Drilling by other than leaseholder. 
(a)  If an application for a permit for the drilling, completion and operation of a well either for oil or gas shall be made by any person not owning or holding leases of oil or gas rights or drilling contracts from the owners of all lots, blocks or parcels of land included in or embraced within a drilling unit containing the projected bottom-hole location of the proposed well, a permit shall be issued to such applicant, his heirs, successors and assigns, only upon the conditions in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, in addition to such other conditions as may be provided for in other sections of this article. 
(b)  The permittee shall be free to enter into such contracts and agreements with the owners of such other lots, blocks or tracts as he may be able to make. If agreements are not reached with all owners of lots, blocks and tracts within the drilling unit containing the projected bottom-hole location of the proposed well, the owner of any given lot, block or tract shall have the right or option, by notice to the permittee given in writing within 30 days after the issuance of a permit for a well on the drilling unit involved, to either: 
(1)  Treat his interest as a working interest and contribute toward the actual cost and expense of drilling, completing and operating the well with all necessary appurtenances currently each month in the proportion that the number of square feet in area owned by him in the drilling unit bears to the total number of square feet embraced in the unit, and thereupon receive the same proportion of the oil produced and saved from such well or its value at the well, at the option of the permittee, and a like proportion of natural gas produced, saved and utilized or sold or the value of such at the well, at the option of the permittee; or 
(2)  Treat his interest as a royalty interest and receive, delivered free of cost in the pipeline to which the well may be connected, a share of all oil produced and saved from such well equal to one-eighth of the proportion of the whole quantity of oil and casinghead gas so produced and saved that the number of square feet in the area owned by him bears to the total number of square feet in such drilling unit or, at the election of the permittee, to receive a like proportion of the value at the well of the oil so produced, and to receive a like proportion of the gas and casinghead gas produced, saved and utilized or sold or, at the election of the permittee, the market value at the well of such proportion of gas or casinghead gas produced and sold or used off the premises or for gas sold at the well, such proportion of the amount realized from such sale. 
(c)  If any owner does not exercise the right and option provided in subsection (b) of this section, the obligation shall then be upon the permittee, his heirs, successors and assigns to make settlement with such owner on the terms provided in the option in subsection (b)(2) of this section, providing for the payment of a one-eighth royalty. If the owner of a lot, block or tract shall exercise his option under subsection (b)(1) of this section and treat his interest as a working interest, as therein provided, the permittee shall be entitled to reimburse himself for such owner's proportionate part of the cost out of such owner's proportionate part of the oil, gas and casinghead gas or the value thereof before making deliveries of products or settlement for the value thereof. If the option in subsection (b)(1) of this section is exercised by the owner of any lot, block or tract, such owner shall, within the time provided for notice of his election set forth in this section, file with the director a bond or other obligation executed by such owner as principal and by an authorized surety company as surety, in which such principal and surety agree, bind and obligate themselves to pay to the permittee, his heirs, successors and assigns, currently each month, that proportion of the actual and necessary cost and expenses involved in the drilling, completion and operation of such well that the number of square feet embraced within the lot, block or tract of such owner bears to the total number of square feet in such drilling unit, such bond to be approved by the city attorney and held by the director for the benefit of the beneficiaries therein. The failure of any such owner to timely file and obtain approval of such bond or other obligation shall be deemed to be an election under subsection (b)(2) of this section. Permits shall be issued in all cases and shall be subject to this article and upon the condition that the permittee, his heirs, successors and assigns shall make settlement in accordance with the provisions thereof. 
(Ord. No. 671, § 3, 2-14-63; Code 1967, § 20-22; Ord. No. 11,434, § 13, 9-9-10; Ord. No. 12,474, § 15, 2-13-14)

Disposal wells shall only be used for the disposal of saltwater or other materials that may be produced from the associated drilling, oil or gas operations. 
(9)  No well shall be drilled or worked over in the city without the bore hole at all times being filled with drilling fluid of a weight and viscosity as a reasonably prudent operator would use to keep the well under control at all times. 
(10)  It shall be unlawful for any person in connection with the drilling or working over operations of any well within the city to conduct any swabbing operations or to take and to complete any drill stem test except during daylight hours. Drill stem tests may be conducted only if the well effluent during the test is produced through an adequate oil and gas separator to storage tanks, and the effluent remaining in the drill pipe at the time the tool is closed is flushed to the surface by circulating drilling fluid down the annulus and up the drill pipe. The fire chief shall be informed before drill stem testing or swabbing is performed so that a city representative may be present during such operations. 
(11)  The operator of any well in any field or area within the city shall be required to set and cement a sufficient amount of surface casing to properly protect all freshwater sands as specified by the state regulatory authorities and the fire chief. A minimum of 1,200 feet of surface casing shall be set. The surface casing shall be of new or reconditioned casing and shall be set and cemented in accordance with the rules, regulations and orders of the state railroad commission for the field or area in which the well is to be drilled. Cementing shall be by the pump and plug method, and sufficient cement shall be used to fill the calculated annular space back of the casing to the surface of the ground. If returns to the surface of the ground are not realized, a temperature survey must be conducted to find the location of the cement and necessary work performed to provide cementing from the shoe of the casing to the surface of the ground. The cement shall be allowed to stand for a period of 24 hours before drilling plug. 
If more than 1,200 feet of surface casing is required, in lieu of setting the full amount of surface casing required to protect freshwater sands, the applicant may use the multistage cementing process on the next casing string. In using the multistage cementing process, sufficient cement shall be used in the stage cement job that is equivalent to the volume of the annulus from the cementing tool to the surface of the ground. If the cement does not reach the surface of the ground, a temperature survey must be conducted. If the survey shows that the top of the cement is less than one-third of the distance from the shoe of the surface casing to the surface, corrective measures must be taken. Any applicant using the multistage process must file with the director a copy of the state railroad commission letter granting such permit and an affidavit from the company performing the cementing. Failure to file either of these shall be unlawful and shall be punishable in accordance with this article. 
(12)  Before drilling and setting casing in any well for oil or gas within the corporate limits, the permittee must notify the fire chief and obtain letter(s) from the state regulatory authorities stating where the freshwater sands are to be found in the area or field in which the well is to be drilled. A copy of the state regulatory authorities letter(s) must be filed with the director and the fire chief, and the permittee must set sufficient surface casing as required. Failure to file a copy of the state water commission's letter shall be unlawful and shall be punishable under section 1-14. 
(13)  All completed wells within the city shall be equipped with Christmas tree fittings and wellhead connections, with a rated working pressure equal to or greater than the surface shut-in pressure of the well. All wellhead connections shall be assembled and tested prior to installation by a fluid pressure, which shall be equal to the test pressure of the fitting employed. 
(14)  Whenever any well is abandoned within the city limits, it shall be the obligation of the permittee to plug such well in accordance with the rules and regulations of the state railroad commission and to make any and all additional provisions or take precautionary measures prescribed by the state or the state railroad commission in connection with abandonment and plugging of the well. It shall be the further obligation of the permittee or the operator of the well to cut the surface casing off at least six feet below the surface of the ground and to place at least a 25-foot cement plug in the top of the casing and to weld the top of the casing completely shut. The resulting hole in the ground must be completely filled to the surface of the ground and duly tamped. 
Abandonment shall be approved by the city engineer after restoration of the drill site and the subsurface thereof has been accomplished in conformity with state regulations and the following requirements: 
a.  The derrick and all appurtenant equipment thereto is removed from the drill site; 
b.  All tanks, towers, and other surface installations are removed from the drill site; 
c.  All concrete, piping, wood, and other foreign materials regardless of depth, except surface casing, are removed from the drill site, unless otherwise directed by the state railroad commission;

e.  All oil, waste oil, refuse, or waste material is removed from the drill site; 
f.  Operator pays an abandonment fee in an amount set by council resolution; and 
g.  During abandonment operator shall comply with all applicable sections in this chapter. 
(15)  It shall be unlawful and an offense for any person to use, construct or operate in connection with any producing well within the city limits any crude oil storage tanks except to the extent of two steel tanks for oil storage, not exceeding 500-barrel capacity each, and so constructed and maintained as to be vaportight and each surrounded with an earthen firewall at such distance from the tanks as will, under any circumstances, hold and retain at least two and one-half times the maximum capacity of such tank. A permittee may use, construct and operate a steel conventional separator and such other steel tanks and appurtenances as are necessary for treating oil, with each of such facilities to be so constructed and maintained as to be vaportight. Each oil and gas separator shall be equipped with both a regulation pressure relief safety valve and a bursting head. 
(16)  Any person may install equipment for the purpose of secondary recovery or pressure maintenance operations or for automatic lease operations, provided that such person must comply with all safety requirements of this article and of the state railroad commission. 
(17)  It shall be unlawful for any person within the corporate limits to install any fired vessel or open flame nearer than 150 feet to any well or storage tank. 
(18)  Except in a drilling overlay district, any appurtenance that is three feet or more in height and within 300 feet of a property line or a public right-of-way shall be adequately protected by an opaque fence so constructed that it will prevent easy entry, in accordance with the Code, including the chapter 18, article XIV of the Code and the ULDC. Fences to prevent easy entry shall be approved by the director. 
(19)  The premises shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition, free from rubbish of every character, at all times during the drilling operation and as long thereafter as oil or gas is being produced therefrom. Every permittee's premises shall be kept clear of high grass, weeds and combustible trash or any other rubbish or debris that might constitute a fire hazard within a radius of 100 feet around any oil tank or producing well or to the limits of premises, whichever is the lesser. 
(20)  No prime movers shall be permitted within the corporate limits for the purpose of pumping wells, except electric motors. However, nonelectric motors may be used in an unusual hardship, with approval of the fire chief. 
(21)  Printed signs reading "danger, no smoking allowed" or similar words shall be posted in conspicuous places on each well, storage tank or battery of tanks within the corporate limits. 
(22)  Material, equipment, tools or pipe used for either drilling or producing operations at the well shall not be delivered to or removed from the well site except between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. of any day, except in an emergency; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to operations conducted in an area zoned heavy industrial under the provisions of the Unified Land Development Code. 
(23)  It shall be unlawful to block or encumber or close up any streets or alleys in any drilling or production operations, except by an ordinance duly passed by the city council permitting a temporary closing of a street or alley. 
(24)  All new flow lines shall be located underground at least 18 inches under grade from and after February 23, 2014. Warning signs shall be placed for lines carrying hydrogen sulfide gas as required by the commission and all other applicable state or federal regulatory agencies, and an identifying sign at each point where a flow line or gathering line crosses a public street, road, or fence line. Identification signs must conform to commission regulations. 
(25)  All tanks, piping and appurtenances shall comply with the requirements of NFPA 30. 
(26)  All electrical equipment, lighting, bonding and grounding shall comply with the requirements of NFPA 70.

(a)  Water meters shall be read monthly and each customer shall be billed monthly. Each water bill shall have a precalculated and stated due date, which shall be approximately 14 days from the day the bill is to be mailed. If a water account is not paid by the due date, the customer shall be charged a late charge in the amount of ten percent of the amount of the water charge, which shall be shown as the gross amount on the bill.

Sec. 98-62. - Procedures and remedies for nonpayment of bills. 
(a)  If any person shall permit any waste or use of water contrary to law, the city reserves the right to cut off and discontinue water service until all past due charges have been paid and any required deposit has been made and further until any and all objectionable conditions pertaining to the waste or use of water have been corrected to the satisfaction of the director of finance. 
(b)  If the water meter has been turned off for nonpayment of charges for water services and it is turned on again by anyone other than authorized personnel a $35.00 broken lock fee will be assessed. If it becomes necessary to pull the meter, an additional $65.00 pull meter fee will be added to the account. If when, in the opinion of the utility billing manager, the turning off of the water at the curb stop or removal of the meter or the locking of the curb stop is not sufficient protection for the city against the use of water, waste or misuse of water, the utility billing manager may cause the water to be cut off and the service line to be cut and plugged. If the meter technicians have to pull an illegal "straight line," the police will be called and a $185.00 pull straight line fee assessed. Upon a reapplication for water service all applicable fees and unauthorized consumption must be paid. 
(c)  If the water meter has been turned off for nonpayment of charges for water or sanitary sewer services and the customer has complied with the requirements of the city and is entitled to have the water turned on again, the following reconnection charges will be made, as applicable: 
(1)  If the service is to be reconnected at the customer's request between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. of any weekday from Monday through Friday, except holidays authorized by the city council for city employees, there is no additional charge; or 
(2)  If the customer requests that service be reconnected at any other time than that stated in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the charge will be $50.00. 
(d)  If any person gives the city a check for the payment of water services that is not honored by the drawee bank for any reason or an automatic bank withdrawal is returned unpaid, the city reserves the right to cut off and discontinue water service until all charges due have been paid, including, but not limited to, the processing fee established in section 2-619 of this Code. 
(e)  If any person damages or destroys any city property used for measuring or distributing water, the director of finance shall collect from such person a sum equal to such destroyed or damaged property, but not less than $10.00. A $35.00 service charge will also be assessed to make the needed repairs. 
(f)  Customers may request their meters be reread once a year at no charge. Subsequent requests will be assessed a $10.00 reread meter fee, if the reading is accurate. If the reading is incorrect, no fee will be assessed and the account will be adjusted to reflect the correct reading. If any person requests that his water meter be tested, the city utility billing division shall test the meter. If the meter test shows that the meter registers more water than actually consumed, the last bill shall be corrected according to the test result, and the meter shall be repaired or replaced. If the meter test shows that the meter correctly registers or registers less water than actually consumed, the customer shall be charged a meter test fee. The meter test fee for five-eighths-inch and one-inch meters is $25.00. Meter tests for meters larger than one inch will be billed actual cost. 
(g)  Any or all of the charges and fees provided by this section may be included in the regular or special billing of the city utility billing division and shall be in addition to all other charges or fees provided by this article. 
(h)  It shall be unlawful for any person to hinder or interfere with any utility billing division employee or agent who is delivering water termination notices pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of this section. It shall further be unlawful for any person, other than an occupant of the premises to which notice is delivered, to remove a water termination notice delivered by the utility billing division from any premises to which the utility billing division delivered that notice. 
(i)  Nonemergency termination. 
(1)  Generally. Whenever the city is authorized to terminate a customer's water services against that customer's consent and under this section or whenever the city otherwise terminates water services to a customer in a nonemergency situation other than by the customer's request, the city shall first provide notice in the form and manner described in this subsection to the customer and shall afford the customer an opportunity for a hearing in the form and manner described in this subsection before the termination of the services. If, after the city has complied with the notice requirements as described in this subsection, the customer does not request a hearing for review of the termination within the specified time, the city may terminate water services to the customer on the day and at the time specified in the notice to the customer or within five calendar days thereafter. Any time elapsing after the declared termination date, the elapsing of which is due to the pendency of a hearing or the extension of time granted pursuant to a hearing, shall not be considered when calculating the five days in which the city may terminate water after a declared termination date. 
(2)  Notice. Notice must be sent to a water customer at least eight days prior to the proposed termination date of the services to that customer if notice is sent by mail, or at least five days prior to termination if notice is delivered by the utility billing division. The notice may be incorporated into the customer's monthly bill, sent by certified letter, or hand delivered to the customer by a utility billing division employee or other person designated by the city to deliver such notices. The notice must be written and clearly communicate the following information: 
a.  The name of the customer whose service is proposed to be terminated; 
b.  The address where service is proposed to be terminated; 
c.  The reason for the proposed termination, including the amount of delinquency, if nonpayment of charges is the reason for termination; 
d.  The day and time on which the water service will be terminated, unless conditions bringing about the termination are sooner remedied; 
e.  The customer has the right to appear and be heard at a hearing to contest the proposed termination prior to the date of termination; 
f.  The means by which the customer may arrange for such a hearing; and 
g.  The date by which the customer must request and set the hearing in order to receive it, which deadline may be no earlier than one day prior to the termination date, nor may that deadline ever be sooner than five days from the date of sending the notice, the five days not including weekdays on which city offices are closed or holidays. 
(3)  Affidavit of failure to receive notice. After the deadline for requesting a hearing, as described in subsection (i)(2)g of this section, has passed, a customer may still request a hearing to review the decision to terminate the customer's water service within ten days of the deadline upon presentation to the city manager of an affidavit declaring that the customer, through no fault of that customer, did not receive notice of termination in time to act upon the notice. When a hearing pursuant to this subsection is requested, the city manager shall as soon as practicable make a determination of whether the appeal appears to be meritorious, and if the city manager finds it is meritorious the city manager shall order the continuation or restoration of services pending the appeal. If the hearing officer finds in favor of the customer, the hearing officer may order restoration of service. 
(4)  Notice to tenants. If the customer to whom water service is proposed to be terminated is a landlord who supplies water services to tenant water users, the city shall attempt to give notice to the tenant water users pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of this section. 
(5)  Hearing. If any customer requests a hearing to review the decision to terminate that customer's water services, the hearing shall be presided over by the city manager or any fair and neutral person he may appoint, which person must be of managerial employment and not involved in the original decision to terminate services, in this context known as the hearing officer. The hearing shall be held no sooner than the next business day or later than 15 business days after being requested by the customer. The hearing officer may in his discretion delay or advance the hearing time upon showing of good cause by the customer. At the hearing the customer shall be given the opportunity to be heard in person to present the customer's case, to present testimony from other persons and to admit documents. The customer may be represented by counsel, though the city shall not provide counsel to the customer. The customer shall be given the opportunity to confront and cross examine any witnesses appearing against him at the hearing. The customer may request that a representative of the utility billing division be present at the hearing and be subject to questioning. However, the rules of evidence or procedure for civil or criminal trials need not be enforced. The city's reasons for terminating the customer's water service shall be stated at the hearing. Upon reaching a final decision, the hearing officer shall state his reasons for reaching that decision and shall state the evidence on which the hearing officer relied in reaching those conclusions. If the hearing officer finds in favor of the customer, the customer's water service shall continue. If the hearing officer finds against the customer, the customer's water service shall be terminated. The hearing officer shall have the power to grant extensions, modify billings and fashion other reliefs as would be equitable. 
(j)  When the water meter has been turned off for nonpayment of charges for water service, sanitary sewer service, garbage collection service or if the water meter has been turned off for payment of utility services with a check that is not honored by the drawee bank for any reason, a cutoff fee will be charged in the amount of $35.00. Nonresidential customers whose doors are tagged prior to disconnection will be assessed a $25.00 tag door fee. When it is necessary to tag tenant's doors of a multifamily residential development prior to disconnection, a $100.00 tag apartments fee will be imposed.

Sec. 98-63. - Metering water bypassing sewer system. 
(a)  Any commercial, industrial, multiunit, public utility or public school owning or having control of property on which there is located one or more facilities requiring water and such water provided to any one or more of such facilities is not discharged into the city sanitary sewer system may, at the owner's own expense, have installed by the city a water meter of a type and design and at a location approved by the director of utilities. 
(b)  Any facility that does not discharge into the city's sewer system when the water is furnished by the city's water system shall be metered by a city water meter connected to a separate service line from the city water main and located in the utility easement, upon the making of application therefor by the owner of such property and making the required deposits and paying the cost of meter installation and tap fees provided for by this article. Such meter shall be read by the city's meter readers and will be subject to the established water rates and charges of the city the same as any other metered water connection to a city main. 
(c)  No person shall be allowed to disconnect a water meter that meters a facility not discharging into the city's sanitary sewer system as stated in this section and then reconnect such meter to the city's water system within a 12-month period. 
(d)  Any person representing to the city that the facility for which a meter is installed, under this section, does not discharge waste into the city's sanitary sewer system when in fact it does or any person having facilities for which such a meter is installed who subsequently connects such facility to the city's sanitary sewer system without notifying the director of utilities shall be punishable as provided in section 1-14.

Sec. 98-64. - Study to determine charge when portion of water bypasses sewer. 
(a)  This section shall apply to those water users stated in section 98-63 who have facilities connected to the city sanitary sewer system and who make application to the director of utilities under this section. 
(b)  Any water user owning or having control of property on which there is located one or more facilities requiring water and such water provided to any such facility is not discharged into the city sanitary sewer system may make application to the director of utilities requesting that a study of the applicant's property and facilities be made for the purpose stated in this section and paying the fee required in this section. 
(c)  Requests for service under this section shall be made to the director of utilities. The applicant shall furnish all the information and other matters requested therein. The fee for making any study under this section shall be $35.00. No fee shall be required for studies initiated by the director of utilities subsequent to the first application. The fee is to reimburse the city for the expense of making the study. Each applicant shall agree, as a condition precedent to the director of utilities conducting the study and tests provided for in this section, including those initiated by the director of utilities, to indemnify and hold harmless the city from any and all such liability for any act or omission by the city, its agents and employees committed while conducting the studies and tests, causing or resulting in damages to the property or person of the applicant, his agents, employees and invitees. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a request and the fee required in this section, the director of utilities will, as soon as possible, make a study of the applicant's property and facilities. When, in the opinion of the director of utilities, based upon a study of the property and facilities of the applicant, it is impractical or unfeasible for the applicant to install one or more meters to measure the amount of water passing through the water meter serving such property and not being discharged into the city sanitary sewers, the director of utilities is authorized to deny such request. 
(e)  The director of utilities is authorized, at his discretion or on written request from an applicant, to make such additional studies from time to time of any such property and facilities to check the current accuracy of the filed study on any such property, and a new study based upon the latest available data shall be filed with the director of utilities to replace the prior one. No change in the basis of computing the sewer service charge for any property will be made until the first billing date after the filing by the director of utilities of the first or any subsequent report. Requests by an applicant for a restudy under this subsection will not be accepted or acted on more often than once in every 12-month period (annually) subsequent to the filing of the first report on the applicant's property. 
(f)  If it is necessary that certain testing instruments be installed or that existing equipment or facilities located on the applicant's property be altered, adjusted, disconnected or temporarily moved in order to facilitate the making of an engineering study or test under this section, all of such shall be done by and at the expense of the applicant.

The lien shall secure the charges made by the city for the services rendered to that property. Such a lien shall be filed pursuant to the authority granted in Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 1175, § 11; V.T.C.A., Local Government Code §§ 51.072 and 402.017; and state constitution article XI, section 5. The lien shall bear interest at a rate of ten percent per annum. The supervisor of the utility billing division shall add to any lien filed pursuant to this section that amount of the filing fee charged by the county clerk for filing that lien. The lien shall be effective against that property if the account holder or user of services at that property was either the owner of that property, a tenant of that property or a permissive holder of that property or an adverse possessor of that property.

The city manager shall authorize the release of the lien if the property owner or account holder shows that no bill for the services to this property encumbered by the lien is owing or if the property owner shows that the encumbered property is and at all times, from the hour of filing of the lien until the time of the appeal, has been a homestead as defined by the state constitution. The city manager may modify or release the lien to reflect the true amount of delinquency in payment for services to the property if the owner or account holder demonstrates that a lesser bill is owing than the lien alleged or if the supervisor of the utility billing division cannot show that all the lien alleged is owing. The person last listed on the tax records of the county in which the property is located as being the owner of any given piece of property shall be presumed to be the owner for purposes of this subsection, and the address listed for the owner on the tax records shall be presumed to be the address of the owner. 
(g)  Reconnection of services. No water, garbage or sewer services shall be provided to property encumbered by a lien filed pursuant to this section, except as otherwise required by V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 552.0025.

Employees or agents of the city shall not accept payment of the water bill from any such owner, occupant, tenant or lessee without collecting the full amount of the bill, including the sanitary sewer service charge. 
(b)  If the sewer service charge is not paid by the due date shown on the customer's water bill, the customer shall be charged a late charge in the amount of ten percent of the amount of such sewer charge, which shall be shown as the gross amount on such bill; if not paid by the next billing date, such gross amount will be shown in arrears on the customer's bill for the next month following. If the total amount of the following month's sanitary sewer charges, including arrears and current sanitary sewer service, is not paid by the due date specified on such month's bill, ten percent of the following month's sewer service charge shall be added as a late charge, and the total of the two months' charges will then be in arrears. A notice will be sent to a customer showing the total amount due and specifying a cutoff date for the discontinuance of water service or sewer service. If the account is not paid in full by such cutoff date, the city shall reserve the right to cut off and discontinue water service and sewer service until all past due charges have been paid, together with applicable reconnection charges. 
(c)  A person not connected to the city waterworks system and not owing water service charges will be billed by the utility billing division for sanitary sewer services on an individual basis.

    Natural outlet means any outlet into a watercourse, ditch, lake or other body of surface water or groundwater. 
    New source means any building, structure, facility or installation from which there is or may be a discharge of pollutants, the construction of which commenced after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under section 307(c) of the act which will be applicable to such source if such standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section, provided that (i) the building, structure, facility or installation is constructed at a site at which no other source is located; (ii) the building, structure, facility or installation totally replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source; or (iii) the production or wastewater generating processes of the building, structure, facility or installation are substantially independent of an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source should be considered. Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria of subsections (i) through (iii) of this definition but otherwise alters, replaces or adds to existing process or production equipment. Construction of a new source has commenced if the owner or operator has:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 10,322, § 6, adopted May 11, 2006, repealed the former § 98-167, and enacted a new § 98-167 as set out herein. The former provisions pertained to affirmative defenses to upsets and derived from Code 1967, § 34-65(a); Ord. No. 6191, § 15, adopted March 26, 1992; Ord. No. 8118, § 1, adopted Oct. 23, 1997. 
Sec. 98-168. - Affirmative defenses to bypass. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. 
    Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Notice. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. If ten days' notice is not possible, the industrial user shall submit notice as soon as possible. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the director within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the need for the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may at his discretion waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under this section. 
(2)  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section and the industrial user complies with the notice requirements of subsection (c) of this section. 
(e)  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of a nonprohibited bypass shall have the burden of proving the occurrence to a preponderance of the evidence.

(a)  Whenever the director has proposed to take any enforcement action against any user pursuant to the provisions of this article, other than an emergency suspension or a cease and desist order, or termination of a discharge, the director shall first provide notice in the form and manner described in subsection (b) of this section to the user and afford the user an opportunity for a hearing in the form and manner described in this section before the enforcement action is taken. If, after the director has complied with the notice requirements as described in subsection (b) of this section, the user does not request a hearing for review of the enforcement action within the specified time, the director may take the enforcement action on the day specified in the notice to the user, or at any time thereafter. 
(b)  Notice must be sent to the user at least eight days prior to the proposed date of the proposed enforcement action, if notice is sent by mail, or at least five days prior to the proposed enforcement action, if notice is delivered by the director. The notice may be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or hand delivered to the user by a person designated by the director to deliver such notices. The notice must be written and clearly communicate the following information: 
(1)  The name of the user against whom the enforcement action is proposed to be taken; 
(2)  The address of the user against whom the enforcement action is proposed to be taken; 
(3)  The reason for the proposed enforcement action including the date and general nature of the alleged violation of this article; 
(4)  The nature of the proposed action, and the date and time that the proposed enforcement action will take place, including the amount of the fine which could be imposed; 
(5)  The user has the right to appear and be heard at a hearing to show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken; 
(6)  The means by which the user may arrange for such a hearing; and 
(7)  The date by which the user must request and set the hearing in order to receive it, which deadline may be no earlier than one day prior to the date of the proposed enforcement action, nor may that deadline ever be sooner than five days from the date of sending of the notice, the five days not including weekdays on which city offices are closed for holidays. 
(c)  After the deadline for requesting a hearing as described in subsection (b) of this section has passed, a user may still request a hearing to review the proposed enforcement action within ten days of the aforementioned deadline, upon presentation to the city manager of an affidavit declaring that the user, through no fault of that user, did not receive notice of the proposed enforcement action in time to act upon the notice. When a hearing pursuant to this subsection is requested, the city manager shall as soon as practicable make a determination of whether the appeal appears to be meritorious, and if the city manager determines that it is meritorious, the city manager shall order that the proposed enforcement action be postponed pending the appeal. 
(d)  If any user requests a hearing to review the decision to take an enforcement action against that user, the hearing shall be presided over by the city manager or any fair and neutral person he may appoint, which person must be of managerial employment and not involved in the original decision to take the proposed enforcement action, in this context known as the hearing officer. The hearing shall be held no sooner than the next business day nor later than 15 business days after being requested by the user. The hearing officer may, in his discretion, delay or advance the hearing time upon showing of good cause by the user. At the hearing, the user shall be given the opportunity to be heard in person to present the user's case, to present testimony from other persons, and to admit documents. The user may be represented by counsel, though the city shall not provide counsel to the user. The user shall be given the opportunity to confront and cross-examine any witnesses appearing against him at the hearing. The user may request that a representative of the utilities department be present at the hearing and be subject to questioning. However, the rules of evidence or procedure for civil or criminal trials need not be enforced. The city's reasons for the proposed enforcement action shall be stated at the hearing. Upon reaching a final decision, the hearing officer shall state his reasons for reaching that decision and state the evidence on which the hearing officer relied in reaching those conclusions. If the hearing officer finds in favor of the user, the proposed enforcement action shall not take place. The hearing officer shall have the power to grant extensions, modify orders and fashion other reliefs as would be equitable and consistent with applicable regulations and laws promulgated by the United States, the state or any administrative agency thereof. 
(e)  At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded. A transcript of the hearing will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges for such transcription.

Sec. 98-197. - Emergency suspensions. 
(a)  The director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and permit of an industrial user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW or the environment. 
(b)  Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service or the permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. If a user fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as he deems necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The director shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in section 98-198 are initiated against the user. 
(c)  An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit to the director a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence prior to the date of the hearing described in section 98-193, or within the time period allowed for requesting such a hearing if no hearing is requested.

(a)  Notice from nondomestic users. Under this article, every nondomestic user must notify the director of the nature and characteristics of its wastewater prior to commencing the discharge. The director is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose. 
(b)  Control of contributions to POTW. The POTW shall have legal authority to control through permit, order or similar means, the contribution to the POTW by each industrial user to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. For significant industrial users under 40 CFR 403.3(t), this control shall be achieved through permits or equivalent individual control mechanisms issued to each such user. 
(c)  Wastewater survey. Every industrial user shall complete a wastewater discharge permit application/survey approved by the director within 30 days of written instruction to do so by a city official. 
(d)  Permit required; effect of permit. It shall be unlawful for any categorical or significant industrial users to discharge wastewater, either directly or indirectly, into the city's sanitary sewer system without first obtaining an industrial user pretreatment permit from the director. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a permit shall be deemed a violation of this article. Obtaining a permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to obtain other permits required by federal, state or local law. 
(e)  Denial or conditions of new or increased contributions. The POTW shall have legal authority to deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants, to the POTW by industrial users where such conditions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit. 
(f)  Additional users requiring permit. The director may require that other industrial users, including liquid waste haulers, obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article. 
(g)  Users outside city limits. Any industrial user located beyond the city limits, including, but not limited to, extrajurisdictional industrial users, shall submit a permit application in accordance with this article within 30 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives. Any new industrial user located beyond city limits shall submit such applications to the director 60 days prior to discharging into the sanitary sewer. Upon review and approval of such application, the director may enter into a contract with the user which requires the user to subject itself to, and abide by, this article, including all permitting, compliance monitoring, reporting and enforcement sections of this article. 
(h)  Existing connections. Any significant industrial user which discharges nondomestic waste into the sanitary sewer system prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall within 90 days after such effective date, apply to the director for a wastewater discharge permit and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 180 days from and after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives, except in accordance with a permit issued by the director. 
(i)  New connections. Any significant industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging nondomestic wastes into the sanitary sewer system must obtain a pretreatment permit prior to beginning or recommencing such discharge. An application for this permit must be filed at least 90 days prior to the anticipated startup date. 
(j)  Certification statement. All permit applications must contain the following certification statement and shall be signed in accordance with subsection (k)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person who manages the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(k)  Signatures on certification statement. The certification statement required in subsection (j) of this section shall be signed by the following: 
(1)  A responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user submitting the reports is a corporation. For the purpose of this subsection a responsible corporate officer means: 
a.  A president, secretary, treasurer or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person with similar policy- or decision-making responsibilities for the corporation; or 
b.  The manager of one or more manufacturing, production or operation facilities employing more than 250 persons or having gross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25,000,000.00, in second quarter 1980 dollars, if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated; 
(2)  A general partner or proprietor if the industrial user submitting the reports is a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively; 
(3)  The principal executive officer or director having responsibility for the overall operation of the discharging facility if the industrial user submitting the reports is a federal, state or local governmental entity, or its agents; 
(4)  A duly authorized representative of the individual designated in subsection (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section if: 
a.  The authorization is made in writing by the individual described in subsection (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section; 
b.  The authorization specified either an individual or a position having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the industrial user discharge originates, such as the director, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and 
c.  The written authorization is submitted to the director. 
(5)  If an authorization under subsection (k)(4) of this section is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of subsection (k)(4) of this section must be submitted to the director prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.

DIVISION 6. - REPORTING AND SAMPLING 

Sec. 98-351. - Baseline monitoring reports. 
    Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the city POTW shall be required to submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in the following sections. Where reports containing this information already have been submitted to the director of EPA, region 6, in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140(b) (1977), the industrial user will not be required to submit this information again. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in subsections (1) through (5) of this section. New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections (4) and (5) of this section. The information required is as follows: 
(1)  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owner; 
(2)  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
(3)  Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production and standard industrial classification of the operation carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes; 
(4)  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
a.  Regulated process streams; and 
b.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
The director may allow for verified estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. Such estimates shall be verified by a certified professional engineer; 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants: 
a.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process; 
b.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis, identifying the nature and concentration or mass, where required by standard or director, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations; 
c.  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The director may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is not feasible due to the nature of the operation. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates to a reasonable certainty that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged; 
d.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection; 
e.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the director; 
f.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the 40 CFR 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using methodology approved by the administrator; 
g.  The director may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; 
h.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW; 
(6)  Certification. A statement shall be submitted and reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user, as defined in this article, and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional O&M or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements; and 
(7)  Sampling and analysis. All sampling and analysis required by this division shall be performed by an independent laboratory that has been approved by the director. All costs of such sampling and analysis shall be borne by the user.

Sec. 98-362. - Reports required for nonsignificant/minor users. 
(a)  Effect of permit endorsement. Under this article, a permit endorsement is issued to an industrial user that certifies no industrial wastewater is discharged to the city's sanitary sewer. The permit is issued based on that certification. 
(b)  Noncategorical industrial users. All industrial users not identified as categorical industrial users under 40 CFR 403.6 and 40 CFR chapter I, subsection N must maintain a written log of all waste material that goes to an offsite disposal facility. The log shall be available for inspection by the industrial wastewater service for a minimum of three years after the waste material has left the user's facility. If any process changes, including discharging wastewater from any new or existing process to the sanitary sewer, application must be made at least 30 days prior to the proposed change. 
(c)  Categorical industrial users. 
(1)  All industrial users subject to federal categorical pretreatment regulations are required to submit semiannual compliance reports. During the months of June and December, it is required that a report be submitted to the director with a certification that no regulated wastestreams were discharged to the sanitary sewer during the preceding six-month reporting period. 
(2)  If any person plans to begin discharging industrial waste from any regulated process operation to the city's sanitary sewer system, it is a requirement of 40 CFR 403.12(b) that existing sources that become indirect dischargers after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard must submit a baseline monitoring report to the director at least 90 days prior to the commencement of discharges to the POTW. The report must provide information on the method of pretreatment the user proposes to meet applicable standards. For new sources, the industrial user may provide estimates of the production, flow and the quality and presence of regulated pollutants in its wastestream. 
(3)  All industrial users subject to federal categorical pretreatment regulations must maintain a written log of all waste material that goes to an off-site disposal facility. The log shall be available for inspection by the industrial wastewater service for a minimum of three years after the waste material has left the user's facility. 
(Code 1967, § 34-59(l); Ord. No. 6191, § 9, 3-26-92; Ord. No. 8118, § 1, 10-23-97) 
Sec. 98-363. - Notification of violation. 
(a)  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation of the applicable pretreatment standards, the user shall notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if the director performs sampling of the industrial user: 
(1)  At a frequency of at least once per month; or 
(2)  Between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(b)  Any repeat sampling and analysis required by this section shall be performed by an independent laboratory acceptable to the director. All costs of such repeat sampling and analysis shall be borne by the user. 
(Code 1967, § 34-59(m); Ord. No. 6191, § 9, 3-26-92; Ord. No. 8118, § 1, 10-23-97) 
Sec. 98-364. - Analytical requirements. 
    Under this division, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the 40 CFR 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator. 
(Code 1967, § 34-59(n); Ord. No. 6191, § 9, 3-26-92; Ord. No. 8118, § 1, 10-23-97) 
Sec. 98-365. - Method of sample collection. 
(a)  Sampling of the effluent of waste discharges may be accomplished manually or by use of mechanical equipment to obtain a composite sample which would be representative of the total effluent. Samples shall be taken at six-month intervals to establish the BOD and suspended solids of the industrial waste or at such intervals as determined by the director as necessary to maintain a control over the discharges from the permittee. The method used in the examination of all industrial wastes to determine BOD, TSS, chlorine demand and prohibited wastes shall be as set forth in 40 CFR 136. 
(b)  Subsection (a) of this section is not applicable in connection with the following: 
(1)  A permit application; 
(2)  A demonstration of compliance after violations of any discharge standard; or 
(3)  Permit requirements of a permittee which specify sampling frequency. Tests made on representative samples collected by the director shall be made at such intervals as the director may designate, so long as samples are taken not less than on an annual basis. 
(c)  Samples may be taken and tests made at the director's option without notice to the permittee, and such test results made by the director shall fix the applicable user charge established in this article. However, with regard to establishment of user charges, a permittee may request in writing for permission to conduct self-monitoring by an independent laboratory approved by the director. Such request must be approved in writing by the director. If approved by the director, all costs of such composite sampling and analyses shall be borne by the permittee. The director's approval of sampling analyses performed by an independent laboratory does not prevent representatives of the department from taking additional samples at its option without notice to the permittee. The director may use the self-monitoring results in determining the user charge. 
(d)  Written notice from the director approving sampling and analyses by an independent laboratory to establish user charges under this article may be canceled by the director by giving written notice of such cancellation to the permittee. 
(e)  Sampling shall be conducted according to methods acceptable to the director. If, after receiving the permit application, the director determines the operations or characteristics of the producer's industrial waste discharge require composite sampling, the director may require same, which shall be provided by the producer on the basis of an average workday. Otherwise, the analysis will be made on the basis of grab samples. 
The discharge parameter values for which reports are required must be determined by one of the standard analytical test procedures incorporated by reference, and described in, 40 CFR 136.3, tables IA, IB, IC, ID and IE, or by an alternate test procedure that has been approved by the director under the provisions of 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5. Under certain circumstances, 40 CFR 136.3(b) or (c), or 40 CFR 401.13, other test procedures may be used that may be more advantageous when such other test procedures have been previously approved by the administrator, and providing the director does not object to the use of such alternate test procedure. 
(f)  Under certain circumstances, the administrator may approve, upon recommendation by the director of the Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio, additional/alternate test procedures for nationwide use. 
(g)  Sample preservation procedures, container materials and maximum allowable holding times for parameters cited in tables IA, IB, IC, ID and IE of 40 CFR 136.3 are prescribed in table II, 40 CFR 136.3. Any person may apply for a variance from the prescribed preservation techniques, container materials and maximum holding times applicable to samples taken from a specific discharge. Application for variances must be made in writing to the administrator. Sufficient data should be provided to assure such variance does not adversely affect the integrity of the sample. Such data will be forwarded by the regional administrator to the director of the Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory in Cincinnati, Ohio, for technical review and recommendations for action on the variance application. Upon receipt of the recommendations from the director of the Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory, the administrator may approve a variance applicable to the specific discharge by the applicant. A decision to approve or deny approval of a variance will be made within 90 days of receipt of the application by the administrator. Upon approval by the administrator, the applicant may then present the request for the variance to the city council.

Subdivision III. - Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activity 

Sec. 98-550. - Purpose. 
(a)  During the construction process, soil becomes the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. This eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality, and silting the aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches, and the dredging of waterways. In addition, clearing and grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. 
(b)  As a result, the purpose of the local regulations contained in this subdivision is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment, protect water quality and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other land disturbing activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth or land in the city and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of the City of Baytown. 
(Ord. No. 11,127, § 6, 6-11-09) 
Sec. 98-551. - Applicability.

This subdivision establishes minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within the city. This subdivision seeks to meet these purposes through the following objectives: 
(1)  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, silting, increases in stream temperature, and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels; 
(2)  Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
(3)  Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and 
(4)  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety.

Sec. 110-27. - Statutory authorization. 
    In V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.315, the state legislature has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, in response thereto, the city has adopted this article. 
(Code 1967, § 121/2-1; Ord. No. 4233, § 1, 8-22-85; Ord. No. 10,609, § 1, 5-22-07; Ord. No. 10,617, § 2, 6-7-07) 
Sec. 110-28. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 1967, § 121/2-2; Ord. No. 4233, § 1, 8-22-85) 
Sec. 110-29. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Code 1967, § 121/2-3; Ord. No. 4233, § 1, 8-22-85) 
Sec. 110-30. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in the times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1967, § 121/2-4; Ord. No. 4233, § 1, 8-22-85) 
Sec. 110-31. - Lands to which article applies.

Sec. 110-104. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 110-32 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following shall apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, and all components of the electrical and mechanical systems or any other service facility elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one foot higher than the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet) if no depth number is specified). Additionally, plumbing systems shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent floodwaters from entering or damaging them. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, and all components of the electrical, and mechanical systems or any other service facility elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one foot higher than the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet) if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads or effects of buoyancy. Additionally, plumbing systems shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent floodwaters from entering or damaging them. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in subsection 110-69(1)(a), are satisfied. 
(4)  Within zones AH and AO, there shall be required adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Code 1967, § 121/2-33; Ord. No. 4233, § 1, 8-22-85; Ord. No. 7831, § 10, 10-24-96; Ord. No. 9582, § 3, 6-26-03) 
Sec. 110-105. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 110-32 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, the city may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided the city first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Code 1967, § 121/2-34; Ord. No. 4233, § 1, 8-22-85; Ord. No. 4641, § 6, 2-12-87; Ord. No. 7831, § 11, 10-24-96; Ord. No. 12,823 , § 1, 4-9-15) 
Sec. 110-106. - Coastal high hazard areas. 
    Located within the special flood hazard areas established in section 110-32 are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (zone V1-30, VE and/or V). These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from tidal surges and hurricane wave wash; therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions outlined in this article, the following must also apply: 
(1)  Obtain the elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor, excluding pilings and columns, of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all such information; 
(2)  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide; 
(3)  All new construction, substantial improvements and any repetitive loss structure shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that: 
a.  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor, excluding the pilings or columns, is elevated 24 inches above the base flood level; and 
b.  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the requirements of subsections (3)a. and (3)b. of this section; 
(4)  Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood latticework or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For purpose of this subsection, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot, either by design or when so required by local or state codes, may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
a.  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
b.  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, structural and nonstructural. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards. Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation; 
(5)  The use of fill for structural support of buildings shall be prohibited; 
(6)  Manmade alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands which increase potential flood damage is prohibited; 
(7)  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved within zones V1-30, V and VE on the community's FIRM must meet the standards of subsections (1) through (6) of this section and subsection 110-102(4). 
(8)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones V1-30, V and VE on the community's FIRM must: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; and 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or a jacking system, if it is attached to the site only by quick disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and if it has no permanently attached additions. 
(9)  Appurtenant structures shall meet the standards of subsection (4) of this section. 
(10)  Solid (perimeter) foundations walls are not an acceptable means of elevating structures in V and VE zones

(b)  A credit or offset associated with a plat shall be applied against an impact fee due at the time that the first fee for the new development is collected, and thereafter to all subsequently collected fees, until the credit or offset is exhausted. 
(Ord. No. 9854, § 4, 8-26-04) 
Sec. 114-105. - Accounting.

Local Government Code. However, if the impact fee was paid by another political subdivision or governmental entity, payment shall be made to the political subdivision or governmental entity.

An impact fee shall also be considered expended if the total expenditure for facilities and improvements included in the capital improvements plan, as may be amended from time to time, within the service area within ten years following the date of payment, exceeds the impact fees collected within the service area during such period. 
(2)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsection (1), the city shall divide the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units for which impact fees have been paid within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the owner shall be calculated by: 
a.  Multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units of the development for which the fee was paid; and 
b.  Determining interest due based on the amount calculated under subsection a. above. 
(e)  The city shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to ensure that impact fees disbursed from the fund are utilized solely for the purposes authorized. The city shall maintain and keep financial records for impact fees, that shall show the source and disbursement of all fees collected in or expended.

    The chief building official shall be the sign administrator charged with administering and enforcing the terms and conditions of this chapter and all other provisions of laws relating to signs. The sign administrator is empowered to delegate the duties and powers granted to and imposed upon him by this chapter to other persons serving under the sign administrator. The sign administrator and such other persons shall constitute the sign administration section of the building inspections division. The sign administrator is directed to enforce and carry out all sections of this chapter and shall work under the direction and supervision of the city manager. 
(Code 1967, § 251/2-4(a); Ord. No. 3593, § 1, 4-14-83; Ord. No. 5472, § 2, 2-22-90) 
Sec. 118-62. - Enforcement responsibility. 
    The duties of the sign administrator shall include not only the issuance of permits as required by this chapter, but also the responsibility of ensuring that all signs comply with this chapter and any other applicable laws and that every sign for which a permit is required does in fact have a permit. The sign administrator shall make such inspections as may be necessary and shall initiate appropriate action to bring about compliance with this chapter and other applicable law if such inspection discloses any instance of noncompliance. The sign administrator shall investigate thoroughly any complaints of alleged violations of this chapter. 
(Code 1967, § 251/2-4(b); Ord. No. 3593, § 1, 4-14-83; Ord. No. 5472, § 2, 2-22-90)

(2)  Upon presentation of proper identification to the owner, agent or tenant in charge of such property, the sign administrator may enter, for the purpose of inspecting and investigating signs or sign structures, any building, structure, or other premises or property between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. However, in an emergency where extreme hazards are known to exist that may involve imminent injury to persons, loss of life or severe property damage and when the owner, agent or tenant in charge of the property is not available after the sign administrator has made a good faith effort to locate him, the sign administrator may enter such structures and premises at any time upon presentation of proper identification to any other person on the premises. Whenever the sign administrator shall enter upon private property, under any circumstances, for the purpose of inspecting or investigating signs or sign structures, which property has management in residence, such management or the person then in charge shall be notified of his presence and shown his proper and official credentials. The sign administrator, when on private property, shall observe the establishment's rules and regulations concerning safety, internal security and fire protection. Whenever the sign administrator is denied admission to inspect any premises, inspection shall be made only under authority of a warrant issued by a magistrate authorizing the inspection for violations of this chapter. In applying for such warrant, the sign administrator shall submit to the magistrate his affidavit setting forth his belief that a violation of this chapter exists with respect to the place sought to be inspected and his reasons for such belief. Such affidavit shall designate the location of such place and the name of the person believed to be the owner, operator or occupant thereof. If the magistrate finds that probable cause exists for a search of the premises in question, he shall issue a warrant authorizing the search, such warrant describing the premises with sufficient certainty to identify the premises. Any warrant so issued shall constitute authority for the sign administrator to enter upon and inspect the premises described therein. 
(3)  Upon notice and issuance of a stop order from the sign administrator, work on any sign that is being conducted shall be immediately stopped. Such notice and order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property or to his agent or to the person doing the work and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, written notice shall not be required to be given by the sign administrator. Following the issuance of a stop order, the sign administrator shall initiate proceedings to revoke any permit issued for the work covered by such stop order, consistent with subsection (4) of this section, unless the cause of the stop order is resolved to the sign administrator's satisfaction. It shall be unlawful for a person to intentionally or knowingly work upon a sign for which a written stop order is issued by the sign administrator. 
(4)  The sign administrator shall have the power and authority to revoke any and all permits authorized by this chapter for violation of the terms of this chapter, provided that the sign administrator shall conduct a hearing prior to the revocation of any permit authorized under this chapter to determine the facts incident to the pending revocation. The person whose permit is under consideration shall be given at least ten calendar days' written notice of the hearing and shall be permitted to present relevant facts and legal argument regarding the pending revocation. Following such hearing, the sign administrator shall consider the merits of the case and shall present a written opinion prior to any action. However, if in the opinion of the sign administrator the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the city is endangered by any violation of this chapter, the sign administrator may immediately revoke any or all permits authorized by this chapter and shall conduct the necessary hearing as soon as possible thereafter, but in no case later than three business days after the effective date of the revocation unless the affected permittee shall request in writing a later date.

DIVISION 3. - CONSTRUCTION AND STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 118-241. - Design. 
(a)  Generally. All signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind forces as specified in this division. All bracing systems shall be designed and constructed to transfer lateral forces to the foundations. For signs on buildings, the dead and lateral loads shall be transmitted through the structural frame of the building to the ground in such manner as not to overstress any of the elements thereof. The overturning movement produced from lateral forces shall in no case exceed two-thirds of the dead-load resisting moment for all signs. Uplift due to overturning shall be adequately resisted by proper anchorage to the ground or to the structural frame of the building for all signs. The weight of earth superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead-load resisting moment. Such earth shall be carefully placed and thoroughly compacted. The allowable stresses in wire ropes and steel guy rods and their fastenings shall not exceed one-fourth of their rated tensile strength. 
(b)  Wind loads. All signs and sign structures shall be designed to resist wind loads as follows:

(1)  There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved, such that the strict application of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land; 
(2)  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, welfare or will be injurious to other property in the area; and 
(3)  The granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly subdivision of other land in the area in accordance with this chapter. 
(b)  Such findings of the commission, together with the specified facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the commission meeting at which such variance is granted. Variances may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter so that the public health, safety and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 126-251. - Requirements for developments falling outside existing categories. 
    With the rapid changes that occur in development ideas and layouts, it is impossible to write regulations to cover every conceivable development. The commission, upon recommendation of the director of planning and development and the city engineer, is empowered to determine the specific requirements for each development that does not logically fall in an existing category. The commission may adjust the requirements for lot size, street construction, individual metering and sidewalks in developments that are proposed which do not fit existing categories. In approving developments under this section, the commission should determine that: 
(1)  The proposed use is appropriate and reasonable for the area; 
(2)  Approval will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; 
(3)  The effect of the development will not prevent orderly subdivision of other land in the vicinity; and 
(4)  The development will not cause the city to be required to provide city services at a level above that required in other subdivisions.

(c)  The location, elevation and construction of all utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets, shall be in such manner as to minimize or eliminate damage by flooding. 
(d)  Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce the community's exposure to flood hazards with respect to adjacent, upstream and downstream developments. 
(e)  No platted residential lot shall be approved that does not contain a suitable building site of sufficient elevation to permit construction utilizing the lowest floor elevation, including the basement, above the base flood level elevation.

If the corporation, community association or other legal entity responsible for maintaining the private streets fails to maintain reliable access as required to provide the city services, the city may enter the subdivision and remove any gate or device which constitutes a barrier to access at the sole expense of the corporation, community association or other legal entity responsible for maintaining the same. The corporation, community association or other legal entity responsible for maintaining the streets in need of repair shall be responsible for the costs associated with the removal of any and all gates from a private subdivision together with all maintenance expenses to bring the street in compliance with this division. Such costs must be paid within 30 days after receipt of a bill therefor. 
(c)  Location and specifications. All plans for installation of gates shall be approved by the chief building official and the chief of the fire department prior to any construction. Gates shall be set back at least 45 feet from any public way to allow fire apparatus to park completely off the street while gaining access. The minimum clear opening for any gate shall be equal to the minimum width of the fire lane or fire apparatus access road. The minimum clear opening must remain unobstructed at all times. A minimum centerline turning radius on either side of the gate shall be 35 feet. Gates shall be equipped with an automatic reversing system in the event the gate strikes an object while opening or closing. There shall be neither exposed gears nor overhead electrical wiring in any gate system. Electric gates shall be equipped with a single key, city-approved emergency access system designed to open and lock open both the entry and exit gates. The key switch shall be installed in a location approved by the fire department. In addition, a system key controlled "fail safe" mechanism shall be installed to allow the gate to be manually opened in the event of a power or mechanical failure. All fittings for system padlocks shall have a minimum one-half inch diameter hole. The city-approved control access system shall be operational and pass inspections of both the chief building official as well as the chief of the fire department before the gate may be placed in operation. Secondary emergency access gates shall be equipped with city-approved emergency access system padlocks and shall be unobstructed at all times. These gates shall be equipped with a positive mechanical latch to lock them in the open position. All fire lane widths, turning radiuses, set back and turnaround requirements of this Code will apply to the portion of the private street where the gate is installed.

    Large lots with wide frontage result in less drainage and traffic demands than single-family residential developments consisting of small lots with narrow frontages and widths. Therefore, the facility requirements and public impacts of the larger estate-type developments are less intensive. Such developments are desirable for the community to attract and encourage development and should not have to conform to the same standards that apply to the more intense developments. Residential developments undertaken pursuant to this division shall conform to this division and are considered exempt from conflicting provisions specified elsewhere in this chapter.

a.  The overall density remains at least one residential lot per acre; and 
b.  No residential lot within a large lot subdivision shall be less than 32,000 square feet. 
    As used in this subsection, the overall density shall be calculated by dividing the total acreage of all residential lots by the total number of lots. 
(b)  Setback requirements. Setbacks in the development shall be as follows: 
(1)  Front yard, 40 feet; 
(2)  Rear yard, 20 feet; and

Sec. 126-672. - Size. 
    In a subdivision, the sizing of inlets, storm sewers, outfalls, culverts and drainage ditches will be based on the following: 
(1)  Design storm. The design storm will be based on the rainfall intensity-frequency data used by the county flood control district. The interior drainage system will be designed for a storm with a frequency of occurrence of once in five years. The intensity of a 60-minute rainfall on this frequency is 2.80 inches. Major drainage ditches and structures will be designed for a storm with a frequency of occurrence of once in 25 years. The intensity of a 60-minute rainfall on this frequency is 3.75 inches. 
(2)  Runoff computation. To determine the runoff rates for various areas, the standard rational method will be used, utilizing the following formula: 
Q = CIA 
Where: 
Q = Rate of runoff in cubic feet per second C = Runoff coefficient I = Rainfall intensity for the particular duration in inches per hour A = Drainage area in acres  
Drainage areas will be computed by considering the location of high and low points on street grades, drainage divides in area and the general configuration of existing and finishing grades. Calculations for each major storm sewer line shall be shown on a drainage data sheet and shall be included in the proposed plans. All pertinent information (i.e., drainage areas, time of concentration, rainfall intensity, runoff coefficients, etc.) shall be listed on the data sheet. 
(3)  Sizing of storm sewers. Sewers shall be sized to carry the discharge (Q) derived from the formula in subsection (2) of this section. Capacity of storm sewers will be determined by the use of Mannings formula on the basis of hydraulic gradients rather than the physical slope of the pipe. 
(4)  Sizing and spacing of inlets. Inlets shall be spaced so that maximum travel distance of water in a gutter will not exceed 600 feet, unless otherwise approved at all low points in the gutter gradient. Inlets will be sized using an allowable capacity of one cubic foot per second per foot of opening for a throat height of five inches. Inlet design shall conform to standards on file with the city engineer.

(Ord. No. 12,473, § 11, 2-13-14) 
Sec. 1.27 - Nonconformities. 
(a)  Scope; continuation; repair and maintenance. 
(1)  Authority to continue. 
a.  Continuation of nonconforming use. A nonconforming use that lawfully occupied a structure or a vacant site on April 13, 2013, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the standards and limitations of this ULDC. 
b.  Continuation of noncomplying structure. A noncomplying structure that lawfully occupied a land site on April 13, 2013, that does not conform to the standards for front setbacks, side setbacks, rear setbacks, height, screening, floor area of structures, driveways or open space for the district in which the structure is located may be used and maintained, subject to the standards and limitations in this ULDC. 
(b)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Process for determining abandonment. Under this section, a nonconforming use of land or of a structure may be considered abandoned subject to the following: 
a.  Determination. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure that is discontinued or remains vacant for a continuous period of one year shall be presumed to be abandoned and shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the structure must conform to the structure regulations for the district in which it is located. 
b.  Overcoming presumption of abandonment. The presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon proof to the satisfaction of the director or to the board of adjustment that during such period the owner of the land or structure (i) is maintaining the property in accordance with the building code, (ii) is in compliance with article XV of chapter 18 of the Code of Ordinances pertaining to vacant buildings, and (iii) is either: 
i.  Actively and continuously marketed for sale or lease; or 
ii.  Engaged in other activities that would affirmatively prove there was not intent to abandon, such as obtaining a building permit and obtaining inspections meeting the requirements of the city's building code. 
c.  Calculation of period of abandonment. Any period of such discontinuance directly caused by government action, fire or natural calamity without any contributing fault by the owner of the property shall not be considered in the calculation of length of abandonment for this section. 
(2)  Movement, alteration and enlargement. No nonconforming use may be moved, enlarged or altered and no nonconforming use of land may occupy additional land, except as follows: 
a.  Enlargement. A nonconforming use may not be enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy all or a part of another structure or land site that it did not occupy on April 13, 2013. However, a nonconforming use may be extended within the same structure, provided no structural alteration of the structure is proposed or made for the purpose of the extension. 
b.  Exterior or interior remodeling or improvements to structure. Exterior or interior remodeling or improvements to a structure containing a nonconforming use shall be allowed, provided there is no expansion of the nonconforming use. 
c.  Relocation of structure. A structure containing a nonconforming use may not be moved unless the use shall conform to the regulations of the district into which the structure is moved. 
d.  Change of nonconforming nonresidential use to another nonconforming use. Upon application to the director pursuant to this article, a nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or similar type or intensity or to another nonconforming use of the same or similar type, but of less intensity. Whenever any nonconforming nonresidential use is changed to a less intensive nonconforming nonresidential use, such use shall not be changed back to a more intensive nonconforming nonresidential use. Whenever any nonconforming nonresidential use is changed to a conforming use, such use shall not later be changed to a nonconforming use. 
e.  Destruction of structure with nonconforming use. If a structure that contains a nonconforming use is destroyed to the extent of 50 percent or more by fire or natural calamity or is voluntarily razed or is required by law to be razed, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed except as provided in subsection (2)(f) of this section. The determination of the extent of damage or destruction under this subsection shall be determined in accordance with subsection (c)(7) of this section. 
f.  Special use permit. If a structure that contains a nonconforming use is destroyed to the extent of 50 percent or more by fire or natural calamity, the owner must file an application for a special use permit in accordance with section 1.26 if the owner desires to resume the nonconforming use. The application shall be processed in accordance with article one of this ULDC, except all of the following conditions must be met in lieu of those conditions found in section 1.26: 
i.  Not contrary to the public interest; 
ii.  Due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship; and 
iii.  The spirit of this ULDC is observed and substantial justice is done. 
(c)  Noncomplying structures. 
(1)  Generally. Under this ULDC, no noncomplying structure may be moved, enlarged or altered, except in the manner provided in this section or section (b) above or unless required by law. 
(2)  Applicability. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit improvements, maintenance or repair for any part of structures that are inside the existing footprint of a noncomplying structure that do not increase the height of the existing noncomplying structure. Some examples are the following: a water heater may be repaired or replaced within the existing footprint; components, cladding and roofs may be repaired as long as square footage (usable or not usable) is not added to make another story on the building or to exceed the existing footprint of the structure. 
(3)  Repair, maintenance, and alteration. Any noncomplying structure may be repaired, maintained, or altered; provided, however, that no such repair, maintenance, or alteration shall either create any new noncompliance or increase the degree of the existing noncompliance of all or any part of such structure except in the manner provided in this section or in the variance and special exception regulations of this ULDC. 
(4)  Enlargement. A noncomplying structure may not be enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy all or a part of the land site that it did not occupy on April 13, 2013, unless a noncomplying structure expansion variance is granted by the director or board of adjustment in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. 
(5)  Moving. A noncomplying structure shall not be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after being moved except in the manner provided in this section or in the variance and special exception regulations of this ULDC. 
(6)  Damage or partial destruction. If a noncomplying structure is damaged or destroyed by fire or natural calamity to the extent of 50 percent or less, the structure may be restored if restoration is started within six months and diligently pursued to completion. The city may require a cash deposit, bond or other guarantee of performance to ensure diligent progress and completion of the restoration. Any delay in starting such restoration that is caused by government action or natural calamities and without contributing fault by the owner shall be deducted in calculating the starting date of restoration. 
(7)  Destroyed structures. Reconstruction of a noncomplying structure that has been more than 50 percent destroyed may be granted by the board of adjustment only upon its finding that granting the variance satisfies the following conditions: 
a.  Not contrary to the public interest; 
b.  Due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship; and 
c.  The spirit of this ULDC is observed and substantial justice is done. 
It shall be the applicant's responsibility to demonstrate the basis for the variance request to the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment may impose such conditions as are necessary to protect adjacent property owners, to safeguard the character of the neighborhood in which the noncomplying structure is located, and to ensure the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, including, but not limited to, conditions specifying the period during which the nonconforming use may continue to operate or exist before being brought into conformance with the standards of the zoning regulations of this ULDC. In considering such reconstruction, the board of adjustment shall address the public welfare, character of the area surrounding such structure, the conservation, preservation and protection of property, including the applicant's property, as well as all plans adopted by the city council that affect or cover the area in which the land is located. 
(8)  Calculation for percentage destroyed. The board of adjustment shall utilize the following to make its determination concerning more than 50 percent destroyed: 
a.  The value of the noncomplying structure prior to destruction shall be established using the most current (pre-destruction) appraisal district tax roll; and 
b.  The owner may propose to substitute a current appraisal of the nonconforming building (before it was destroyed) prepared by an appraiser licensed in the state to prepare such appraisal. 
(d)  Variances for the expansion of noncompliant structures. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to set minimum requirements, standards and conditions for approving proposed variances to allow the expansion of noncomplying structures. These regulations are intended to ensure the same general level of compatibility as is set forth in the comprehensive plan, neighborhood plans, and redevelopment and economic development plans adopted by city council. These regulations intend that variances granted to nonconforming structures do not adversely affect the adjacent land uses, especially adjacent residential uses, or the physical character of uses or structures in the immediate vicinity of the neighborhood in which the variance is sought. Finally, the purpose of variances is to - over time - bring nonconforming structures into compliance with the current zoning regulations in order to improve neighborhoods, businesses and tax base. 
(2)  Types of expansion variances. 
a.  Variance by director. The director may grant a variance for a nonconforming structure affecting up to ten percent, not to exceed 5,000 square feet of the footprint of the nonconforming structure if the applicant elects to comply with the standards set forth in subsections (3) and (4) of this section. 
b.  Variance by the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment may grant a variance affecting the expansion of a nonconforming structure, if the applicant elects to comply with the standards set forth in subsections (3) and (4) of this section. The board of adjustment may grant a variance or variances that cumulatively with any variance or variances granted by the director allow up to a 40 percent expansion, but not to exceed 25,000 square feet of the nonconforming structure on April 13, 2013. Expansion variances may not be granted for 100 percent of the nonconforming structure. 
(3)  Expansion variance criteria. The director or the board of adjustment may grant an expansion variance when the applicant demonstrates that the variance request will meet all the criteria below: 
a.  Ensures the same general level of land use compatibility as the otherwise applicable standards; 
b.  Does not adversely affect adjacent land uses and the physical character of uses in the neighborhood in which the exception is sought because of inadequate buffering, screening, setbacks and other land use considerations; 
c.  Does not adversely affect property values of adjacent properties in any material way and will improve the property value of the property for which the exception is sought; 
d.  Furthers the goals and vision of the city as set forth in the comprehensive plan, the vision statement, and an applicable neighborhood plan or redevelopment plan adopted by the city council; 
e.  Does not decrease any building setback or further encroach into a building setback that is the basis of the structure's noncomplying status; 
f.  Is generally consistent with the purposes and intent of this ULDC; and 
g.  Will bring the existing and proposed structure closer into compliance with the zoning regulations of this ULDC, or will otherwise improve or enhance public health, safety or welfare. 
(4)  Variance credits. In addition to the variance criteria listed in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the applicant may be granted an expansion variance only when the applicant has supplied credits in the amounts shown in table 1-4 that illustrates the number of approved credits required for the applicant's proposed project based on the percentage expansion of the project. 
Table 1-4. Variance credits. 
Percent of Variance 
To be Granted Number of Approved 
Credits Required 10% or less 2 Over 10% to 20% 3 Over 20% to 30% 4 Over 30% to 40% 5  
a.  The variance credits proposed to be met herein for the board of adjustment or director shall not be the same standards already approved to support a variance granted on the same property. 
b.  Such credits may be approved by the board of adjustment or director as part of the application for variance and staff may deny any subsequent building permit if applicant fails to comply with the variance conditions set by the board of adjustment. 
c.  The applicant for a variance shall then choose any of the following credits that match the number of required credits for the project, subject to the approval of the director or the board of adjustment as applicable to the case: 
i.  Installation of a streetscape along the street at which the project is addressed following the standards that are set forth in section 18-1206 of the Code of Ordinances; 
ii.  Installation of parking lot landscaping to the percent of required landscaping that equals or exceeds the extent of the expansion requested in the variance based upon section 18-1205 of the Code of Ordinances; 
iii.  Installation of a public sidewalk along the frontage(s) of the property where no sidewalk exists; 
iv.  Installation of an improved buffer between the property and adjacent properties zoned or used for residential purposes, which may include the addition of hedges or decorative posts, or the substitution of higher quality materials for the buffer fence or other similar improvements; 
v.  Painting or otherwise modifying the exterior of the structure with appropriate building materials to match the color range and/or materials of adjacent properties and/or those immediately across the street. Modifications may include, but are not limited to, the addition of siding, awnings, window trim, and new facia. When the property in question is located in a neighborhood that has a plan adopted by the city council and that addresses architectural standards, then material/exterior must comply with the adopted plan before credit may be given under this section; 
vi.  Construction of a new roof on the structure such that the appearance and safety of the structure are improved; 
vii.  Specifying the period during which the nonconforming use or structure may continue to operate or exist before being brought into conformance with the standards of the zoning regulations; 
viii.  Maintenance of specific operating hours for a nonconforming use; or 
ix.  Alternative proposals that meet all the intent and purpose of this ULDC. 
(5)  Approval. The director or board of adjustment may approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the application for an expansion variance permit, pursuant to the criteria of this section. Any approval or conditional approval of a variance shall include the number and type of credits approved by the director or the board of adjustment for the variance consistent with this section.

Sec. 1.27.5 - Exclusion certificates for drilling, oil or gas operations. 
(a)  Exclusion determination. Drilling, oil or gas operations that have commenced before [the effective date of this section, Feb. 23, 2014] may be allowed to continue where an exclusion certificate has been issued by the director. In order to obtain such a certificate, the applicant shall provide the director: 
1.  A hazardous materials management plan meeting the requirements in chapter 62 of this Code. 
2.  A risk management plan meeting the requirements in chapter 62 of this Code; 
3.  A valid drilling permit for each well previously issued by the city in accordance with chapter 62 of this Code, or the information required in subsection 2.085(c)(3) of this article and sections 62-59 and 62-64 of the Code with the exception of subsections 62-59(10) and (11); and 
4.  Copies of all current state permits, and those in effect prior to [the effective date, Feb. 23, 2014], including state agency documentation establishing the date of initial and most recent operations of each well, tank, or other improvement. 
(b)  Application period. Application for an exclusion determination shall be made within 365 days of [effective date, Feb. 23, 2014], or the operations shall be considered abandoned, be considered a new project, and shall require compliance with all terms and conditions of this code. 
(c)  Decision of director. Exclusion determinations shall be based on the written materials submitted to the director, and the materials shall be reviewed and evaluated by the director and other staff as necessary. The director shall issue a determination letter after a review of the information submitted in subsection (a). Upon a determination of pre-existing drilling, oil or gas operation, an exclusion certificate shall be issued and the site where the pre-existing operation occurs shall be registered with a record of the evidence presented, the date of determination, and the scope of the exclusion. 
(d)  Effect of exclusion determination. The director's determination as to the pre-existing operations of any individual well shall only address issues of location for purposes of compliance with the ULDC. The director's determination cannot waive any requirements for upgrading of equipment or compliance with federal, state or national fire or safety codes. 
    Existing drilling, oil or gas operations shall be allowed to continue if an exclusion certificate has been issued accordance with subsection (c), provided, however, that any new well, tank, or appurtenance that has not previously been developed for drilling, oil or gas operations shall be considered a new project, and shall require either a special use permit if in an HI zoning district or the establishment of a DOD if within the Goose Creek Oil Field, and compliance with all terms and conditions of any new regulations. 
(Ord. No. 12,473, § 12, 2-13-14) 
Sec. 1.28 - Regulations pertaining to variances and special exceptions. 
(a)  Review and recommendation by director. After determining that the application for a variance or special exception permit is complete, the director shall review the application and prepare a staff report, which may include a recommendation of approval, approval with conditions or disapproval based upon the criteria in sections 1.29 and 1.30. A copy of the report shall be mailed to the applicant at least five days prior to the public hearing on the application. 
(b)  Conditions. The director may recommend and the board of adjustment may impose such conditions on a variance or special exception permit as are necessary to accomplish the purposes of this ULDC, to prevent or minimize adverse impacts upon the public and neighborhoods and to ensure compatibility. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, limitations on size, bulk and location; standards for landscaping, buffering and screening, lighting and adequate ingress and egress; cash deposits, bonds and other guarantees of deposit; other on-site improvements; and limitations on the duration of the permit or hours of operation. 
(c)  Submittal requirements. Any application for a variance or special exception shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale that accurately depicts the existing conditions and the proposed conditions, including lot lines, locations of all structures, driveways, fences, berms, buffer landscaping, signs and paved areas and other items or features that may be appropriate to the consideration of the variance or special exception being sought as requested by the director. An as-built survey may serve as the basis for the existing conditions shown on the site plan. 
(d)  Action by board of adjustment. After due notice, the board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing on an application for a variance permit. At the public hearing, the board of adjustment shall consider the application, the staff report, the relevant support materials and the public testimony given at the public hearing. After the close of the public hearing, the board of adjustment shall vote to approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the application for a variance permit, pursuant to the criteria of section 1.29. Any approval or conditional approval of a variance shall include the number and type of credits approved by the board of adjustment for the variance consistent with section 1.29. This subsection does not apply to variances granted by the director per subsection 1.29(e). 
(e)  Effect. 
(1)  Generally. Issuance of a variance or special exception permit shall authorize only the particular variation which is approved. A variance or special exception permit shall run with the land. 
(2)  Time limit. Unless otherwise specified in the variance or special exception permit, an application to commence construction of the improvements that are the subject of the variance or special exception must be applied for and approved within 12 months of the date of approval of the special exception or variance; otherwise the variance or special exception permit shall automatically become null and void. Permitted timeframes do not change with successive owners. Upon written request, only one extension of the 12-month timeframe may be granted by the board of adjustment for a period not to exceed 12 months for good cause shown. 
(3)  Null and void. Once the variance becomes null and void, owner shall remove any nonconforming structures or pieces of structures that were addressed by the variance granted. Any structures or improvements not associated with the variance granted are not required to be removed. 
(Ord. No. 11,866, § 2(Exh. A), 2-23-12) 
Sec. 1.29 - Variance process. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of a variance process is to consider and approve deviations from the property development and masonry standards for the applicable district where development is proposed that would not be contrary to the public interest and, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship and if granted the spirit of this chapter is observed and substantial justice done. A variance is not applicable to a use or an operational performance standard. 
(b)  Types of variances: 
(1)  Variance by board of adjustment. The board of adjustment and the director may grant a variance from the property development and masonry standards of zoning for a property if the variance satisfies criteria identified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  Variance by director. The director may consider and grant a variance of up to ten percent of the property development requirement when the applicant demonstrates that the variance request will meet all the criteria below: 
a.  Ensures the same general level of land use compatibility as the otherwise applicable standards; 
b.  Does not adversely affect adjacent land uses and the physical character of uses in the neighborhood in which the exception is sought because of inadequate buffering, screening, setbacks and other land use considerations; 
c.  Does not adversely affect property values of adjacent properties in any material way and will improve the property value of the property for which the exception is sought. (Did the applicant demonstrate that the structure has historically provided a facility in the neighborhood or otherwise improves the overall neighborhood); 
d.  Furthers the goals and vision of the city as set forth in the comprehensive plan, the vision statement, and an applicable neighborhood plan or redevelopment plan adopted by the city council; and 
e.  Is generally consistent with the purposes and intent of this ULDC. 
(c)  Variance criteria. The board of adjustment may grant a variance when the applicant demonstrates that the variance request will meet all the criteria below: 
(1)  Ensures the same general level of land use compatibility as the otherwise applicable standards; 
(2)  Is not a hardship of the applicant's own making; 
(3)  Does not adversely affect adjacent land uses and the physical character of uses in the neighborhood in which the exception is sought because of inadequate buffering, screening, setbacks and other land use considerations; 
(4)  Does not adversely affect property values of adjacent properties in any material way and will improve the property value of the property for which the exception is sought. (Did the applicant demonstrate that the structure has historically provided a facility in the neighborhood or otherwise improves the overall neighborhood); 
(5)  Furthers the goals and vision of the city as set forth in the comprehensive plan, the vision statement, and an applicable neighborhood plan or redevelopment plan adopted by the city council; 
(6)  Is generally consistent with the purposes and intent of this ULDC; 
(7)  Is needed as special circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or structure that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district and are not merely financial; 
(8)  Is necessary as literal interpretation and enforcement of the terms and provisions of the dimensional standards would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by landowners in the same district and would cause an unnecessary and undue hardship; 
(9)  Is the minimum action that will make possible the use of the land or structure which is not contrary to the public interest and which would carry out the spirit of this ULDC and would result in substantial justice; and 
(10)  Will bring the existing and proposed structure closer into compliance with the zoning regulations of this ULDC, or will otherwise improve or enhance public health, safety or welfare. 
(d)  Variance application standards. A complete application for a variance shall be submitted by a qualified applicant to the director on a form prescribed by the director, along with a nonrefundable fee to defray the actual cost of processing the application. No application shall be processed until the established fee has been paid and the application has been determined complete by the director. 
(e)  Action by director. The director may approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the application for a variance permit, pursuant to the criteria of this section.

Sec. 1.30 - Special exception process. 
(a)  Scope. Special exceptions are deviations from otherwise applicable operational performance standards and compatibility standards where development is proposed that would be: 
(1)  Compatible with surrounding land uses; 
(2)  In keeping with the public interest; and 
(3)  Consistent with the purposes of this ULDC. 
(b)  Permit criteria. To approve an application for a special exception permit, the director or board of adjustment shall make an affirmative finding that granting the special exception will: 
(1)  Ensure the same general level of land use compatibility as the otherwise applicable standards; 
(2)  Not materially and adversely affect adjacent land uses and the physical character of uses in the immediate vicinity of the proposed development because of inadequate buffering, screening, setbacks and other land use considerations; 
(3)  Not adversely affect property values in any material way; and 
(4)  Be generally consistent with the purposes and intent of this ULDC. 
(Ord. No. 11,866, § 2(Exh. A), 2-23-12) 
Sec. 1.31 - Development manual. 
(a)  A development manual that includes the following standards shall be prepared by the director and used in this development review process: 
(1)  Review schedules; 
(2)  Application forms for all development applications governed by this ULDC; and 
(3)  Checklists for all applications governed by this ULDC. 
(b)  The development manual shall be consistent with this ULDC and shall be implemented in a manner that is consistent with this ULDC.

(16)  Phasing schedule. A development larger than 100 acres shall provide a phasing schedule depicting the construction phases. 
(e)  Planning and zoning commission recommendation of detail plan and planned unit development. The planning and zoning commission shall review and make recommendations on a detail plan and PUD to the city council. The planning and zoning commission shall make a recommendation to approve if it finds that the detail plan and PUD satisfies the criteria specified in section 1.26(c), except for section 1.26(c)(5). 
(f)  Approval of detail plan and planned unit development. The city council may, after receiving a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission, approve by ordinance a detail plan and the creation of a PUD based upon a detail plan. The detail plan shall be made part of the ordinance establishing the PUD. Upon approval said change shall be indicated on the zoning maps of the city. The development standards and requirements delineated in the detail plan for uses proposed shall be established based upon the particular merits of the development design and layout. Such standards and requirements shall be more or less restrictive than the standards established in the base zoning district for the specific type uses allowed in the district. Modifications in these regulations may be granted by the council if it shall be found that such modifications are in the public interest, are in harmony with the purposes of this ULDC and will not adversely affect nearby properties. 
(g)  Expiration of detail plan. A detail plan shall be valid for two years from the date of its approval. If a building permit has not been issued within the two years, the detail plan shall automatically expire and no longer be valid. The council may, prior to expiration of the detail plan, for good cause shown, extend for up to 12 months the time for which the detail plan is valid. If the detail plan is part of a PUD, the zoning designation and development standards revert to the underlying zoning district and all future phases are also expired. 
(h)  Review of progress; termination of detail plan. Annually, on or about the time of the original city council approval, the planning and zoning commission may review progress on the development. If measurable progress cannot be demonstrated by the developer of the detail plan, then the planning and zoning commission may recommend to the city council to void the detail plan. If the detail plan is part of a PUD and found to be void, the PUD and the remaining phases of the PUD are also void. 
(i)  Changes in detail plan. Changes in the detail plan shall be considered the same as a zoning map amendment and follow sections 2.08(e) and (f) for approval and shall be processed in accordance with this ULDC. Those changes which do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property and which do not alter the uses permitted or increase the density, floor area ratio, height, or coverage of the site, or which do not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the landscape provided at the boundary of the site, as indicated on the approved detail plan, may be authorized by the director. Any applicant may appeal the decision of the director to the planning and zoning commission for review and decision as to whether an amendment to the detail plan or planned unit development district shall be required. 
(j)  Deviation from code standards. The city council may approve a PUD or detail plan with deviations from any provision in this ULDC. Such deviations shall be listed or shown as part of the ordinance that approves the detail plan or PUD. The focus shall be on the provision of private open space, trails and connections to the public trail system, higher standards for site design, and the provision of other amenities such as community buildings, preservation of view corridors, for example.

Sec. 2.082. - San Jacinto overlay district. 
(a)  Purpose. The San Jacinto overlay district is designed to: 
(1)  Promote the health and well-being of residents by encouraging pedestrian modes and greater social interaction; 
(2)  Promote an aesthetically significant, high density, mixed-use area, which encourages pedestrian activity, promotes services, and enhances the aesthetic value of an area; 
(3)  Permit a combination of office, retail, commercial, and residential uses within a single development, with the non-residential uses on the ground floor and residential units on the upper floors; and 
(4)  Minimize the impact of uses that have a higher intensity. 
(b)  Applicability. This section applies to all non-residentially zoned property. The San Jacinto overlay district is to be combined with only non-residential base zoning districts. The adoption of this overlay district should not be construed as a change in zoning. 
    The overlay district is divided into three tiers. Each tier may have different zoning regulations. Each tier is designated in Figure SJ0-1 and shall govern the property in the tier. If any portion of a lot or tract falls within more than one tier, the entire property must be developed using the standards that apply to the lowest numbered tier. 
 Tier 1 (T1) includes any lot that is within a 700-foot radius from the centerline of the right-of-way at the intersection of (i) San Jacinto Boulevard and Hunt Road, as well as, (ii) San Jacinto Boulevard and Lone Star Street; and any lot that is within a 500-foot radius from the centerline of the right-of-way at the intersection of San Jacinto Boulevard and Santavy Street. Tier 1 is intended to govern the key intersections throughout this overlay district. Tier 1 is intended to produce an urban aesthetic with closely developed buildings, taller buildings, and hidden parking. 
 Tier 2 (T2) includes parcels outside of the Tier 1 boundary that are 700 feet from the centerline of the San Jacinto Boulevard and Hunt Road rights-of-way. Tier 2 is intended to incentivize the aforementioned corridors to achieve a compatible development with T1, however, it doesn't emphasize the urban density as much. 
 Tier 3 (T3) would include all other properties within the overlay district that are not determined to be within Tier 1 or Tier 2. Tier 3 is intended to permit a less dense and less urban profile, while maintaining compatibility with the other tiers.
