PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Herndon, Virginia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, as supplemented through October 13, 1998, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Richard B. Kaufman, Town Attorney, Viki L. Wellershaus, Town Clerk, William D. Welford, Supervisor of Revenue/Purchasing, John E. Moore, Director of Public Works, Henry G. Bibber, Director of Community Development, and Chris Jaeschke, Senior Civil Engineer, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

    Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance which is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished as follows: 
(a)  Whenever in the Code, or in any ordinance of the town or rule or regulation promulgated by an officer, board, commission or agency of the town under authority vested by law or ordinance, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or the doing of any act is required, or the failure to do any act is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, the violation of any such provision of this Code, ordinance, rule or regulation shall be punished as follows, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section: 
(1)  Whenever an act or offense, or the failure to do any act is declared to be a Class 1 misdemeanor, such act or offense shall be punished by a fine of not more than $2,500.00 or confinement in jail for not more than 12 months, or both such fine and imprisonment.

Acts or offenses, or failure to do any act, defined by the various provisions of this Code, for which punishment is prescribed without specification as to the class of the offense, act or failure to act, shall be punished according to the provisions prescribing the punishment; but such penalty shall not exceed the penalty prescribed by state law for the same offense. 
(c)  Except where otherwise provided, each day any violation of this Code, or of any such ordinance, rule or regulation shall continue, shall constitute a separate offense. 
Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the town may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, administrative adjudication and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section 5. Additions and amendments to the Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the town council to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

Sec. 2-2. - Freedom of Information Act requests. 
(a)  The town supports good faith, timely, and responsive compliance to citizens' request for public records under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (Code of Virginia, § 2.2-3700, and following) (the Act). 
(b)  This policy effectuates the Act. Nothing in this section varies or legally may vary the Act. In case of a conflict, the Act prevails. 
(c)  Citizens are requested to reduce to writing their formal requests for copies of or access to public records so that the requested records are identified with reasonable specificity. The town will respond to written or non-written requests for copies of or access to public records under the Act. 
(d)  The Herndon Police Public Information Officer (HPD PIO) is hereby designated as the town's FOIA officer for Town of Herndon Police records. The chief communications officer (CCO) is hereby designated as the Town's FOIA officer for all other requests for public records. 
(e)  Citizens should direct formal requests for copies of or access to public records to the appropriate FOIA officer. The FOIA officer will coordinate and manage responses to formal requests for copying of or access to public records under the Act. 
(f)  The FOIA officer shall in written communication that meets the Act provide or render available non-exempt public records within five working days after the receipt of the request pursuant to the provisions of the Act. 
(g)  The town shall charge for the actual town reproduction costs of public records provided to and at the formal request of the citizen. The town manager shall establish in writing, document in a public filing, publicize, and periodically adjust based on prevailing reasonable rates the town's reproduction costs. 
(h)  The town shall charge the citizen a reasonable charge to cover town's actual personnel cost to access, search for, duplicate, and supply records subject to a formal request. The staff time for these services shall be the hourly rate of the employee, excluding fringe benefits. The town will not charge for time spent in supervision of the citizen's inspection and copying of the public records or for their preservation and safe keeping. 
(i)  The citizen requesting in a formal request copies of or access to public records may ask for an advance estimate of the town's costs for complying with the formal request for records. If the costs are likely to exceed $200.00, the town will require the citizen to pay the estimated costs in advance before the town must provide access to or copies of the records subject to a formal request. If the town provided this advance cost estimate, the statutory period for response stops running until the citizen pays the estimate. The town and the citizen must make an equitable adjustment of such costs upon the provision of the public records. 
(j)  Where the request for public records is legally complex or raises legal questions, the town may charge the town attorney's hourly rate less fringe benefits for support of the handling of the formal request for copies of or access to public records. 
(k)  Nothing in this section shall preclude the town manager, town attorney, or their respective staffs from informally responding to citizens without charge for reproduction or staff time to simple, day-to-day, or routine requests for access to or copies of readily available, concise, and discrete public information. Such requests are "informal requests" under the Act. All other requests under the Act are "formal requests." In case of doubt, the town manager may determine whether a request is a formal request or an informal request. The town manager's decision is final.

However, the public body by resolution may vote to disapprove such member's participation, as set out in the next sentence. If a member's participation from a remote location is disapproved because such participation would violate the policy set out in this section, such disapproval shall be recorded in the minutes with specificity. Such participation by the member shall be limited each calendar year to two meetings or 25 percent of the meetings of the public body, whichever is fewer. 
(c)  A member of a public body notifies the chair of the public body that such member is unable to attend a meeting due to a temporary or permanent disability or other medical condition that prevents the member's physical attendance and the public body records this fact and the remote location from which the member participated in its minutes. 
(d)  In either of the above cases, a quorum of the public body is physically assembled at the primary or central meeting location. 
(e)  In either of the above cases, the public body makes arrangements for the voice of the remote participant to be heard by all persons at the primary or central meeting location. 
(f)  The provisions of this section shall be applied strictly and uniformly without exception, to the entire membership body and without regard to the identity of the member requesting remote participation or to the matters that will be considered or voted on at the meeting.

(a)  In those circumstances provided for in this chapter wherein the town shall have the right to purchase ownership of a grantee's cable television system or any of its assets located within the town, the town may give notice that it elects to exercise such right and the town may acquire such assets, at the option of the town, at one of the following times: 
(1)  At the time of giving notice of election of its right to purchase (in which case the assets shall automatically transfer to the town); 
(2)  At any time specified by the town subsequent to the giving of notice of its election of its right to purchase (in which case the assets shall automatically transfer to the town at such subsequent time); or 
(3)  At the time of payment of the fair market value thereof. 
Unless the notice of election by the town specifically exercises a right described in subsections (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, subsection (a)(3) of this section shall apply. In those circumstances where subsection (a)(3) of this section applies, and the question of fair market value has been submitted to arbitration, the town may affirmatively accept the award of the arbitrators within 90 days after the rendering of the arbitrators' decision, at which time the assets shall automatically transfer to the town. However, if the town fails to accept the arbitrators' decision within such 90-day period, the rights of the town to purchase shall expire. 
(b)  In those circumstances provided for in this chapter wherein the town shall have the right to purchase ownership of a grantee's cable television system, or any of its assets located within the town, no question of fair market value shall be submitted to arbitration until 120 days have lapsed from the giving of such notice. Thereafter, either a grantee or the town may submit the matter to arbitration. 
(c)  If any time lapses between the time of transfer of assets and the time of payment therefor, the grantee shall be entitled to interest during the interim at the rate of eight percent per annum. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-13) 
Sec. 18-99. - Town's right to assign. 
    A franchise shall not limit the right of the town to assign its rights to acquire any or all of the assets of a grantee's cable television system located within the town. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-14) 
Sec. 18-100. - Grantee's obligation as trustee. 
(a)  At all times from the expiration or revocation of a franchise and until either a grantee transfers to the town or other succeeding operator of the system all of its rights, title and interest to all assets, real and personal, related to its cable television system in the town, or the town's right to either acquire or assign its rights to acquire any of the grantee's assets expires without the town having exercised such a right, whichever occurs first, the grantee shall have a duty to such successor as a trustee holding such assets for the benefit of such successor. The grantee shall not sell any of the system assets, nor shall the grantee make any physical, material or administrative operational changes that would tend to degrade the quality of service to the subscribers, decrease gross revenues, or materially increase expenses without the expressed permission, in writing, of the town or its assigns. The grantee shall at all times operate the system in accordance with terms of this chapter and the terms of the franchise as if the franchise had not expired or had not been revoked. 
(b)  In the event of expiration or revocation of a franchise, this section shall not be construed to give a grantee any vested or other franchise right, but the right of the grantee in such circumstances shall exist only on a day-to-day basis until the transfer is effected. 
(c)  For its management services during this interim period as a trustee, the grantee shall be entitled to receive as compensation the net profit generated during the period between the expiration or revocation of the franchiser, as the case may be, and the transfer of the grantee's assets to the town or a successor. 
(d)  Further, this section shall in no way limit the power of the town, upon expiration or revocation of a franchise, to require the grantee to cease all operations whatsoever and/or remove its facilities, or otherwise exercise any rights the town would otherwise have. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-15) 
Sec. 18-101. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  A grantee, in consideration of the privilege granted under a franchise for the operation of a cable television system located within the town, shall build a cable television system in accordance with the terms of its franchise and shall pay to the town a percentage of its annual gross revenues received in the town during the period of its operation under the franchise. The percentage to be paid shall be the lesser of either five percent of its annual gross revenues, or the maximum amount permitted under applicable federal or state law. A grantee shall, at all times, have the duty to forthwith take all steps, and do all things that may be necessary and/or proper to relieve itself and the town from any limitations which may exist under law including, but not limited to, applying for waivers of franchise fee limitations, etc. 
(b)  A grantee shall file with the town, within 30 days after the expiration of each of the grantee's fiscal quarters, a financial statement clearly showing the gross revenues received by the grantee for services within the town during the preceding quarter. Payment of the quarterly portion of the franchise fee shall be made to the town within the above-mentioned 30 days, at or before the time such financial statement is filed. A grantee shall also file, within 120 days following the conclusion of the grantee's fiscal year, the grantee's financial statements for that year, examined and reported on by an independent public accountant, certified in the commonwealth. The cost of such audit shall be borne by the grantee. 
(c)  The town shall have the right, consistent with the provisions of section 18-127(b), to inspect a grantee's income records, the right of audit and the right to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter. Any additional amounts due the town, as indicated by the audit, plus interest as specified in subsection (d) of this section, shall be paid to the town forthwith. 
(d)  If any franchise payment is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged from such due date at an annual rate of eight percent. If any franchise payments totaling $5,000.00 or more is not paid by the due date, then interest shall accrue to the town at a rate equal to the interest rate then chargeable for unpaid federal income taxes (26 USC 6221). In addition to the foregoing, the failure of the grantee to make a timely payment (as defined by Code of Virginia, § 6.1-330.26) of any amount shall subject the grantee to an additional late charge of five per centum of the amount of such payment. 
(e)  If a franchise is revoked prior to its expiration date, the grantee shall file with the town, within 30 days of the date of revocation, a financial statement clearly showing the gross revenues received by the grantee for services within the town since the end of the previous fiscal quarter, and shall pay within that time the franchise fees accrued as of the date of revocation.

(Code 1992, § 9.5-17) 
Sec. 18-103. - Transfer of franchise. 
(a)  The franchise granted under this chapter shall be a privilege to be held in personal trust by the grantee. It shall not be assigned, transferred, sold or disposed of, in whole or in part, by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise or by forced or involuntary sale, without prior consent of the town expressed by chapter and then on only such conditions as may therein be prescribed. The town is hereby empowered to take legal or equitable action to set aside, annul, revoke or cancel the franchise, or the transfer of the franchise, if such transfer is not made according to the procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(b)  Any sale, transfer or assignment of a franchise shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter and shall be made in writing, an executed copy of which shall be filed with the cable television administrator within 30 days after any such sale, transfer or assignment. The town shall not withhold its consent unreasonably; provided, however, that the proposed assignee must agree to comply with all the provisions of this chapter, the franchise, and reasonable amendments thereto, and must be able to provide proof of financial and character qualifications as determined by the council; provided further, however, that failure of the grantee to have constructed at least 25 percent of the system may be a reason to refuse consent for the transfer of the franchise. 
(c)  No such consent shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness except when such hypothecation shall exceed 75 percent of the fair market value of the property used by the grantee in the operation of its cable television system and except where the funds from the indebtedness are to be used for purposes other than the construction of the cable television system required to be provided by the franchise granted under the terms of this chapter. Prior consent of the council, expressed by resolution, shall be required for such transfer, and such consent shall not be withheld unreasonably. This subsection (c) shall not apply to a transfer resulting from a foreclosure or default in the conditions of such indebtedness. 
(d)  Prior approval of the council shall be required where ownership or control of 50 percent or more of the right to control of the grantee is acquired in any transaction or series of transactions by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own or control 50 percent or more of such right of control, singularly or collectively. By its acceptance of a franchise, a grantee shall specifically grant and agree that any such acquisition occurring without prior approval of the council shall constitute a violation of the franchise by the grantee. 
(e)  The consent of the council to any sale, transfer, lease, trust, mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation shall not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the town under this chapter and the franchise.

DIVISION 3. - RATE REGULATION, STANDARDS AND RECORDS 

Sec. 18-121. - Initial review of basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. Upon the adoption of this chapter and the certification of the town by the FCC, the town shall join in the joint notification to all cable operators in the town, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the joint certifiers intend to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992. 
(b)  Cable operator response. Within 30 days of receiving notice from the town, a cable operator shall file with the joint certifiers its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates. 
(c)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the cable television administrator is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark, the town council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic rates with the town. 
(2)  If the town council takes no action within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the town, the proposed rates will continue in effect. 
(d)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the cable television administrator is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the cable television administrator shall, within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the town and by written notice to the cable operator, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety days if the cable television administrator needs more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or 
b.  One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark. 
(2)  If the cable television administrator has not made a decision within the 90-day or 150-day period, the cable television administrator shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the proposed rate, the town council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. The town may elect to hold a joint hearing with the county. 
(f)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed initial basic rate may attend and speak at the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing prior to the end of the public hearing. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the cable television administrator shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the cable television administrator's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The cable television administrator will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The town council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates, minus ten percent, will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the town council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following: 
a.  If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the town council shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or 
b.  If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the town council shall establish initial basic cable rates in accordance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the cable television administrator determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the town council may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsections (g) or (h) of this section, as applicable. In addition, the town council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), for a period of up to one year, or retroactive to September 1, 1993, whichever is shorter. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the town council's decision resolution. 
(3)  Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. The resolution disapproving or approving, in whole or in part, the rates proposed by a cable operator shall state the reasons for the decision. 
(j)  Appeal. The town council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with the applicable federal regulations. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-19) 
Sec. 18-122. - Review of request for increase in basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. A cable operator in the town who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment, except as provided in section 18-124, shall file a request with the town and notify all subscribers at least 60 days before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than permitted by the FCC's regulations. 
(b)  Expedited determination and public hearing. If the cable television administrator is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the town council shall: 
(1)  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
(2)  Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the town. 
(c)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the cable television administrator is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the town council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety days if the cable television administrator needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and 
b.  One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap. 
(2)  The proposed rate increase is tolled during the foregoing periods. 
(3)  If the town council has not made a decision within the 90-day or 150-day period, the town council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(d)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the requested rate increase, the town council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(e)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed rate increase may attend and speak at the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing prior to the end of the public hearing. 
(f)  Delayed determination. If the town council is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the town council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the cable television administrator shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the cable television administrator's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the town council shall approve the proposed rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the town council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the cable television administrator will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The town council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The town council's decision concerning the requested rate increase, shall be adopted by formal resolution.

b.  The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of the extended review period; and 
c.  The cable television administrator determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the town council disapproves any portion of the rate increase. 
(2)  The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as stated in the town council's resolution. 
(k)  Appeal. The town council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-20) 
Sec. 18-123. - Cable operator information. 
(a)  Town may require. 
(1)  In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the cable television administrator may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the cable television administrator may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting information to the cable television administrator may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection, shall not be considered. 
(c)  Town council action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, will be acted upon by the town council. The town council will grant the request if the cable operator presents, by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the town council denies the request, the town council shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the cable television administrator, the cable operator may request that the cable television administrator return the information without considering it. The cable television administrator will comply with this request unless there is a finding that disclosure of the information is within the public's best interest. If this finding is made, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the cable television administrator, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(d)  Appeal. If the cable television administrator denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the town council within five working days of the cable television administrator's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review. The town council will consider the review at its next scheduled public hearing. If the town council denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days of the town council's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-21) 
Sec. 18-124. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the town and the cable television administrator at least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The cable television administrator shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the town makes no objection within 30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect without public notice or hearing. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-22) 
Sec. 18-125. - Refunds. 
    The town may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following circumstances: 
(1)  A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or 
(2)  The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued by the town. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-23) 
Sec. 18-126. - Standards. 
    In addition to those standards enacted under the Cable Act of 1992, incorporated in this chapter, the town requires the following service standards. In the event of a conflict between the town standards and those enacted pursuant to the Cable Act of 1992, the more stringent standard shall govern. 
(1)  A grantee shall notify in writing each subscriber of all applicable fees and charges for providing cable television service prior to executing a contract of service with such subscriber or installing any equipment to service such subscriber. 
(2)  A grantee may, for promotional purpose, at its own discretion, waive, reduce or suspend connection fees for specific or indeterminate periods and/or monthly service fee for a reasonable period. 
(3)  Except as may be otherwise provided in a franchise, a subscriber shall have the right to have cable television service terminated without charge. A subscriber shall not be charged for cable television service for more than two business days following the subscriber's notice of termination to the grantee. No grantee shall enter into any agreement with a subscriber which imposes any charge following disconnection of service, except for reconnection and subsequent monthly or periodic charges, and those charges shall be no greater than charges for new customers.

(b)  Applications for a franchise may include proposals for the provision of public, education, local government, and leased access channels. Such proposals by a grantee may be incorporated into the franchise granted and, to the extent so incorporated, shall subject the grantee to the following minimum requirements: 
(1)  The grantee shall have available equipment for local production and presentation of cablecast programs other than automated services and permit its use for the production and presentation of public access programs. The grantee shall not enter into any contract, arrangement or lease for use of its cablecast equipment which prevents or inhibits the use of such equipment for a substantial portion of time for public access programming. 
(2)  The grantee shall have no control over the content of access cablecast programs; however, this limitation shall not prevent taking appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the operating rules described in this section. 
(3)  The public access channels shall be made available on a nondiscriminatory basis, free of charge. Charges for equipment, personnel and production of public access programming shall be reasonable and consistent with the goal of affording users a low cost means of television access. A grantee shall provide without charge such production facilities and personnel to enable users of the public access channels to reasonably produce television programs not exceeding 15 minutes duration. A grantee shall, without charge, also provide the replay of users' supplied video tapes on the public access channel, provided that such tapes do not exceed 15 minutes duration. The grantee may require that such tapes are in a standard format compatible with the grantee's playback facilities. The grantee shall adopt operating rules for the public access channels, to be filed with the cable television administrator prior to the activation of the channels, designed to prohibit the presentation of: any advertising material designed to promote the sale of commercial products or services (including advertising by or on behalf of candidates for public office); lottery information; and obscene or indecent matter, as well as rules requiring nondiscriminatory access, and rules permitting public inspection of a complete record of the names and addresses of all persons or groups requesting access time.

Such a record shall be retained for a period of two years. 
(5)  The local government access channels shall be made available for the use of local government authorities free of charge. 
(6)  The leased access channels shall be made available to leased users. Priority shall be given part-time users on at least one channel. The grantee shall adopt operating rules for the channels, to be filed with the cable television administrator prior to activation of the channels, designed to prohibit the presentation of: lottery information, obscene or indecent matter and shall establish rules to this effect; and other rules requiring nondiscriminatory access, sponsorship identification, specifying an appropriate rate schedule and permitting public inspection of a complete record of the names and addresses of all persons or groups requesting time. Such a record shall be retained for a period of two years. 
(c)  A grantee shall provide, without charge within the town, one service outlet activated for regular subscriber service to each fire station, public school, police station, public library, and such other buildings used for public purposes as may be designated by the town or the county. However, if it is necessary to extend a grantee's trunk or feeder lines more than 300 feet solely to provide service to any such school or public building, the town or the county shall have the option either of paying the grantee's direct costs for such extension in excess of 300 feet, or constructing such extension in excess of 300 feet itself, or of releasing the grantee from or postponing the grantee's obligation to provide service to such building. Furthermore, a grantee shall be permitted to recover, from any public building owner entitled to free service, the grantee's actual cost for any additional converters required and the direct cost of installing, when requested to do so, more than one outlet, or concealed inside wiring, or a service outlet requiring more than 250 feet of drop cable; provided, however, that the grantee shall not charge for the provision of regular subscriber service to the additional service outlets so installed in public schools, police stations, fire stations, public libraries, and county or town offices in addition to any such other facilities as are specified in the grantee's franchise. The grantee shall provide full operational capability to the service outlets in the town in accordance with the construction schedule mandated by section 18-149(b) or in accordance with the construction schedule submitted with the grantee's proposal, whichever is earlier. 
(d)  The system shall be designed so that no more than two percent of the occupied dwelling units within the town shall be more than nine air miles from a head-end or distribution hub. 
(e)  A grantee shall not refuse cable television service to any person or organization who requests such service for lawful purposes. 
(f)  A grantee shall not permit the transmission of any programming under its control that is obscene or indecent. At the option of the subscriber, the grantee shall provide at cost, a device capable of blocking out or otherwise disabling a television set from receiving those channels upon which the grantee imposes a charge based upon a per-program basis or a per-channel basis. This device shall be designed to permit a subscriber, by the use of a key or similar locking system, to prevent others, who do not have a key, from viewing or receiving the programs on the aforementioned channels.

Such tests shall be performed by, or under the supervision of, a registered professional engineer or an engineer with proper training and experience. A report of such tests shall be submitted to the town, describing test results, instrumentation, calibration and test procedures, and the qualifications of the engineer responsible for the tests. 
(b)  System monitor test points shall be established at or near the output of the last amplifier in the longest feeder line, at or near trunk line extremities, and at locations to be specified in the franchise. Such periodic tests shall be made at the test points as shall be described by the cable television administrator. 
(c)  At any time after commencement of service to subscribers, the town may require additional reasonable tests, including full or partial repeat tests, different test procedures, or tests involving a specific subscriber's terminal, at the grantee's expense to the extent such tests may be performed by the grantee's employees utilizing its existing facilities and equipment; provided, however, that the town reserves the right to conduct its own tests upon reasonable notice to the grantee and if noncompliance is found, the expense thereof shall be borne by the grantee. The town will endeavor to arrange its request for such special tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to a grantee or to subscribers. 
(d)  The town shall have the same rights as the Federal Communications Commission has to inspect a grantee's performance test data. 
(e)  The town shall have the right to employ qualified consultants if necessary or desirable to assist in the administration of this section, or any other section of this chapter. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-31) 
Sec. 18-147. - Service, adjustment and complaint procedure.

(b)  A grantee shall maintain a listed local telephone number which shall be available to subscribers for service calls, 24 hours per day. Corrective action shall be initiated by a grantee not later than the next business day after a service call is received, and corrective action shall be completed as promptly as practicable. Appropriate records shall be made of service calls, showing when and what corrective action was completed. Such records shall be available to the town during normal business hours and retained in grantee's files for not less than three years. Microfilm copies of such records shall satisfy the requirements of this section.

Sec. 18-148. - Street occupancy. 
(a)  A grantee shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities whenever possible, and shall not construct or install any new, different or additional poles, conduits or other facilities whether on public property or on privately owned property until approval of the property owner or appropriate governmental authority is obtained. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of a grantee shall be a vested interest and such poles, structures or facilities shall be removed, replaced or modified by a grantee at its own expense whenever the council or other governmental authority determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
(b)  Where the town, other unit of government, or a public utility serving the town desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of a grantee, but agreement therefor with the grantee cannot be reached, the council may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the council shall determine to be just and reasonable, if the council determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee's operations. 
(c)  Unless otherwise regulated, all transmission lines, equipment and structures shall be so installed and located as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of owners of property which adjoins or abuts a street, way or other property upon which a grantee has placed its facilities, and at all times such facilities shall be kept and maintained in a safe, adequate and substantial condition, and in good order and repair. A grantee shall at all times employ at least reasonable care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries or nuisances to the public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other devices shall be used at such times and places as are reasonably required for the safety of all members of the public. Any poles or other fixtures placed in any public way by a grantee shall be placed in such a manner as not to interfere with the usual travel on such public way. 
(d)  In those areas of the town where electric and telephone utility lines have been placed underground, a grantee shall place its lines and installations underground. In areas where either telephone or electric utility facilities are aboveground at the time of installation, the grantee may install its service aboveground, provided that at such time as both of those facilities are placed underground, the grantee shall forthwith place its facilities underground, and the cost of the same shall be paid by the grantee, and no special charge shall be imposed upon any subscriber for such placing of facilities underground. 
(e)  In the event of disturbance of any road or private property by a grantee, it shall, at its own expense and in a manner approved by the town, other appropriate governmental authority or the owner, as the case may be, replace and restore such road or private property in as good a condition as before the work causing such disturbance was done. If the grantee fails to perform such replacement or restoration, the town, other governmental authority, or the owner shall have the right to do so at the sole expense of the grantee. Payment to the town, governmental authority, or owner for such replacement or restoration shall be upon demand. 
(f)  At the request of any person holding a valid building moving permit issued by the town or any other governmental authority, if such a permit is required, and upon at least 48 hours' notice, a grantee shall temporarily raise, lower or cut its wires as may be necessary to facilitate such move. The direct expense of such temporary changes, including standby time, shall be paid by the permit holder, and a grantee shall have the authority to require payment in advance. 
(g)  A grantee shall have the authority to trim trees on public property at its own expense as may be necessary to protect its wires and facilities, subject to the regulation, supervision and/or direction of the town or other local government authority. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-33) 
Sec. 18-149. - Construction schedule and reports. 
(a)  Upon accepting the franchise, a grantee shall, within 60 days, apply or otherwise file the documents required to obtain all necessary federal, state and local licenses, permits and authorizations required for the conduct of its business, and the construction and installation of its facilities, and it shall submit monthly reports to the cable television administrator on progress in this respect until all such licenses, permits and authorizations are secured. 
(b)  A grantee shall commence construction of the cable system within one year after acceptance of a franchise, and it shall complete construction of the system and offer and be capable of delivering cable television service in full accordance with this chapter and the franchise granted under this chapter to all subscribers and all public service outlets in the town described in section 18-144(c) within 36 months after commencing construction. For the purposes of this section, construction shall be deemed to have commenced when the first aerial strand cable has been attached to a pole, or the first underground trench has been opened. The failure of a grantee to secure the necessary federal, state and local licenses, permits and authorizations required for the conduct of its business shall, in no way, relieve the grantee from the obligations of this section and the failure to observe the construction schedule shall in addition to the other rights of the town be grounds for the town to terminate or revoke the franchise. 
(c)  Franchise applications shall include a timetable showing the percentage of occupied dwelling units within the town that will be capable of receiving cable television service at the end of each year following the beginning of construction. Such timetable shall be incorporated into the franchise and shall be enforceable as to the grantee under the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Within three months after accepting the franchise, a grantee shall furnish the town a construction schedule and map setting forth target dates consistent with subsections (b) and (c) of this section, for commencement of service to subscribers and the areas to be served. The schedule and map shall be updated whenever substantial changes become necessary. 
(e)  Every three months after the start of construction, a grantee shall furnish the town a report on progress of construction until complete. The report shall include a map that clearly defines the areas wherein regular subscribers shall be served. 
(Code 1992, § 9.5-34) 
Sec. 18-150. - Protection of privacy. 
(a)  A grantee shall not permit the transmission of nor shall a grantee receive any signal, aural, visual or digital, including polling channel selection, from any subscriber's premises without first obtaining written permission of the subscriber. This subsection is not intended to prohibit the use or transmission of signals useful only for the control or measurement of system performance. 
(b)  A grantee shall not permit the installation of any special terminal equipment in any subscriber's premises that will permit transmission from subscriber's premises of two-way services utilizing aural, visual or digital signals without first obtaining written permission of the subscriber.

Sec. 26-50. - Regulated land disturbing activities. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person may engage in any land disturbing activity until they have submitted to the town an erosion and sediment control plan for such land disturbing activity, and such plan has been reviewed and approved by the public works director. Where land disturbing activities involve lands which extend into a jurisdiction controlled by another local control program, the person responsible for the activity must submit the plan to the town and to the other jurisdiction for review and approval; and may, at their option, also submit the plan to the board for review. Where the land disturbing activity results from the construction of a single-family residence, an agreement in lieu of a plan may be substituted for an erosion and sediment control plan if executed by the program authority. 
(b)  Upon submission of an erosion and sediment control plan to the department of public works, the public works director shall, within 45 days, approve such plan if he or she determines that the plan meets the conservation standards of the town's program and if the person responsible for carrying out the plan certifies that he or she will properly perform the erosion and sediment control measures included in the plan and will conform to the provisions of this article. In addition, as a prerequisite to engaging in the land-disturbing activities shown on the approved plan, the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence to the program authority, as provided by Code of Virginia, § 62.1-44.15:52, who will be in charge of and responsible for carrying out the land-disturbing activity. However, the public works director may waive the certificate of competence requirement for an agreement in lieu of a plan for construction of a single-family residence. If a violation occurs during the land-disturbing activity, then the person responsible for carrying out the agreement in lieu of a plan shall correct the violation and provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence, as provided by Code of Virginia, § 62.1-44.15:52. Failure to provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence prior to engaging in land-disturbing activities may result in revocation of the approval of the plan and the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be subject to the penalties provided in this article. 
(c)  The public works director must act on all plans submitted within 45 days from receipt thereof by either approving such plan in writing or by disapproving such plan in writing and giving the specific reasons for its disapproval. When a plan submitted for approval under this section is found, upon review by the public works director, to be inadequate, he shall specify such modifications, terms and conditions as will permit approval of the plan and communicate these requirements to the applicant as required in this section. If no action is taken by the public works director within the time specified in this section, the plan shall be deemed approved, and the applicant shall be authorized to proceed with the proposed activity. 
(d)  An approved plan may be changed by the public works director in the following cases: 
(1)  Where inspection has revealed that the plan is inadequate to satisfy applicable regulations; or 
(2)  Where the person responsible for carrying out the approved plan finds that because of changed circumstances or for other reasons the approved plan cannot be effectively carried out, and proposed amendments to the plan consistent with the requirements of this article, are agreed to by the town and the person responsible for carrying out the approved plan. 
(e)  Should a land disturbing activity cease for more than 180 days, the public works director shall evaluate the existing approved erosion and sediment control plan to determine whether the plan still satisfies local and state erosion and sediment control criteria and to verify that all design factors are still valid. If the public works director finds the previously filed plan to be inadequate, a modified plan shall be submitted and approved prior to the resumption of land disturbing activity. 
(f)  Any person owning, occupying, or operating private, agricultural, horticultural or forest land shall not be deemed to be in violation of this article for land disturbing activities resulting from tilling, planting or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural or forest crops or products, or engineering operations under Code of Virginia, § 62.1-44.15:51 definition of the term "land disturbing activity." Such person shall comply with the provisions of this article when grading, excavating or filling. 
(g)  For the purposes of this article, when land disturbing activity will be required of a contractor performing construction work pursuant to a construction contract, the preparation, submission and approval of an erosion and sediment control plan shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property where the land disturbing activity is to occur. 
(h)  In order to prevent further erosion, the public works director shall require approval of a conservation plan for any land identified in the town as an erosion impact area. 
(i)  In accordance with the procedure set forth by Code of Virginia, § 62.1-44.15:55.E, any person engaging in the creation and operation of wetland mitigation banks in multiple jurisdictions, which have been approved and are operated in accordance with applicable federal and state guidance, laws, or regulations for the establishment, use and operation of mitigation banks, pursuant to a permit issued by the Department of Environmental Quality, the Marine Resources Commission, or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, may, at the option of that person, file general erosion and sediment control specifications for wetland mitigation banks annually with the board for review and approval consistent with guidelines established by the board. 
(j)  Where land-disturbing activities involve lands under the jurisdiction of more than one local control program an erosion and sediment control plan may, at the option of the applicant, be submitted to the board for review and approval rather than to each jurisdiction concerned. 
(k)  This section shall not apply to any state agency that undertakes a project involving a land disturbing activity, provided the agency complied with Code of Virginia, § 62.1-44.15:56.

Sec. 26-51. - Issuance of land disturbing permit. 
(a)  No person shall engage in any land disturbing activity until he has acquired a land disturbing permit from the public works director. An approved erosion and sediment control plan within an approved site plan shall constitute a land disturbing permit, and that plan will be required to be available on the site during any land disturbing activities encompassed by the approved plan. This permit shall be in addition to building and other permits required by the town and shall not be construed as meeting the requirements of any other permit. 
(b)  The public works director and other permit-issuing authorities of the town shall not issue any permit for land disturbing activities unless the applicant submits with his or her application an approved erosion and sediment control plan or certification of such approved plan from the public works director, or from the state water control board, where appropriate, as well as certification that the plan will be followed. The town, prior to issuance of any permit, will require from the applicant a reasonable performance bond, cash escrow, letter of credit, or combination thereof, to ensure that measures can be taken by the town at the applicant's expense, should he or she fail, after proper notice, within the time specified, to initiate or maintain appropriate conservation action which is required of him or her by such approved plan as a result of his land disturbing activity. The amount of the bond or other security for performance shall not exceed the total of the estimated cost to initiate and maintain appropriate conservation action based on unit price for new public or private sector construction in the town and a reasonable allowance for estimated administrative costs and inflation which shall not exceed 25 percent of the estimated cost of the conservation action. 
(c)  No permit to engage in any land disturbing activity shall be issued nor shall any erosion and sediment control plan for such land disturbing activity be approved until the following fees have been paid to the town: 
(1)  Grading plans. Grading plans for building permits on existing lots and acreage, rough grading and filling acreage parcels, and parcels with lots of five acres or more: A fee of $280.00 per division of land or disturbed acre, whichever is greater, will be paid prior to the submission of grading plans to the town. Grading plan revisions and resubmissions: A fee of $200.00 shall be paid upon the submission of a revision to a previously approved grading plan, or resubmission of a grading plan. 
(2)  Tree removal permits. Prior to the submission of a plan for the removal of trees, a fee of $75.00 shall be paid to the town. 
(3)  Floodplain studies. A fee of $1.76 per linear foot of baseline shall be paid prior to the submission to the town of a floodplain study for existing lots and acreage, rough grading and filling acreage parcels, and parcels with lots of five acres or more used for single-family residences separately built, not in conjunction with multiple construction in a subdivision development. 
(4)  Drainage studies. A fee of $556.00 shall be paid prior to the submission to the town of a drainage study for existing lots and acreage, rough grading and filling acreage parcels, and parcels of lots of five acres or more used for single-family residences separately built, not in conjunction with multiple construction in a subdivision development. 
(5)  Soil reports. A fee of $480.00 per lot shall be paid prior to the submission to the town of a soil report for existing lots and acreage, rough grading and filling acreage parcels, and parcels with lots of five acres or more used for single-family residences separately built, not in conjunction with multiple construction in a subdivision development. 
(d)  When an erosion and silt control plan is submitted in conjunction with a site plan for new construction and subdivision development as defined in division 3, article VI of chapter 78 of this Code, the fee schedule outlined in division 4 of article II of chapter 78 of this Code shall prevail.

Sec. 26-52. - Variances. 
(a)  The town may waive or modify any portion of this article that is deemed inappropriate or too restrictive for site conditions, by granting a variance. 
(b)  At the time of plan submission, an applicant may request a variance to become part of the approved erosion and sediment control plan. The applicant shall explain the reasons for requesting variances in writing to the public works director. Specific variances granted by the town shall be documented in the plan. 
(c)  The town shall consider variance requests judiciously, keeping in mind both the need of the applicant to maximize cost effectiveness and the need to protect offsite properties and resources from damage. However, this does not relieve the applicant of any other provision under this article not specifically waived by variance. 
(Code 1992, § 6-7) 
Sec. 26-53. - Monitoring, reports and inspections. 
(a)  The public works director shall periodically inspect the land disturbing activities and may require monitoring and reports from the person responsible for carrying out the plan to ensure compliance with the approved plan, and to determine whether the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling the erosion and sediment. In addition, the public works director shall require that an individual holding a certificate of competence, as provided in Code of Virginia, § 62.1-44.15:52, shall be in charge of and responsible for carrying out the land disturbing activity. However, the public works director may waive the certificate of competence requirement for an agreement in lieu of a plan for construction of a single family residence. A statement describing the maintenance responsibilities of the permittee shall be included in the approved erosion and sediment control plan. The owner, permittee or person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be given notice of the inspection. Notice of the town's right to conduct such inspections shall be expressly reserved in the permit. Periodic inspections are required on all projects. An inspection shall be made during or immediately following initial installation of erosion and sediment controls, at least once in every two-week period, within 48 hours following any runoff producing storm event, and at the completion of adequate stabilization of the project prior to the release of any performance bonds. 
(b)  If the public works director determines that the permit holder has failed to comply with the plan, the department of public works shall immediately serve upon the permit holder, by registered or certified mail to the address specified by the permittee in his permit application, or by delivery at the site of the permitted activities to the agent or employee of the permittee supervising such activities, a notice to comply. A copy of such notice shall also be sent to the issuer of the permit. Such notice shall set forth specifically the measures needed to comply and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. If the permit holder fails to comply within the time specified, he may be subject to the revocation of his permit; furthermore, he shall be deemed to be in violation of this article and upon conviction shall be subject to the penalties provided by this article. 
(Code 1992, § 6-8; Ord. No. 01-O-30, § 2, 10-9-2001; Ord. No. 03-O-02, § 2, 9-23-2003; Ord. No. 14-O-11, § 1, 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 26-54. - Appeals. 
(a)  Final decisions of the public works director under this article shall be in writing and be subject to review by the town manager. Any appeal shall be filed with the town manager within 30 days from the date of any written decision by the department of public works which adversely affects the rights, duties or privileges of the persons engaging in or proposing to engage in land disturbing activities. 
(b)  All appeals must be in writing and must contain sufficient information to acquaint the town manager with the facts involved. 
(c)  Final decision of the town manager may be appealed to the town council, provided that a written appeal is filed with the town manager within 30 days after the date of his decision. 
(d)  Final decision of the town council is subject to review by the circuit court of county, provided that the appeal is filed within 30 days of the town council's action. 
(Code 1992, § 6-9) 
Sec. 26-55. - Penalties, injunctions and civil penalties. 
(a)  Violators of this article shall be guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor, except as provided in subsection (f) of this section in the case of civil penalties. 
(b)  The town or the owner of property which has sustained damage or which is in imminent danger of being damaged, may apply to the circuit court of county for injunctive relief to enjoin a violation or a threatened violation of this article, without the necessity of showing that there does not exist an adequate remedy at law. However, an owner of property shall not apply to injunctive relief unless he has notified in writing the person who has violated the local program, and the violation of the local program has caused, or creates a probability of causing, damage to his property; and neither the person who has violated the local program nor the town has taken corrective action within 15 days to eliminate the conditions which have caused, or create the probability of causing, damage to his property. 
(c)  Any person violating or failing, neglecting or refusing to obey any injunction, mandamus or other remedy obtained pursuant to this article shall be subject, in the discretion of the court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $2,000.00 for each violation. The town may bring a civil action to assess and collect this penalty for the violation or failure. Any such civil penalty shall be paid into the town's treasury except where the town may be the violator. In the latter case, the court shall direct the penalty to be paid into the state treasury. 
(d)  With the consent of any person who has violated or failed, neglected or refused to obey any provision or condition of this article, the public works director may provide for the payment of civil charges for violations in specific sums, not to exceed the limit specified in subsection (c) of this section. Such civil charges shall be instead of any appropriate criminal penalty which could be imposed under subsections (c) or (f) of this section. 
(e)  Stop work order . Upon receipt of a sworn complaint of a violation of this section, or section 26-50 or 26-53, from the representative of the of the town or the board responsible for ensuring program compliance, the program authority may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in section 26-53(b), issue an order requiring that all or part of the land disturbing activities permitted on the site be stopped until the specified corrective measures have been taken, or, if land disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan as provided in section 26-50, requiring that all of the land disturbing activities be stopped until an approved plan or any required permits are obtained. Where the alleged noncompliance is causing or is in imminent danger of causing harmful erosion of lands or sediment deposition in waters within the watersheds of the commonwealth, or where the land disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan or any required permits, such an order may be issued without regard to whether the permittee has been issued a notice to comply as specified in section 26-53(b). Otherwise, such an order may be issued only after the permittee has failed to comply with such a notice to comply. The order shall be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in effect for a period of seven days from the date of service pending application by the town or the permit holder for appropriate relief to the county circuit court. If the alleged violator has not obtained an approved plan or any required permits within seven days from the date of service of the order, the public works director or designee may issue an order to the owner requiring that all construction and other work on the site, other than corrective measures, be stopped until an approved plan and any required permits have been obtained. Such an order shall be served upon the owner by registered or certified mail to the address specified in the permit application or the land records of the locality in which the site is located. The owner may appeal the issuance of an order to the county circuit court. Any person violating or failing, neglecting or refusing to obey an order issued by the public works director or designee may be compelled in a proceeding instituted in the county circuit court to obey such order and to comply therewith by injunction, mandamus or other appropriate remedy. 
(f)  The town may assess a civil penalty in the amount listed on the schedule below for each respective violation as follows: 
(1)  Commencement of land disturbing activity without an approved plan as required by section 26-50(a), $1,000.00 a day. 
(2)  Failure to provide or maintain vegetative measures as required by section 26-49(b)(3), $100.00 a day. 
(3)  Failure to provide or maintain structural measures as required by section 26-49(b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7), (b)(8), (b)(9), (b)(10), (b)(11), (b)(12), or (b)(13), $100.00 a day. 
(4)  Failure to provide or maintain watercourse measures as required by section 26-49(b)(14) and (b)(15), $100.00 a day. 
(5)  Failure to provide or maintain underground utility measures as required by section 26-49(b)(16), $100.00 a day. 
(6)  Failure to obey a stop work order as described in subsection (e) of this section, $100.00 a day. 
(7)  Failure to stop work order when a land disturbing permit is revoked, as described in section 26-53(b), $100.00 a day. 
(8)  Failure to provide or maintain permanent or temporary soil stabilization measures as described in section 26-49(b)(1), $100.00 a day. 
(9)  Failure to stabilize or protect soil stockpiles or borrow areas as required in section 26-49(b)(2), $100.00 a day. 
(10)  Failure to address vehicle sediment by vehicle tracking over paved or public roads as described in section 26-49(b)(17), $100.00 a day. 
(g)  Each day during which the violation is found to exist or to have existed shall constitute a separate offense. No series of specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall result in civil penalties that exceed $3,000.00, except that a series of violations arising out from the commencement of land disturbing activities without an approved plan for any site shall not result in civil penalties which exceed a total of $10,000.00. 
(h)  The existence of these civil penalties shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions, and shall preclude the prosecution of such violations as a misdemeanor. 
(i)  Any person who violates any item for which a civil penalty is prescribed shall upon such a finding by the county general district court, be assessed a civil penalty in accordance with the schedule set out in this section. The public works director, his or her deputy or a certified inspector of the town may issue a summons for collection of the civil penalty. If the penalty represented by the summons is not paid within ten days after it is delivered or mailed to the violator at the address (if mailed) on the official records of the town, the town may prosecute an action against the violator to recover the civil penalty. 
(j)  It shall be the town's burden to show the liability of the violator by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(k)  An admission or finding of liability shall not be criminal conviction for any purpose. 
(l)  Any civil penalties assessed by a court shall be paid to the town, except where the violator is the town. In the latter case, the penalties shall be paid to the state treasury. 
(m)  The civil penalties described in subsections (f)-(l) of this section shall supplement the civil penalties described in subsection (c) of this section.

In the event that there is such a disqualifying change, then the benefits shall be limited in the manner specified in section 30-64. 
(c)  In order to receive a 100 percent exemption from real estate taxes, the total combined income during the immediately preceding year shall not be greater than $52,000.00.

(a)  Application for exemption provided for by this division shall be made not later than April 1 of each year for which exemption is sought, except this date may be extended by the director to December 31 of the year following the year that application was due, if the applicant is applying for relief for the first time or if hardship conditions exist which through no fault of the applicant prohibit applying by April 1, and if proper application is made along with sworn affidavit that failure to apply was due to reasons beyond the control of the applicant. 
(b)  All applications for exemption shall be made to the director on application forms provided by the director. Each application shall be accompanied by an affidavit, setting forth the names of all persons occupying such dwelling and stating the total combined income, and the net combined financial worth of all such persons and such other information required by the director to administer the provisions of this division. If the application is made by a person filing for exemption because of permanent and total disability, the application shall also be accompanied by a certification made in accordance with Code of Virginia § 58.1-3213 stating that such person meets the definition of permanently and totally disabled specified by Code of Virginia § 58.1-3217.

Applicants approved for real estate tax relief for any calendar year thereafter pursuant to the filing of an application for exemption, shall file a certification in each of the two years following approval attesting that no information contained on the last previous years application has changed in a way that would exceed the limitations and conditions prescribed herein pertinent to the eligibility for tax relief.

Failure to file an application or certification as specified in this section shall result in denial of tax relief. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-18, § 2, 5-25-2004) 
Sec. 30-64. - Changes in ownership, income or financial worth. 
    Any changes in respect to total combined income, net combined financial worth, ownership of the dwelling exempted or other factors which occur during the taxable year for which the affidavit is filed, and which have the effect of exceeding the limitations and conditions of this Division, shall nullify any exemption for the remainder of the current tax year. In the case any person or persons who become disqualified during a calendar year because of a disqualifying increase in income or financial worth, then any such person or persons may receive a prorated exemption for the portion of the taxable year during which the taxpayer qualified for such exemption. The proceeds of a sale which would result in any such prorated exemption shall not be included in the computation of net worth or income as provided in this section. Such prorated portion shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the exemption by a fraction wherein the number of complete months of the year such property was eligible for such exemption is the numerator and the number twelve is the denominator. 
(Ord. No. 04-O-18, § 2, 5-25-2004) 
Sec. 30-65. - Amount of exemption.

However, if there is a court order pursuant to a divorce proceeding which sets forth the applicant's responsibility to pay real estate taxes on the dwelling, while residing in the dwelling, which remains jointly held after the divorce is final, applicant's ownership interest shall be deemed to be in proportion to applicant's court-ordered responsibility to pay taxes.

If such database is provided, a home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability for errors or omissions due solely to the reliance on such database, subject to 4 U.S.C. §§ 119 and 121, as amended. If no electronic database is provided by the tax commissioner, a home service provider may use an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction, and the home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect taxing jurisdiction, subject to 4 U.S.C. §§ 120 and 121, as amended. 
(e)  The tax commissioner shall require a home service provider to obtain and maintain a customer's place of primary use and the director of finance shall allow the home service provider to rely on this address as provided under 4 U.S.C. § 122, as amended. The tax commissioner may correct the place of primary use, or correct the assignment of a taxing jurisdiction by a home service provider, in accordance with 4 U.S.C. § 121, as amended. 
(f)  Nothing in this subsection modifies, impairs, supersedes, or authorizes the modification, impairment, or super session of any law allowing a taxing jurisdiction to collect a tax, charge, or fee from a customer that has failed to provide its place of primary use. 
(g)  If a customer believes that an amount of tax, charge, or fee or an assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction included on a billing is erroneous, the customer shall notify the home service provider in writing. The customer shall include in this written notification the street address for the customer's place of primary use, the account name and number for which the customer seeks a correction, a description of the error asserted by the customer, and any other information that the home service provider reasonably requires to process the request. Within 60 days of receiving a notice under this section, the home service provider shall review its records to determine the customer's taxing jurisdiction. If this review shows that the amount of tax, charge, or fee or assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is in error, the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit the amount of tax, charge, or fee erroneously collected from the customer for a period of up to two years. If this review shows that the amount of tax, charge, or fee or assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is correct, the home service provider shall provide a written explanation to the customer. The procedures in this section shall be the first course of remedy available to customers seeking correction of assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction, or a refund of or other compensation for taxes, charges, and/or fees erroneously collected by the home service provider, and no cause of action based upon a dispute arising from such taxes, charges, or fees shall accrue until a customer has reasonably exercised the rights and procedures set forth in this subsection. 
(h)  For the purposes of this division, the terms "customer," "enhanced zip code," "home service provider," "licensed service area," "serving carrier," and "taxing jurisdiction" shall have the meaning attributed to them by the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, 4 U.S.C. § 124, as amended. 
(i)  For purposes of this division, a bundled transaction of services includes services taxed under this division and consists of distinct and identifiable properties, services, or both, sold for one nonitemized charge for which the tax treatment of the distinct properties and services is different. In the case of a bundled transaction described in this subsection, if the charge is attributable to services that are taxable and services that are nontaxable, the portion of the charge attributable to the nontaxable services shall be subject to tax unless the provider can reasonably identify such nontaxable portion from its books and records kept in the regular course of business. In the case of a bundled transaction described in this subsection, if the charge for such services is attributable to services that are subject to tax at different rates, the total charge shall be treated as attributable to the services subject to tax at the highest rate unless the provider can reasonably identify the portion of the charge attributable to the services subject to tax at a lower rate from its books and records kept in the regular course of business for other purposes.

Sec. 30-143. - Methods of collection. 
(a)  The tax imposed by this article shall be evidenced by the use of a tax stamp and shall be paid by each dealer or other person liable for the tax under a reporting method deemed by the board to carry out the provisions of this article. The stamps shall be affixed in such a manner that their removal will require continued application of water or steam. Each dealer or other person liable for the tax is hereby required, and it shall be his duty, to collect and pay the tax and report all packages of 20 cigarettes on forms prescribed for this purpose by the board: 
(1)  The quantity of NVCTB stamped cigarettes sold or delivered to: 
a.  Each registered agent appointed by the board for which no tax was collected; 
b.  Each manufacturer's representative; and 
c.  Each separate person and place of business within the town during the preceding calendar month; and 
(2)  The quantity of NVCTB stamps on hand, both affixed and unaffixed on the first and the last day of the preceding calendar month and the quantity of NVCTB stamps or NVCTB stamped cigarettes received during the preceding calendar month; and 
(3)  The quantity of cigarettes on hand to which the NVCTB stamp had not been affixed on the first and last day of the preceding calendar month and the quantity of cigarettes received during the preceding calendar month to which the NVCTB stamp had not been affixed; and 
(4)  Such further information as the administrator for the board may require for the proper administration and enforcement of this article for the determination of the exact number of cigarettes in the possession of each dealer or user. 
(b)  Each dealer or other person liable for the tax shall file such reports with the board and pay the tax due to the board prior to the due date, and shall furnish copies of all cigarette tax reports submitted to the Virginia department of taxation. 
(c)  When, upon examination and audit of any invoices, records, books, cancelled checks or other memoranda touching on the purchase, sale, receipt, storage or possession of tobacco products taxed herein, any dealer or other person liable for the tax is unable to furnish evidence to the board of sufficient tax payments and stamp purchases to cover cigarettes which were sold, used, stored, received, purchased or possessed by him, the prima facie presumption shall arise that such cigarettes were received, sold, used, stored, purchased or possessed by him without the proper tax having been paid. The board shall, from the results of such examination and audit based upon such direct or indirect information available, assess the tax due and impose a penalty of ten percent and may impose interest of three-quarters of one percent per month of the gross tax due. 
(d)  When any dealer or other person liable for the tax files a false or fraudulent report or fails to file a report or fails to perform any act or performs any act to evade payment of the tax, the board shall administratively assess the tax due and impose a penalty not to exceed 50 percent of the tax due and interest of three-quarters of one percent per month of the gross tax due. 
(e)  The dealer or other person liable for the tax shall be notified by certified mail of such deficiency and such tax, penalty and interest assessed shall be due and payable within ten days after notice of such deficiency has been issued. Every dealer or other person liable for the tax shall examine each package of cigarettes to insure that the NVCTB stamp has been affixed thereto prior to offering them for sale. 
(f)  Any dealer or other person liable for the tax who shall receive cigarettes not bearing the NVCTB stamp shall, within one hour of receipt of such cigarettes, commence and with all reasonable diligence continue to affix the NVCTB stamp to each and every package of cigarettes until all unstamped packages of cigarettes have been stamped and before offering such cigarettes for sale. Any dealer or other person liable for the tax who has notified the board that he is engaged in interstate or intrastate business shall be permitted to set aside such part of his stock as may be legally kept for the conduct of such interstate or intrastate business (that is, cigarettes held for sale outside the jurisdiction of the board) without affixing the stamps required by this article. Any such interstate or intrastate stock shall be kept entirely separate and apart from the NVCTB stamped stock, in such a manner as to prevent the commingling of the interstate or intrastate stock with the NVCTB stock. Any dealer or other person liable for the tax found to have had untaxed cigarettes which have been lost, whether by negligence, theft or any other unaccountable loss, shall be liable for and shall pay the tax due thereon. 
(g)  It shall also be the duty of each dealer or other person liable for the tax to maintain and keep for a period of three years, not including the current calendar year, records of all cigarettes received, sold, stored, possessed, transferred or handled by him in any manner whatsoever, whether the same were stamped or unstamped, to make all such records available for audit, inspection and examination at all reasonable times, as well as the means, facilities and opportunity for making such audit, inspection or examination upon demand by the board.

Such bond shall be so written that, on timely payment of the premium thereon, it shall continue in force from year to year. Any applicant whose place of business is outside the town shall automatically, by filing his application, submit himself to the board's legal jurisdiction and appoint the administrator for the board as his agent for any service of lawful process. 
(b)  Upon receipt of the properly completed required application forms, and the required surety bond executed, the board shall determine whether the applicant qualifies to be a registered agent.

The board may also require such registered agent to provide proof that he has complied with all applicable laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia to legally conduct such business and to file financial statements showing all assets and liabilities. The board may revoke or suspend any registered agent's permit due to failure to file tax reports in a timely manner, non-payment of taxes due or if the cigarette tax surety bond, as required, should become impaired for any reason. 
(d)  All money collected as cigarette taxes under this article shall be deemed to be held in trust by the dealer collecting the same until remitted to the board.

For registered agents located within the jurisdictions of the board, any assessment will be based upon the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which they are located. In addition, there will be a penalty for non-reporting of ten percent of the gross tax due.

Cigarettes purchased for personal use cannot be brought into a business for resale. Only properly registered and licensed retail stores may sell cigarettes to the public. To be properly registered and licensed, a retail store must first have a valid Virginia state sales and use tax certificate and valid retail business license. Cigarettes must be purchased and stored separately for each business location. All copies of cigarette purchase invoices and receipts must be retained by the retailer for a period of three years and shall be made available to agents of the NVCTB upon request for use in conducting audits and investigations. All copies of cigarette purchase invoices and receipts must be stored at the business retail location for a period of one year from date of purchase. Failure to provide cigarette invoices and receipts may result in confiscation of cigarettes until invoices and receipts can be reviewed by the board to verify the proper tax has been paid. It is the responsibility of each retail location to insure that all cigarettes placed for sale or stored at that location be properly taxed and stamped. Cigarettes found without the NVCTB stamp or the proper jurisdictional tax paid will be seized by the agents of the board. 
(b)  Retail dealers must make their place of business available for inspection by tobacco revenue agents to insure that all cigarettes are properly stamped and all cigarettes taxes are properly paid.

Sec. 30-212. - Required. 
(a)  Every person engaging in this town in any business, trade, profession, occupation or calling (collectively in this section "a business") as defined in this article, unless otherwise exempted by law, shall apply for a license for each such business if: 
(1)  Such person maintains a definite place of business in this town; 
(2)  Such person does not maintain a definite office anywhere but does maintain an abode in this town, which abode for the purposes of this article shall be deemed a definite place of business; or 
(3)  There is no definite place of business but such person operates coin-operated amusement machines, is engaged as a peddler or itinerant merchant, carnival or circus as specified in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3717, 58.1-3718, or 58.1-3728, respectively, or is a contractor subject to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715, or is a public service corporation subject to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3731. 
(b)  A separate license shall be required for each definite place of business. A person engaged in two or more businesses or professions carried on at the same place of business may elect to obtain one license for all such businesses and professions if all of the following criteria are satisfied: 
(1)  Each business or profession is licensable at the location and has satisfied any requirements imposed by state law or other provisions of the ordinances of this town; 
(2)  All of the businesses or professions are subject to the same tax rate, or, if subject to different tax rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed on all businesses and professions at the highest rate; and 
(3)  The taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the assessor may require concerning the nature of the several businesses and their gross receipts. 
(Code 1992, § 12-3(a)) 
Sec. 30-213. - Application. 
(a)  Each person subject to a license tax shall apply for a license prior to beginning business, if he or she was not subject to licensing in this town on or before January 1 of the license year, or no later than March 1 of the current license year if he or she had been issued a license for the preceding license year. The application shall be on forms prescribed by the assessing official. 
(b)  The tax shall be paid with the application in the case of any license not based on gross receipts. If, the tax is measured by the gross receipts of the business, the tax shall be paid on or before the town's due date for filing license applications or 30 days after beginning business, as appropriate. 
(c)  The assessing official may grant an extension of time, not to exceed 90 days, in which to file an application for a license, for reasonable cause. The extension shall be conditioned upon the timely payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax, subject to adjustment to the correct tax at the end of the extension and, if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under the circumstances, a penalty of ten percent of the portion paid after the due date. 
(d)  A penalty of ten percent of the tax may be imposed upon the failure to file an application or the failure to pay the tax by the appropriate due date. Only the late filing penalty shall be imposed by the assessing official if both the application and payment are late; however, both penalties may be assessed if the assessing official determines that the taxpayer has a history of noncompliance. In the case of an assessment of additional tax made by the assessing official, if the application and, if applicable, the return were made in good faith and the understatement of the tax was not due to any fraud, reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the additional tax. If any assessment of tax by the assessing official is not paid within 30 days, the assessing official may impose a ten percent late payment penalty. The penalties shall not be imposed, or if imposed, shall be abated by the official who assessed them, if the failure to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer. In order to demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he acted responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his control. 
(e)  The term "acted responsibly" means that: 
(1)  The taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the business; and 
(2)  The taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the failure, such as requesting appropriate extensions (where applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment, acting to remove an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a failure once the impediment was removed or the failure discovered. 
(f)  The term "events beyond the taxpayer's control" include, but are not limited to, the unavailability of records due to fire or other casualty; the unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the taxpayer's reasonable reliance in good faith upon erroneous written information from the assessing official, who was aware of the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when he provided the erroneous information.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 09-O-04, § 2, adopted Feb. 10, 2009, repealed § 30-214 which pertained to interest and derived from § 12-3(f) of the 1992 Code and Ord. No. 99-O-38, § 2(12-3), adopted Oct. 26, 1999. 
Sec. 30-215. - Situs of gross receipts. 
(a)  General rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this article is measured by gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a licensable privilege at a definite place of business within this town. In the case of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities are initiated, directed or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for different classifications of business shall be attributed to one or more definite places of business or offices as follows: 
(1)  The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which his services are performed, or if his services are not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715. 
(2)  The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation activities are directed or controlled. However, a wholesaler or distribution house subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two or more localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different measures, may apply to the department of taxation for a determination as to the proper measure of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality. 
(3)  The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented from any definite place of business, then the definite place of business at which the rental of such property is managed. 
(4)  The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are performed or, if not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled. 
(b)  Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one definite place of business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed under the general rule, and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an apportionment agreement, except as to circumstances set forth in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3709, the gross receipts of the business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless some activities under the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from, such definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction shall not be attributed to this town solely because the other jurisdiction does not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction. 
(c)  Agreements. The assessor may enter into agreements with any other political subdivision of the commonwealth concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business. However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one or more political subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has, or is likely to, result in taxes on more than 100 percent of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the assessor shall make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions involved. If an agreement cannot be reached, either the assessor or taxpayer may seek an advisory opinion from the department of taxation pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3701; notice of the request shall be given to the other party. Notwithstanding the provision of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3993, when a taxpayer has demonstrated to a court that two or more political subdivisions of the commonwealth have assessed taxes on gross receipts that may create a double assessment within the meaning of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3986, the court shall enter such orders pending resolution of the litigation as may be necessary to ensure that the taxpayer is not required to pay multiple assessments even though it is not then known which assessment is correct and which is erroneous.

Sec. 30-216. - Limitations and extensions. 
(a)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed pursuant to this article, both the assessing official and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
(b)  Notwithstanding Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3903, the assessing official shall assess the local license tax omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a license for the current license year and the six preceding years. This subsection (b) applies to only 1997 and later. Prior to 1997 the assessor may only assess for the current tax year, plus three preceding years. 
(c)  The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior to the period specified in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3940, two years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to this section, two years after the final determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed pursuant to section 30-217(b) or (d), or two years after the final decision in a court application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984, or similar law for which collection has been stayed, whichever is later.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3703.1 A.4. 
Sec. 30-217. - Administrative appeals and rulings. 
(a)  Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of an appealable event as defined in this article may file an administrative appeal of the assessment within one year from the last day of the tax year for which such assessment is made, or within one year from the date of the appealable event, whichever is later, with the director of finance. The appeal must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, the tax periods covered by the challenged assessments, the amount in dispute, the remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The director of finance may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and documents, an audit or further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of the appeal. The assessment placed at issue in the appeal shall be deemed prima facie correct. The director of finance shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a written determination to the taxpayer setting forth the facts and arguments in support of his or her decision. 
(b)  Every assessment made by a director of finance pursuant to an appealable event shall include or be accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to file an administrative appeal and the specific procedures to be followed in the jurisdiction, the name and address to which the appeal should be directed, an explanation of the required content of the appeal, and the deadline for filing the appeal. 
(c)  Provided a timely and complete administrative appeal is filed, collection activity with respect to the amount in dispute shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the director of finance, unless the director of finance (i) determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay as defined in this article; (ii) is advised by the director of finance that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time; or (iii) is advised by the director of finance that the appeal is frivolous as defined in this article. No further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. 
(d)  Any taxpayer whose administrative appeal to the director of finance pursuant to the provisions of this article has been pending for more than one year without the issuance of a final determination may, upon not less than 30 days' written notice to the director of finance, elect to treat the appeal as denied and appeal the assessment to the tax commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this article. The tax commissioner shall not consider an appeal filed pursuant to the provisions of this article if he or she finds that the absence of a final determination on the part of the director of finance was caused by the willful failure or refusal of the taxpayer to provide information requested and reasonably needed by the director of finance to make his or her determination. 
(e)  Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of a determination, upon an administrative appeal to the director of finance pursuant to this article, that is adverse to the position asserted by the taxpayer in such appeal may appeal such assessment to the tax commissioner within 90 days of the date of the determination by the director of finance. The appeal shall be in such form as the tax commissioner may prescribe and the taxpayer shall serve a copy of the appeal upon the director of finance. The tax commissioner shall permit the director of finance to participate in the proceedings, and shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within 90 days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and the assessing official are notified that a longer period will be required. The appeal shall proceed in the same manner as an application pursuant to § 58.1-1821, Code of Virginia and the tax commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to § 58.1-1822, Code of Virginia. 
(f)  On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the tax commissioner under this article, collection activity with respect to the amount in dispute shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the tax commissioner, unless the director of finance (i) determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay as defined in this section; (ii) is advised by the director of finance, or the tax commissioner, that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time; or (iii) is advised by the director of finance that the appeal is frivolous as defined in this article. No further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The requirement that collection activity be suspended shall cease unless an appeal pursuant to this article is filed and served on the necessary parties within 30 days of the service of notice of intent to file such appeal. 
(g)  Promptly upon receipt of the final determination of the tax commissioner with respect to an appeal pursuant to this article, the director of finance shall take those steps necessary to calculate the amount of tax owed by or refund due to the taxpayer consistent with the tax commissioner's determination and shall provide that information to the taxpayer and to the director of finance in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(1)  If the determination of the tax commissioner sets forth a specific amount of tax due, the director of finance shall issue a bill to the taxpayer for such amount due and penalty, if any is authorized by this article, within 30 days of the date of the determination of the tax commissioner. 
(2)  If the determination of the tax commissioner sets forth a specific amount of refund due, the director of finance shall issue a payment to the taxpayer for such amount due within 30 days of the date of the determination of the tax commissioner. 
(3)  If the determination of the tax commissioner does not set forth a specific amount of tax due, or otherwise requires the director of finance to undertake a new or revised assessment that will result in an obligation to pay a tax that has not previously been paid in full, the director of finance shall promptly commence the steps necessary to undertake such new or revised assessment, and provide the same to the taxpayer within 60 days of the date of the determination of the tax commissioner, or within 60 days after receipt from the taxpayer of any additional information requested or reasonably required under the determination of the tax commissioner, whichever is later. The director of finance shall issue a bill to the taxpayer for the amount due and penalty, if any is authorized by this article, within 30 days of the date of the new assessment. 
(4)  If the determination of the tax commissioner does not set forth a specific amount of refund due, or otherwise requires the director of finance to undertake a new or revised assessment that will result in an obligation on the part of the town to make a refund of taxes previously paid, the director of finance shall promptly commence the steps necessary to undertake such new or revised assessment, and provide the same to the taxpayer within 60 days of the date of the determination of the tax commissioner, or within 60 days after receipt from the taxpayer of any additional information requested or reasonably required under the determination of the tax commissioner, whichever is later. The director of finance shall issue a refund to the taxpayer for the amount of tax due within 30 days of the date of the new assessment. 
(h)  Following the issuance of a final determination of the tax commissioner pursuant to this article, the taxpayer or the director of finance may apply to the appropriate circuit court for judicial review of the determination, or any part thereof, pursuant to § 58.1-3984, Code of Virginia. In any such proceeding for judicial review of a determination of the tax commissioner, the burden shall be on the party challenging the determination of the tax commissioner, or any part thereof, to show that the ruling of the tax commissioner is erroneous with respect to the part challenged. Neither the tax commissioner nor the department of taxation shall be made a party to an application to correct an assessment merely because the tax commissioner has ruled on it. 
(i)  (1)  On receipt of a notice of intent to file an application for judicial review, pursuant to § 58.1-3984, Code of Virginia, of a determination of the tax commissioner pursuant to this article, and upon payment of the amount of the tax that is not in dispute together with any penalty then due with respect to such undisputed portion of the tax, the director of finance shall further suspend collection activity while the court retains jurisdiction unless the court, upon appropriate motion after notice and an opportunity to be heard, determines that (i) the taxpayer's application for judicial review is frivolous, as defined in this article; (ii) collection would be jeopardized by delay, as defined in this article; or (iii) suspension of collection would cause substantial economic hardship to the town. For purposes of determining whether substantial economic hardship to the town would arise from a suspension of collection activity, the court shall consider the cumulative effect of then-pending appeals filed within the town by different taxpayers that allege common claims or theories of relief. 
(2)  Upon a determination that the appeal is frivolous, that collection may be jeopardized by delay, or that suspension of collection would result in substantial economic hardship to the town, the court may require the taxpayer to pay the amount in dispute or a portion thereof, or to provide surety for payment of the amount in dispute in a form acceptable to the court. 
(3)  No suspension of collection activity shall be required if the application for judicial review fails to identify with particularity the amount in dispute. 
(4)  The requirement that collection activity be suspended shall cease unless an application for judicial review pursuant to § 58.1-3984, Code of Virginia, is filed and served on the necessary parties within 30 days of the service of the notice of intent to file such application. 
(5)  The suspension of collection activity authorized by this article shall not be applicable to any appeal of a local license tax that is initiated by the direct filing of an action pursuant to § 58.1-3984, Code of Virginia, without prior exhaustion of the appeals provided by this article. 
(j)  (1)  Payment of any refund determined to be due pursuant to the determination of the tax commissioner of an appeal pursuant to this article shall be suspended if the town serves upon the taxpayer, within 60 days of the date of the determination of the tax commissioner, a notice of intent to file an application for judicial review of the tax commissioner's determination pursuant to § 58.1-3984, Code of Virginia, and pays the amount of the refund not in dispute.

    The purpose of this division is to establish purchasing policies for the town for the procurement from nongovernmental sources of goods, materials, supplies, equipment, contracts, insurances and services necessary or desirable for the efficient and/or effective operation of the town government. It is the intent of the town council that competition is sought to the maximum practicable degree, that the rules governing contract awards be made clear in advance of the competition, that specifications reflect the procurement needs of the town rather than being drawn to favor a particular vendor, that the town and prospective vendors freely exchange information concerning what is sought to be procured and what is offered, that procurement procedures be fair and impartial with the avoidance of any impropriety, that all qualified vendors have access to the town's business, and that the town obtain high quality goods and services at a reasonable cost and, all other factors being equal, at the lowest available cost.

(b)  Where a procurement transaction involves the expenditure of federal assistance or federal contract funds, the receipt of which is conditioned upon compliance with mandatory requirements in federal laws or regulations, not in conformance with the provisions of this division, the town may comply with such federal requirements, notwithstanding the provisions of this division and any otherwise applicable provisions of the Virginia Public Procurement Act, upon the written determination of the town council that acceptance of the grant or contract funds under the applicable conditions is in the public interest. Such determination shall state the applicable provision of this division and of the Virginia Public Procurement Act, if any, which is or are in conflict with the conditions of the grant or contract. In such cases, the procurement shall be made in accordance with the applicable mandatory federal laws or regulations.

Sec. 30-308. - Procedures required for competitive sealed bidding. 
(a)  Definition of competitive sealed bidding. Competitive sealed bidding is a method of contractor selection that involves the process of inviting and obtaining bids submitted in sealed envelopes from competing sources in response to advertised specifications, by which an award is made to the lowest and best bidder meeting the specifications. Each bidder must bid on the same advertised specifications, terms and conditions in all the items and parts of a contract. It does not include, for the most part, discussions or negotiations with the bidders. It is the preferred method for acquiring goods, services and construction by the Virginia Public Procurement Act. 
(b)  Invitation to bid. A written invitation to bid shall be prepared and a complete copy thereof provided to all persons requesting the copy. The invitation to bid shall contain or incorporate by reference the specifications and contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. If the invitation to bid does not provide for prequalification of bidders, any requisite qualifications or potential contractors shall be stated therein. When it is impractical to prepare initially a purchase description to support an award based on prices, an invitation to bid may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation to bid limited to those bidders whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. No invitation to bid for construction services shall condition a successful bidder's eligibility on having a specified experience modification factor. For the purposes of this subdivision, "experience modification factor" means a value assigned to an employer as determined by a rate service organization in accordance with its uniform experience rating plan required to be filed pursuant to state law. 
(c)  Notice of invitation to bid. Notice inviting bids shall be published at least ten days prior to the date set for receipt of bids by posting on the Virginia Department of General Services' central electronic procurement website, eVA, to provide the public with centralized visibility and to the town's webpage. In addition, the town may publish in a newspaper of general circulation. The procurement official may solicit bids directly from potential contractors. 
(d)  Contents of notice. The notice required in this section shall include a brief description of the divisions to be purchased or sold, and shall state where invitations to bid and specifications may be secured, and shall state the time and place for the opening of the bids and, if different, the last day set for the submission of bids. If prequalification is required, such requirement shall be stated in the notice along with information as to where information concerning the prequalification procedure may be obtained. If prequalification of bidders is not required, the notice of invitation to bid shall include a statement of any requisite qualifications of potential contractors. The procurement official or officer may also solicit sealed bids by additional advertising. 
(e)  Prequalification of bidders. 
(1)  Prospective contractors may be required to prequalify for particular types of goods, services, insurance or construction, and consideration of bids limited to prequalified contractors. Any prequalification procedure utilized shall be established in writing by the procurement official sufficiently in advance of its implementation to allow potential contractors a fair opportunity to complete the process. Any prequalification procedure may require prospective contractors to submit such information as the procurement official or officer shall deem appropriate including, but not limited to, financial reports and references. 
(2)  The procurement official may refuse to prequalify any prospective contractor, provided that a statement of the reasons for such a refusal to prequalify is made in writing, is provided to the prospective contractor thereby denied prequalification, and is made a part of the record in each case. 
(3)  In considering requests for prequalification, the procurement official or officer shall determine whether there is reason to believe that the prospective contractor possesses the management, financial soundness and history of performance which indicate apparent ability to complete successfully the plans and specifications of the invitation to bid. 
(4)  Prequalification of a bidder shall not constitute a conclusive determination that the bidder is responsible, and such a bidder may be rejected as nonresponsible on the basis of subsequently discovered information. 
(5)  Failure of a bidder to prequalify with respect to a given procurement shall not bar the bidder from seeking prequalification as to future procurements, or from bidding on procurements which do not require prequalification. 
(6)  Prequalification of bidders for construction contracts shall be in accordance with section 30-310. 
(f)  Withdrawal of bid due to error. 
(1)  A bidder for a town contract, other than a contract for construction or maintenance of public highways, may withdraw his bid from consideration if the price bid was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake in the bid, provided that the bid was submitted in good faith and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of a bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. 
If a bid contains both clerical and judgment mistakes, a bidder may withdraw his bid from consideration if the price bid would have been substantially lower than the other bids due solely to the clerical mistake, that was an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of a bid that shall be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. 
(2)  One of the following procedures for bid withdrawal shall be selected by the procurement official or officer and shall be stated in the notice of invitation to bid or request for proposals, other than contracts for construction or maintenance of public highways: 
a.  The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure and shall submit original work papers with such notice; or 
b.  The bidder shall submit to the town procurement official his original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid within one day after the date fixed for submission of bids. The work papers shall be delivered by the bidder in person or by registered mail at or prior to the time fixed for the opening of bids. The bids shall be opened one day following the time fixed by the town for the submission of bids. Thereafter, the bidder shall have two hours after the opening of bids within which to claim in writing any mistake as defined in this section and withdraw his bid. The contract shall not be awarded by the town until the two-hour period has elapsed. Such mistake shall be proved only from the original work papers, documents and materials delivered as required herein. 
The work papers, documents and materials submitted by the bidder shall, at the bidder's request, be considered trade secrets or proprietary information subject to the conditions of section 30-312(7)f. 
(3)  No bid may be withdrawn under this subsection when the result would be the awarding of the contract on another bid of the same bidder or of another bidder in which the ownership of the withdrawing bidder is more than five percent. 
(4)  If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this subsection, the lowest remaining bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
(5)  No bidder who is permitted to withdraw a bid shall, for compensation, supply any material or labor to or perform any subcontract or other work agreement for the person to whom the contract is awarded, or otherwise benefit, directly or indirectly, from the performance of the project for which the withdrawn bid was submitted. 
(6)  The procurement official shall notify the bidder in writing within five business days of its decision regarding the bidder's request to withdraw its bid. If the procurement official denies the withdrawal of a bid under the provisions of this section, it shall state in such notice the reasons for its decision and award the contract to such bidder at the bid price, provided such bidder is a responsible and responsive bidder. At the same time that the notice is provided, the procurement official shall return all work papers and copies thereof that have been submitted by the bidder. 
(g)  Bid opening. 
(1)  Bids shall be submitted sealed in accordance with the instructions in the invitation to bid and shall be identified as to the nature of the bid on the envelope. Any bid which is not submitted in an envelope identified as a bid may, but need not be, considered and/or accepted by the town if misplaced or not opened at the time of the public opening of the bids. 
(2)  Bids shall be opened in public and announced at the time and place stated in the public notice of invitation to bid. If a bid should accidentally be opened by town personnel prior to the announced bid opening, the bid shall be immediately resealed, and the contents shall not be disclosed to anyone prior to the opening of the bids in public at the time and place stated in the public notices. 
(h)  Bid evaluation. 
(1)  In determining the lowest responsible bidder, in addition to price, the procurement official or officer shall consider: 
a.  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
b.  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
c.  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder; 
d.  The quality of performance of previous contacts or services; 
e.  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or service; 
f.  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service; 
g.  The quality and availability of the goods or services and the adaptability of the goods or services to the particular use required; 
h.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract; 
i.  The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid and the terms of the bid; 
j.  In addition, evaluation of bids shall be based upon the requirements set forth in the notice of invitation to bid. Also, special qualifications of potential contractors, life cycle costing, value analysis and any other criteria such as inspection, testing or delivery, which are helpful in determining acceptability of bids may be considered. 
(2)  At the same time the bids are evaluated, using the relevant criteria set out in this subsection (g), the procurement officer shall determine in writing whether the apparent low bidder is responsible. If the procurement officer so determines, then the town may proceed with an award in accordance with subsection (h) of this section. If the procurement officer determines that the apparent low bidder is not responsible, he shall proceed as in section 30-316(b)(3). 
(i)  Contract award. 
(1)  Contracts, when awarded, shall be awarded to the responsive bidder who is determined to be the lowest responsible bidder. Except as otherwise permitted in this section, no award may be made without prior approval by the town council by means of a resolution approving the award. Except as otherwise permitted in this section, when the terms and conditions of multiple bids are so provided in the invitation to bid, awards may be made to more than one bidder. 
(2)  Unless cancelled or rejected, a responsive bid from the lowest responsible bidder shall be accepted as submitted, except that if the bid from the apparent lowest responsible bidder exceeds available funds, the procurement official or officer may negotiate with the apparent lowest responsible bidder to try to obtain a contract price within available funds, provided that the town council has approved the written conditions and procedures under which such negotiation may be undertaken prior to issuance of the invitation to bid, and that such conditions and procedures are summarized therein. 
(j)  Tie bids. In the case of a tie bid, preference shall be given to goods, services and construction produced in the town or provided by persons, firms or corporations having principal places of business in the town, if such a choice is available. If the previous sentence cannot be applied, preference shall be given to goods, services and construction produced in Virginia or provided by Virginia persons, firms or corporations, if such a choice is available. If the previous two sentences cannot be applied, in instances where goods are being offered, and existing price preferences have already been taken into account, preference shall be given to the bidder whose goods contain the greatest amount of recycled content. Whenever any bidder is a resident of any other state and such state under its laws allows a resident contractor of that state preference, a like preference may be allowed to the lowest responsible bidder who is a resident of Virginia. 
(k)  Notification to lowest responsible bidder of award. When awarded, the contract shall be awarded or notice of intent to award shall be issued, and written notice of the award or intent to award shall be sent, to the successful bidder with reasonable promptness, and posted in the office of the procurement official. 
(Code 1992, § 8-106(c); Ord. No. 01-O-31, § 2, 10-9-2001; Ord. No. 07-O-17, § 3, 5-22-2007; Ord. No. 16-O-34 , § 1, 12-13-2016) 
Sec. 30-309. - Competitive negotiation. 
(a)  Definition of competitive negotiation. Competitive negotiation is a method of contractor selection which involves individual discussions between the town and at least two of the offerors (if available) deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals on the basis of responses to the town's request for proposals. 
(b)  Public notice. At least ten days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals by posting on the Virginia Department of General Services' central electronic procurement website or other appropriate websites. Additionally, the town shall publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where contract performance will occur so as to provide reasonable notice to the maximum number of offerors that are reasonably anticipated to submit proposals in response to the particular request. In addition, the procurement official or officer may solicit proposals directly from potential contractors. 
(c)  Request for proposals. Requests for proposals shall be in writing and shall indicate in general terms the good, service or item intended for acquisition through the procurement process, specifying the factors that will be used in evaluating the proposal, indicate the scoring system intended for use in evaluating proposals such as a numerical scoring system and containing or incorporating by reference other applicable contractual terms and conditions, including any unique capabilities, specifications or qualifications which will be required of the contractor. In the event that a numerical scoring system is used in the evaluation of proposals, include the point values assigned to each of the evaluation criteria in the request for proposal or posted at the location designated for public posting of procurement notices prior to the due date and time for receiving proposals. No request for proposal for construction authorized by this section shall condition a successful offeror's eligibility on having a specified experience modification factor. For purposes of this section, "experience modification factor" means a value assigned to an employer as determined by a rate service organization in accordance with its uniform experience rating plan required to be filed pursuant to subsection D of Code of Virginia, § 38.2-1913. 
(d)  Professional services; costs. Except as otherwise provided in this division, professional services shall be procured by competitive negotiation. However, where the aggregate cost or sum of all phases of the professional services does not exceed or is not expected to exceed, $60,000.00, procurement may be accomplished by other than competitive negotiation if, in the opinion of the procurement official it is in the best interests of the town so to do. 
(1)  For professional services, the town shall engage in individual discussions with two or more offerors deemed fully qualified, responsible and suitable on the basis of initial responses and with emphasis on professional competence, to provide the required services. Repetitive informal interviews are permissible. The town shall encourage the offerors to elaborate on their qualifications and performance data or staff expertise pertinent to the proposed project, as well as alternative concepts. In addition, the town shall inform the offerors of any ranking criteria that is intended for use by the town in addition to the review of the professional competence of the offeror. The request for proposal shall not, however, request that offerors furnish estimates of man-hours or cost for services. At the discussion stage, the town may discuss nonbinding estimates of total project costs, including, but not limited to, life-cycle costing, and where appropriate, nonbinding estimates of price for services. In accordance with section 30-312(7)f., the town shall not disclose proprietary information from competing offerors to the public or to competitors. At the conclusion of discussions, outlined under this section, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the request for proposal and all information developed in the selection process to this point, the public body shall select in the order of preference two or more offerors whose professional qualifications and proposed services are deemed most meritorious. 
Negotiations shall then be conducted, beginning with the offeror ranked first. If a contract satisfactory and advantageous to the public body is negotiated at a price considered fair and reasonable, the town shall award to that offeror. Otherwise, the town shall formally terminate negotiations with the offeror ranked first, and shall begin conducting negotiations with the offeror ranked second, and so on until such a contract is negotiated at a fair and reasonable price. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms and conditions for multiple awards are included in the request for proposal, the town may award contracts to more than one offeror. 
Should the town determine in writing and in its sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, the town may negotiate and award a contract to that offeror. 
(e)  Reserved. 
(f)  Competitive negotiation impracticable or disadvantageous. Upon a written determination made in advance by the procurement official that competitive negotiation is either not practicable or not fiscally advantageous, insurance may be procured through a licensed agent or broker selected in the manner provided for the procurement of goods or services other than professional services in subsection (h) of this section. The basis for this determination shall be documented in writing. 
(g)  Construction. Construction may be procured only by competitive sealed bidding, except that competitive negotiation may be used in the following instances upon a determination made in advance by the town council and set forth in writing that competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not fiscally advantageous to the public, which writing shall document the basis for this determination: 
(1)  For the alteration, repair, renovation or demolition of buildings or structures when the contract price is not expected to exceed $1,500,000.00; 
(2)  For the construction of highways and any draining, dredging, excavation, grading or similar work upon real property; or 
(3)  For the construction, alteration, repair, renovation or demolition of buildings by the town council on a fixed price design-build basis or construction management basis under Code of Virginia § 2.2-4308 when the contract is not expected to cost more than $1,500,000.00. 
(h)  Evaluation factors and award for other than professional services. The town council shall award any contract under this subsection where the cost of the procurement exceeds or is expected to exceed $50,000.00 for spot purchases or $100,000.00 for multi-year contracts; and the procurement official or officer shall award any such contract when the cost for such procurement is or is expected to be $50,000.00 or less for spot purchases or single year contracts, or $100,000.00 or less for multi-year contracts. For goods, nonprofessional services and insurance, selection shall be made of two or more offerors deemed to be fully qualified and best suited among those submitting proposals, on the basis of the factors involved in the request for proposals, including price, if so stated in the request for proposals. Negotiations shall then be conducted with each of the offerors so selected. Price shall be considered, but need not be the sole determining factor. After negotiations have been conducted with each offeror so selected, the procurement official or officer or the town council as appropriate will select the offeror who in its opinion has made the best proposal, and if the contract is awarded shall award the contract to that offeror. When the terms and conditions of multiple awards are provided for in the request for proposal, awards may be made to more than one offeror. Should the procurement official or officer or the town council, as appropriate determine in writing in its sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified, or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror. 
(i)  Evaluation factors, discussion and award with regard to professional services. The town council shall award any contract under this subsection where the cost of the procurement exceeds or is expected to exceed $60,000.00; and the procurement official or officer shall award any such contract when the cost for such procurement is or is expected to be less than $60,000.00. The procurement official or officer shall engage in individual discussions with two or more offerors deemed fully qualified, responsible and suitable on the basis of initial responses to the request for proposals and with the emphasis on professional competence, to provide the required services. Repetitive informal interviews shall be permissible. Such offerors shall be encouraged to elaborate on their qualifications and performance data or staff expertise pertinent to the proposed project, as well as alternative concepts. In addition, offerors shall be informed of any ranking criteria that will be used by the town in addition to the review of the professional competence of the offeror. At the discussion stage, the procurement official or officer may discuss nonbinding estimates of total project costs, including, but not limited to, life-cycle costing, and where appropriate, nonbinding estimates of price for services. Proprietary information from competing offerors shall not be disclosed to the public or to competitors. At the conclusion of such discussions, on the basis of evaluation factors published in the request for proposal and all information developed in the selection process to this point, the procurement official or officer shall select in the order of preference two or more offerors whose professional qualifications and proposed services are deemed most meritorious. Negotiations shall then be conducted, beginning with the offeror ranked first. If a contract satisfactory and advantageous to the town can be negotiated at a price considered fair and reasonable, the procurement official or officer may award or recommend as appropriate that award be made to that offeror. Otherwise, negotiations conducted with the offeror ranked first shall be formally terminated and negotiations conducted with the offeror ranked second, and so on until such a contract can be negotiated at a fair and reasonable price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the terms and conditions for multiple awards are included in the request for proposal, a procurement official or officer, or the town council, may award contracts to more than one offeror. Should the procurement official or officer or town council, as appropriate determine in writing in its sole discretion that only one offeror is fully qualified, or that one offeror is clearly more highly qualified and suitable than the others under consideration, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that offeror. 
(j)  Architectural and professional engineering term contracting; limitations. 
(1)  A contract for architectural or professional engineering services relating to multiple construction projects may be awarded by the town, provided (i) the projects require similar experience and expertise, (ii) the nature of the projects is clearly identified in the request for proposal, and (iii) the contract is limited to a term of one year or when the cumulative total project fees reach the maximum authorized in this section, whichever occurs first. Such contracts may be renewable for four additional one-year terms at the option of the town. The fair and reasonable prices as negotiated shall be used in determining the cost of each project performed. 
(2)  The sum of all projects performed in a one-year contract term shall not exceed $500,000.00. 
(3)  Competitive negotiations for such architectural or professional engineering services contracts may result in awards to more than one offeror, provided (i) the request for proposal so states and (ii) the town has established procedures for distributing multiple projects among the selected contractors during the contract term. Such procedures shall prohibit requiring the selected contractors to compete for individual projects based on price. 
(4)  The fee for any single project shall not exceed $100,000.00. 
(5)  For the purposes of subsection (2), any unused amounts from one contract term shall not be carried forward to any additional term. 
(k)  Multiphase professional services contracts satisfactory and advantageous to the town to the completion of large, phased, or long-term projects may be negotiated and awarded based on a fair and reasonable price for the first phase only, when completion of the earlier phases is necessary to provide information critical to the negotiation of a fair and reasonable price for succeeding phases. Prior to the procurement of any such contract, the town shall state the anticipated intended total scope of the project and determine in writing that the nature of the work is such that the best interests of the town require awarding the contract. 
(l)  Job order contracting; limitations . 
(1)  A job order contract may be awarded by a town for multiple jobs, provided (i) the jobs require similar experience and expertise, (ii) the nature of the jobs is clearly identified in the solicitation, and (iii) the contract is limited to a term of one year or when the cumulative total project fees reach the maximum authorized in this section, whichever occurs first. Contractors may be selected through either competitive sealed bidding or competitive negotiation. 
(2)  Such contracts may be renewable for two additional one-year terms at the option of the town. The fair and reasonable prices as negotiated shall be used in determining the cost of each job performed, and the sum of all jobs performed in a one-year contract term shall not exceed $5,000,000.00. Individual job orders shall not exceed $500,000.00. 
(3)  For the purposes of this section, any unused amounts from one contract term shall not be carried forward to any additional term. 
(4)  Order splitting with the intent of keeping a job order under the maximum dollar amounts prescribed in subsection (2) is prohibited. 
(5)  The town shall not issue or use a job order, under a job order contract, solely for the purpose of receiving professional architectural or engineering services that constitute the practice of architecture or the practice of engineering as those terms are defined in Code of Virginia, § 54.1-400. However, professional architectural or engineering services may be included on a job order where such professional services (i) are incidental and directly related to the job, (ii) do not exceed $25,000.00 per job order, and (iii) do not exceed $75,000.00 per contract term. 
(6)  Job order contracting shall not be used for construction, maintenance, or asset management services for a highway, bridge, tunnel, or overpass.

Sec. 30-310. - Prequalification of bidders for construction contractors. 
(a)  On order of the procurement official, the prequalification for prospective contractors may occur for particular types of supplies, services, insurance or construction, and consideration of bids or proposals limited to prequalified contractors. 
(b)  The town may adopt a prequalification process for prospective contractors for construction and shall apply such a prequalification process for construction projects adopted by the town. The process shall be consistent with the provisions of this section and the application form used in the prequalification process shall set forth the criteria upon which the qualifications of prospective contractors will be evaluated. The application form shall request of prospective contractors only such information as is appropriate for an objective evaluation of all prospective contractors pursuant to such criteria. Such form shall allow the prospective contractor seeking prequalification to request, by checking the appropriate box, that all information voluntarily submitted by the contractor pursuant to this section shall be considered a trade secret or proprietary information subject to the provisions of section 30-312(7)f. and the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. 
(c)  When the procurement official requires prequalification of potential contractors for construction projects, the procurement officer shall notify prospective contractors of the deadline for the submission of prequalification applications. The deadline for submission shall be sufficiently in advance of the date set for the submission of bids for such construction to allow the completion of procedures set forth in this section. 
(d)  At least 30 days prior to the date established for submission of bids or proposals under the procurement of the contract for which the prequalification applies, the procurement officer shall advise in writing each contractor which submitted an application whether that contractor has been prequalified. If a contractor is denied prequalification, the written notification to such contractor shall state the reasons for such denial of prequalification and their factual basis. 
(e)  A decision by the town denying prequalification under the provisions of this subsection shall be final and conclusive unless the contractor appeals the decision as provided in Code of Virginia, § 11-63. 
(f)  The procurement officer may deny prequalification to any contractor only if the procurement officer finds one of the following: 
(1)  The contractor does not have sufficient financial ability to perform the contract that would result from such procurement. If a bond is required to ensure performance of a contract, evidence that the contractor can acquire a surety bond from a corporation included on the United States Treasury list of acceptable surety corporations in the amount and type required by the procurement officer shall be sufficient to establish the financial ability of such contractor to perform the contract resulting from such procurement. 
(2)  The contractor does not have appropriate experience to perform the construction project in question. 
(3)  The contractor or any officer, director or owner thereof, has had judgments entered against him within the past ten years for the breach of contracts for governmental or nongovernmental construction including, but not limited to, design-build or construction management. 
(4)  The contractor has been in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of prior construction contracts with a public body without good cause. If the town has not contracted with a contractor in any prior construction contracts, the procurement officer may deny prequalification if the contractor has been in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of comparable construction contracts with another public body without good cause. The procurement officer may not utilize this subsection to deny prequalification unless the facts underlying such substantial noncompliance were documented in writing in the prior construction project file and such information related thereto given to the contractor at that time, with the opportunity to respond. 
(5)  The contractor, or any officer, director, owner, project manager, procurement manager or chief financial official thereof, has been convicted within the past ten years of a crime related to governmental or nongovernmental construction or contracting including, but not limited to, a violation of Code of Virginia, § 11-72 et seq., the Virginia Governmental Frauds Act, Code of Virginia, §§ 18.2-498.1 et seq., 59.1-68.6 et seq., or any substantially similar law of the United States or another state. 
(6)  The contractor, or any officer, director or owner thereof, is currently debarred pursuant to an established debarment procedure from bidding or contracting by any public body, agency of another state or agency of the federal government.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, Code of Virginia, § 11-46 B. 
Sec. 30-311. - Exceptions to the requirement of competitive sealed bidding or competitive negotiation. 
(a)  Sole source procurement. Upon a determination in writing by the town council (or the procurement official or officer for contracts that do not or that are not expected to exceed $50,000.00 in cost for a spot purchase or single year contract, or $100,000.00 for a multi-year contract) that there is only one source practicably available for that which is to be procured, a contract may be negotiated and awarded to that source without competitive sealed bidding or competitive negotiation. The writing shall document the basis for such determination. Public award notices shall be posted on the Virginia Department of General Services' central electronic procurement website (eVA) or in a designated public area and on the town's procurement webpage or may be published in a newspaper of general circulation on the day the town council, procurement official or officer awards or announces its decision to award the contract, whichever occurs first. 
(b)  Emergency purchases. 
(1)  In case of emergency, a contract may be awarded by the procurement official or officer without competitive sealed bidding or competitive negotiation; however, such procurement shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the contract file. 
(2)  If any emergency occurs during regular town business hours, the using department shall immediately notify the procurement official or officer who shall either purchase the required supplies goods or services or authorize the using department to do so. 
(3)  If an emergency occurs at times other than regular business hours, and reasonable attempts to contact the procurement official or officer have failed, the using department may purchase directly the required supplies, goods or services. The department shall, however, to the extent as is practicable under the circumstance, secure competitive telephone bids, and the department shall order delivery to be made by the equivalent of the lowest responsible bidder. The head of the using department shall personally verify and promptly submit to the procurement official or officer a requisition, a tabulation of bids received, a copy of any delivery record received and a brief written explanation of the circumstances of the emergency and the reasons for choosing the bidder selected. 
(4)  In any situation where an emergency procurement occurs, the town shall issue a written notice stating that the contract is being awarded on an emergency basis, and identifying that which is being procured, the contractor selected, and the date on which the contract was or will be awarded. Public award notices shall be posted on the Virginia Department of General Services' central electronic procurement website (eVA) or in a designated public area and on the town's procurement webpage or may be published in a newspaper of general circulation on the day the town council, procurement official or officer awards or announces its decision to award the contract, whichever occurs first, or as soon thereafter as is practicable. 
(c)  Small purchases. 
(1)  The procurement official is authorized to establish small purchase procedures for any contract or purchase order where the estimated total of the materials, equipment, supplies, shipping, insurance, construction or service does not exceed or is not expected to exceed $50,000.00 for any spot purchase or single year contract, and any multi-year contract not exceeding or not expected to exceed $100,000.00 in the aggregate. Such procurements may be made without the necessity of competitive sealed bidding or competitive negotiations. Contract requirements shall not be artificially divided so as to constitute small purchases for the purpose of qualifying under this provision. 
(2)  Under small purchase procedures, quotations shall be solicited by the procurement official or officer, from three or more contractors or vendors, unless the procurement official or officer, in general or in specific cases, determines that using the procedures and standards of this division that such quotes would not be possible or practical. Award, if made, shall be made to the responsible contractor or vendor making the best overall offer, considering such factors as price, quality, utility and the need for prompt delivery as well as the town's experience with and the reliability of the offeror. The names of the contractor or vendor submitting a quotation and the dates and amounts of each quotation, shall be recorded and maintained as a public record. Contract requirements shall not be artificially divided so as to constitute small purchases for the purpose of qualifying under this provision. 
(3)  Contracts or purchase orders to any single vendor not exceeding $5,000.00 per order with a maximum amount of $50,000.00 per department in a fiscal year shall not be subject to the town's small purchase requirements. Departments will solicit quotations and retain a written record as documentation of the contractor's pricing. The prohibition against artificially dividing contract requirements shall apply to all purchases regardless of amount. 
(d)  Auctions. Upon a determination made in advance by the town council, or procurement official for goods not exceeding or not expected to exceed $30,000.00 in cost, and set forth in writing that the purchase of goods from the public auction sale is in the best interests of the public, such items may be purchased at the auction including online public auctions. The writing shall document the basis for this determination. 
(e)  Miscellaneous exceptions to requirement for competitive procurement. The following transactions are hereby exempt from the competitive procurement requirements of this division: 
(1)  The purchase of goods and services which are performed or produced by persons, or in schools or workshops, under the supervision of the state department for the visually handicapped or which are performed or produced by nonprofit, sheltered workshops or other nonprofit organizations which offer transitional or supported employment services serving the handicapped. The term "sheltered workshop," for purposes of this subsection means a work-oriented rehabilitative facility with a controlled working environment and individual goals which utilizes work experience and related services for assisting the handicapped person to progress toward normal living and a productive vocational status. 
(2)  Contracts for legal services, expert witnesses, real estate appraisals, and other services associated with pending or contemplated litigation or regulatory proceedings. 
(3)  Any extension of the term of an existing contract for services to allow completion of any work undertaken but not completed during the original term of the contract. 
(4)  Contracts for insurance or electric utility services if purchased through an association of which the town is a member if the association was formed and is maintained for the purpose of promoting the interest and welfare of and developing close relationships with similar public bodies, provided that such association has procured the insurance or electric utility services by use of competitive principles, and provided that the town council has made a determination in advance after reasonable notice to the public and set forth in writing that competitive sealed bidding and competitive negotiation are not fiscally advantageous to the public. The writing shall document the basis for this determination. 
(Code 1992, § 8-107; Ord. No. 99-O-14, § 1(8-107), 4-13-1999; Ord. No. 00-O-31, § 1, 10-10-2000; Ord. No. 04-O-32, § 1, 9-28-2004; Ord. No. 07-O-17, § 5, 5-22-2007; Ord. No. 16-O-34 , § 1, 12-13-2016; Ord. No. 17-O-18 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 30-312. - Procurement transactions. 
    Where applicable, the following provisions, unless specifically excluded, shall be deemed incorporated in every invitation to bid and request for proposal issued by the town and in every contract awarded by the town whether or not specifically appearing or referenced in the invitation to bid, the request for proposal, other solicitation documents or the contract. 
(1)  Contract pricing arrangements. 
a.  Except as otherwise prohibited by this division or by other applicable law, procurement contracts may be awarded by the town on any pricing arrangement appropriate to the procurement and in the best interests of the town. 
b.  Except in case of emergency affecting the public health, safety or welfare, when the procurement cannot be accomplished in a timely manner on other pricing arrangements, the use of a cost plus a percentage of cost contract is prohibited; provided, however, that this prohibition shall not apply to a policy or contract of insurance or prepaid coverage having a premium computed on the basis of claims paid or incurred, plus the insurance carrier's administrative costs and retention stated, in whole or in part, as a percentage of such claims. 
c.  A contract pricing arrangement based in whole or in part upon reimbursement of cost may be used only when a determination is made in writing by the town council that such contract is likely to be less costly to the town than any other type or that it is impracticable to obtain the supply, service or construction item required except under such a contract. Such written determination may be made by the procurement official or officer when the total price of the contract does not or is not expected to exceed $50,000.00 for spot purchases or single year contracts, or $100,000.00 for multi-year term contracts. Such written determination shall be made a part of the contract file. 
(2)  Use of brand names. Unless otherwise provided in the invitation to bid or request for proposals, the name of a certain brand, make or manufacturer does not restrict bidders to the specific brand, make or manufacturer named. It conveys the general style, type, character and quality of the division desired, and any division which the town, in its sole discretion, determines to be the equal of that specified, considering quality, workmanship, economy of operation and suitability for the purpose intended, shall be accepted. 
(3)  Cancellation or rejection of bids; waiver of informalities. 
a.  An invitation to bid, a request for proposals or other solicitation may be cancelled or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part, by the procurement official or officer, when it is determined that it is in the best interests of the town to do so. The reasons for cancellation or rejection shall be made part of the contract file. 
b.  The town has the right in its sole discretion to waive informalities in bids or proposals. 
(4)  Multi-year contract. Unless otherwise provided by law, a contract for goods, services or insurance may be entered into for any period of time deemed to be in the best interest of the town, provided that the term of the contract and conditions of renewal or extension, if any, are included in the solicitation and funds are available for the first fiscal period at the time of contracting. Payment and performance obligations for succeeding fiscal periods shall be subject to the availability and appropriation of funds therefor. When funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available, for any reason, to support continuation of performance of any given contract in a subsequent fiscal period, the contract shall be cancelled and the liability of the town shall be limited to paying for the goods, services or insurance accepted by the town prior to the date of cancellation. The town shall have no liability for lost profits, termination costs or other damages of any sort arising from or related to such cancellation. 
(5)  Contract modification. Town contracts may include provisions for modification of the contracts during performance, but no fixed-price contract may be increased over the life of the contract by amounts totaling more than 20 percent of the amount of the contract or $50,000.00, whichever is less, without the advance, written approval of the town council, except the procurement official or officer may act on contract modifications involving amounts less than $50,000.00.

(6)  Contractual disputes. 
a.  Contractual claims, whether for money or other relief, shall be submitted to the procurement official in writing no later than 60 days after final payment; however, written notice of the contractor's intention to file a claim shall be given at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim is based. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a contract from requiring submission of an invoice for final payment within a certain time after completion and acceptance of the work or acceptance of the goods. Pendency of claims shall not delay payment amounts agreed due in the final payment. 
b.  The town shall include in its contracts a procedure for consideration of contractual claims. Such procedure, may be contained in the contract or may be specifically incorporated into the contract by reference and made available to the contractor. 
c.  The procurement official or officer shall render a final decision on any such claim within 60 days of its submission or within 120 days after final payment, whichever is later. Failure by the procurement official to render a decision shall be deemed a denial of the claim as of the latest date a response was required. 
d.  The decision of the procurement official shall be final and conclusive unless the contractor appeals within six months of the date of the final decision on the claim by the procurement official by invoking administrative procedures in accordance with section 30-316, or in the alternative by instituting legal action as provided in [Code of Virginia,] § 2.2-4364. 
(7)  Public access to procurement information. 
a.  Except as provided in this section, all proceedings, records, contracts and other public records relating to procurement transactions shall be open to the inspection of any citizen, or any interested person, in accordance with the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (Code of Virginia, § 2.1-340 et seq.). 
b.  Cost estimates relating to the proposed procurement transaction prepared by or for the town shall not be open to public inspection. 
c.  Any competitive sealed bidding bidder, upon request, shall be afforded the opportunity to inspect bid records within a reasonable time after the opening of all bids but prior to award, except if the town decides not to accept any of the bids and to reopen the contract. Otherwise, bid records shall be open to public inspection only after award of the contract. 
d.  Any competitive negotiation offeror, upon request, shall be afforded the opportunity to inspect proposal records within a reasonable time after the evaluation and negotiations of proposals are completed but prior to award, except if the town decides not to accept any of the proposals and to reopen the contract. Otherwise, proposal records shall be open to public inspection only after award of the contract. 
e.  Any inspection of procurement transaction records under this section shall be subject, to reasonable restrictions established by the procurement official to ensure the security and integrity of the records. 
f.  Trade secrets or proprietary information submitted by a bidder, offeror or contractor in connection with a procurement transaction shall not be subject to public disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act; however, the bidder, offeror or contractor must invoke the protections of this section prior to or upon submission of the data or other materials, and must identify the data or other materials to be protected, and state the reasons why protection is necessary. 
(8)  Discrimination. In the solicitation or awarding of contracts, the town shall not discriminate because of race, religion, color, sex or national origin of the bidder or offeror. 
(9)  Employment discrimination by contractor. Every contract of over $10,000.00 shall include the following provisions: 
a.  During the performance of the contract, the contractor agrees as follows: 
1.  The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, disability, or any other basis prohibited by state law regarding discrimination in employment, except where religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the contractor. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. 
2.  The contractor, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees, placed by or on behalf of the contractor, will state that such contractor is an equal opportunity employer. 
3.  Notices, advertisements and solicitations placed in accordance with federal law, rule or regulation shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section. 
b.  The contractor shall include the provisions of subsections (9)a.1, 2 and 3 of this section in every subcontract or purchase order of over $10,000.00, so that the provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor.

a.  Bid bonds. Except in cases of emergency, all bids or proposals for non-transportation related construction contracts in excess of $500,000.00 or transportation-related projects authorized under Article 2 [Code of Virginia] § 33.2-208 et seq. of Chapter 2 of Title 33.2 that are in excess of $250,000.00 and partially or wholly funded by the commonwealth shall be accompanied by a bid bond from a surety company, selected by the bidder or offeror, which is authorized to do business in the commonwealth, as a guarantee that if the contract is awarded to such bidder or offeror, that bidder or offeror will enter into the contract for the work mentioned in the bid or proposal. The amount of the bid bond in such cases shall be in the amount equal to five percent of the amount bid. 
1.  A bid bond shall be forfeited to the town as liquidated damages upon the bidder's or offeror's failure to execute a contract awarded to him within seven days of the award or upon the bidder's or offeror's failure to furnish any required performance or payment bonds in connection with a contract awarded to him within seven days of the award unless, and only to the extent that, the seven-day requirement is waived in writing by the procurement official. 
2.  No forfeiture under a bid bond shall exceed the lesser of the difference between the bid for which the bond was written and the next low bid by a responsible bidder, or the face amount of the bid bond. 
3.  At the discretion of the procurement official or officer, bidders or offerors on a construction contract may be required to submit a bid bond in compliance with the foregoing requirements on a bid or proposal anticipated to be less than $500,000.00 for non-transportation-related projects or $250,000.00 for transportation-related projects authorized under Article 2 ([Code of Virginia,] § 33.2-208 et seq.) of Chapter 2 of Title 33.2 and partially or wholly funded by the commonwealth. Such condition and the amount of the bid bond required shall, if applicable, be specified in the invitation to bid or request for proposals.

Except as provided in subsection (10)b.4., upon the award of any construction contract exceeding $500,000.00 awarded to any prime contractor; construction contract exceeding $500,000.00 awarded to any prime contractor requiring the performance of labor or the furnishing of materials for buildings, structures or other improvements to real property owned or leased by the town; construction contract exceeding $500,000.00 in which the performance of labor or the furnishing of materials will be paid with public funds; or transportation-related projects exceeding $350,000.00 that are partially or wholly funded by the commonwealth, the contractor shall furnish to the town the following bonds: 
i.  A performance bond in the sum of the contract amount conditioned upon the faithful performance of the contract in strict conformity with the plans, specifications and conditions of the contract. For transportation-related projects authorized under Article 2 ([Code of Virginia,] § 33.2-208 et seq.) of Chapter 2 of Title 33.2, such bond shall be in a form and amount satisfactory to the town. 
ii.  A payment bond in the sum of the contract amount. Such bond shall be for the protection of claimants who have or fulfill contracts to supply labor or materials to the prime contractor to whom the contract was awarded, or to any subcontractors, in the furtherance of the work provided for in such contract, and shall be conditioned upon the prompt payment for all such material furnished or labor supplied or performed in the furtherance of the work. Labor or material shall include public utility services and reasonable rentals of equipment, but only for periods when the equipment rented is actually used at the site. 
2.  Each of such bonds shall be executed by one or more surety companies selected by the contractor which are legally authorized to do business in the commonwealth. 
3.  At the discretion of the procurement official or officer, the invitation to bid or request for proposals may specify that the successful bidder or offeror will be required to submit a payment or performance bond in compliance with the foregoing requirements on construction contracts for less than $350,000.00. 
4.  The performance and payment bond requirements of subsection (10)b.1. for transportation-related projects that are valued in excess of $250,000.00 but less than $350,000.00 may only be waived by the town if the bidder provides evidence satisfactory to the town that a surety company has declined an application from the contractor for a performance or payment bond. 
c.  Bonds generally. 
1.  Bonds shall be made payable to the Town of Herndon. 
2.  Each of the bonds filed shall be filed with the procurement official, in a form acceptable to the procurement official.

Nothing in this division shall preclude a contractor from requiring each subcontractor to furnish a payment bond with surety thereon in the sum of the full amount of the contract with such subcontractor conditioned upon the payment to all persons who have and fulfill contracts which are directly with the subcontractor for performing labor and furnishing materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the subcontract. 
d.  Alternative forms of security. 
1.  In lieu of a bid, payment or performance bond, a bidder may furnish a certified check, cashier's check, or cash escrow in the face amount, required for the bond. The town is authorized to deposit any such check and to retain the funds represented thereby as the cash escrow. 
2.  If approved by the town attorney, a bidder may furnish a personal bond, property bond, or bank or savings institution's letter of credit on certain designated funds in the face amount required for the bid, payment or performance bond. Approval shall be granted only upon a determination that the alternative form of security proffered affords protection to the town equivalent to a corporate surety's bonds.

e.  Bonds on other than construction contracts. The town may require bid, payment or performance bonds for contracts for goods or services if so specified in the invitation to bid or request for proposals. 
f.  Actions on performance bonds. No action against the surety on a performance bond shall be brought more than one year after completion of the contract, including the expiration of all warranties and guarantees, or discovery of the defect or breach of warranty, if the action is for such defect, or breach of warranty. Any shorter time for commencement of an action or additional notice requirements affecting a right of action on the bond which appear in the bond form shall be void and of no effect.

Notice to the contractor shall be served by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to such contractor at any place where his office is regularly maintained for the transaction of business. Claims for sums, withheld as retainages with respect to labor performed or materials furnished, shall not be subject to the time limitations stated in this subsection.

(11)  Retainage on construction contracts. 
a.  In any town contract for construction which provides for progress payments in installments based upon an estimated percentage of completion, the contractor shall be paid at least 95 percent of the earned sum when payment is due, with not more than five percent being retained to ensure faithful performance of the contract. All amounts withheld may be included in the final payment.

If the contractor elects to use the escrow account procedure, the escrow agreement form included in the bid proposal and contract shall be executed and submitted to the town within 15 calendar days after notification.

g.  Any subcontract for a town project which provides for similar progress payments shall be subject to the provisions of this section. 
(12)  Termination for convenience of the town. The town may terminate performance of any contract, in whole or in part, at any time the procurement official or officer determines such action to be in the town's best interests. Notice of such termination shall be given to the contractor in writing, specifying the extent of the termination and the effective date. Upon receipt of such notice of termination, the contractor shall take all steps necessary to comply therewith.

The debarment shall not be for a period of more than three years, and the notice to the person involved shall state the period for which debarment is proposed. After consultation with the town attorney, the procurement official may suspend a person from consideration for award of contracts if there is probable cause to believe that the person has engaged in any activity which might lead to debarment; provided, however, that if reasonable notice to the person involved and a reasonable opportunity for that person to be heard is not afforded with respect to a decision to suspend by the procurement official, an appeal to the town council shall be given expeditious consideration, and such suspension shall not be for a period exceeding six months. 
(2)  The causes for debarment include:

c.  Conviction under state or federal antitrust statutes arising out of the submission of bids or proposals. 
d.  Violation of contract provisions, as set forth in this subsection (a)(2)d, of a character which is regarded by the procurement official to be so serious as to justify debarment action: 
1.  Failure without good cause to perform in accordance with the specifications or within the time limit provided in a town contract; or 
2.  A recent record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts; provided, however, that failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance, caused by acts beyond the control of or for which the contractor should not be held accountable, shall not be considered to be a basis for debarment. 
e.  Any other cause the procurement official or officer determines to be so serious and compelling as to affect responsibility as a town contractor, including violation of any ethical standards set forth in this division or debarment by another governmental entity. 
f.  A conviction or violation, for the purposes of this section, shall include, in the case of corporations, convictions or violations of any officer or director of the corporation, and in the case of partnerships, convictions or violations of any partner. 
(b)  Decision to debar or suspend. 
(1)  The procurement official shall issue a written decision with regard to any decision to debar or suspend.

The decision of the town council shall be rendered in writing, and shall constitute the final decision of the town. 
(2)  All other decisions of the procurement official or officer shall be considered final decisions of the town except when such decisions are to be made by town council under the provisions of this division. Subject to the provisions of subsection (a)(4) of this section, protest of award, all decisions of the town council shall be considered final decisions of the town. 
(3)  No provision in this division shall be construed as precluding the procurement official or officer from submitting any matter to the town council for decision in the first instance. 
(4)  Protest of award. Any bidder of offeror may protest the award or decision to award a contract by the procurement official or officer or the town council by submitting such protest in writing to the procurement official no later than ten days after public notice of the award or the announcement of the decision to award, whichever occurs first. Public notice of the award or the announcement of the decision to award shall be given in a manner prescribed by the terms and conditions of the invitation for bid or request for proposal. No protest shall lie for a claim that the selected bidder or offeror is not a responsible bidder or offeror. The written protest shall include the basis for the protest and the relief sought.

The town council may decide the matter on the written submission of the protestant and the written response of the procurement official, or, in its sole discretion, request additional written argument, or oral argument at a public meeting of the town council. If the town council for any reason fails to render a decision within the required time, the decision of the procurement official or officer shall be deemed approved and is the town's final decision as of the date the town council decision was due. Such final decision shall be conclusive unless appealed to the county circuit court within 15 days of receipt of the decision. All decisions by the town council on any request for review as set forth in this section shall be rendered within 45 days from the date the request for review was filed with the procurement official. 
(b)  Remedies on appeal. 
(1)  Decisions affecting eligibility. 
a.  If on appeal to the town council or to the courts it is determined that the debarment or suspension of a prospective contractor was arbitrary or capricious, or not in accordance with the law, the sole relief shall be restoration of eligibility. 
b.  Any bidder, offeror or contractor refused permission to participate, or disqualified from participation, in public contracts shall be notified in writing. Prior to the issuance of a written determination of disqualification or ineligibility, the procurement officer shall notify such person in writing of the results of the evaluation, disclose the factual support for the determination, and allow the person an opportunity to inspect any documents which relate to the determination, if so requested by the person within five business days after receipt of the notice. 
c.  Within ten business days after receipt of the notice, such person may submit rebuttal information challenging the evaluation. The procurement officer shall issue its written determination of disqualification or ineligibility based on all information in the possession of the procurement officer, including any rebuttal information, within five business days of the date the procurement officer received or may have received such rebuttal information. 
d.  If the evaluation reveals that the bidder, offeror or contractor should be allowed permission to participate in the public contract, the procurement officer shall cancel the proposed disqualification action. If the evaluation reveals that the bidder should be refused permission to participate, or disqualified from participation, in the public contract, the procurement officer shall so notify the bidder, offeror or contractor. Such notice shall state the basis for the determination, which shall be final unless such person appeals the decision within ten days after receipt of the notice by invoking procedures set out in this section. 
e.  If, upon appeal, it is determined that the action taken was arbitrary or capricious, or not in accordance with the state constitution, statutes or regulations, the sole relief shall be restoration of eligibility. 
(2)  Appeal of denial of withdrawal of bid. 
a.  A final decision by the town denying withdrawal of a bid shall be final and conclusive unless the bidder appeals the decision pursuant to subsection (a)(5) of this section to the county circuit court. 
b.  If no bid bond was posted, a bidder refused withdrawal of a bid, prior to appealing, shall deliver to the town a certified check or cash bond in the amount of the difference between the bid sought to be withdrawn and the next low bid. Such security shall be released only upon a final determination that the bidder was entitled to withdraw the bid. 
c.  If, upon appeal, it is determined that the decision refusing withdrawal of the bid was not an honest exercise of discretion, but rather was arbitrary or capricious or not in accord with the state constitution, applicable state law or regulation, or the terms or conditions of the invitation for bid, the sole relief shall be withdrawal of the bid. 
(3)  Appeal of determination of nonresponsibility. 
a.  Prior to the issuance of a written determination of nonresponsibility, the procurement officer shall notify the apparent low bidder in writing of the results of the evaluation, disclose the factual support for the determination, and allow the apparent low bidder an opportunity to inspect any documents which relate to the determination, if so requested by the bidder within five business days after the receipt of the notice. 
b.  Within ten business days after receipt of the notice, the bidder may submit rebuttal information challenging the evaluation. The procurement officer shall issue his written determination of responsibility based on all information in the possession of the procurement officer, including any rebuttal information, within five business days of the date the procurement officer received such rebuttal information. At the time, the procurement officer shall notify with return receipt requested the bidder in writing of his determination. 
c.  Such notice shall state the basis for the determination, which shall be final unless the bidder appeals the decision to the town council within ten days after receipt of the notice by invoking procedures set out in this section. 
d.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to procurements involving the prequalification of bidders and the rights of any potential bidders under such prequalification to appeal a decision that such bidders are not responsible. 
e.  A bidder contesting a determination that the bidder is not a responsible bidder for a particular contract shall proceed under this subsection (b)(3), and may not protest the award under subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
f.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require the town, when procuring by competitive negotiation, to furnish a statement of the reasons why a particular proposal was not deemed to be the most advantageous. 
g.  If, upon appeal to the circuit court, it is determined that the decision of the town was not an honest exercise of discretion, but rather was arbitrary or capricious or not in accordance with the state constitution, applicable state law or regulation, or the terms of conditions of the invitation to bid, and the award of the contract in question has not been made, the sole relief shall be a finding that the bidder is a responsible bidder for the contract in question or directed award as provided in Code of Virginia, § 11-70A. If it is determined that the decision of the public body was not an honest exercise of discretion, but rather was arbitrary or capricious or not in accordance with the state constitution, applicable state law or regulation, or the terms or conditions of the invitation to bid, and an award of the contract has been made, the relief shall be as set forth in Code of Virginia, § 11-6(B). 
(4)  Protest of award or decision to award. 
a.  A final decision by the town denying a protest of award or of decision to award shall be final and conclusive unless the bidder appeals the decision pursuant to subsection (a)(5) of this section to the county circuit court. 
b.  If prior to an award it is determined that the decision to award is arbitrary or capricious, or otherwise in violation of the law, then the sole relief shall be a finding to that effect. The town shall cancel the proposed award or revise it to comply with the law. If, after an award, it is determined that an award of a contract was arbitrary or capricious, or otherwise in violation of the law, then the sole relief shall be as hereinafter provided. Where the award has been made but performance has not begun, the performance of the contract may be enjoined. Where the award has been made and performance has begun, the town may declare the contract void upon a finding that this action is in the best interest of the public. Where a contract is declared void, the performing contractor shall be compensated for the cost of performance up to the time of such declaration. In no event shall the performing contractor be entitled to lost profits. 
c.  Where the town council, the procurement official, or the court determines, after a hearing held following reasonable notice to all bidder, that there is probable cause to believe that a decision to award was based on fraud or corruption or an act in violation of section 30-317, the town, procurement official or court may enjoin the award of the contract to a particular bidder. 
(5)  Effect of appeal upon contract. Pending final determination of a protest or appeal, the validity of a contract awarded and accepted in good faith in accordance with this division shall not be affected by the fact that a protest or appeal has been filled. 
(6)  Stay of award during protest. An award need not be delayed for the period allowed a bidder or offeror to protest, but in the event of a timely protest, no further action to award the contract will be taken unless there is a written determination by the procurement official that proceeding without delay is necessary to protect the public interest or unless the bid or offer would expire. 
(7)  Legal action. The town adopts the standards of proof and other elements set out in Code of Virginia, § 11-70, with necessary changes, for the conduct of legal actions under this division.

(b)  The town shall ensure that all invitations to bid, requests for proposals, contracts, and purchase orders prominently display a nondiscrimination statement indicating that the town does not discriminate against faith-based organizations. 
(c)  A faith-based organization contracting with the town (i) shall not discriminate against any recipient of goods, services, or disbursements made pursuant to a contract authorized by this section on the basis of the recipient's religion, religious belief, refusal to participate in a religious practice, or on the basis of race, age, color, gender or national origin and (ii) shall be subject to the same rules as other organizations that contract with the town to account for the use of the funds; provided however, if the faith-based organization segregates public funds into separate accounts, only the accounts and programs funded with public funds shall be subject to audit by the town. Nothing in clause (ii) shall be construed to supersede or otherwise override any other applicable state law. 
(d)  Consistent with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, P.L. 104-193, funds provided for expenditure pursuant to contracts with the town shall not be spent for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytizing; however, this prohibition shall not apply to expenditures pursuant to contracts, if any, for the services of chaplains. 
(e)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as barring or prohibiting a faith-based organization from any opportunity to make a bid or proposal or contract on the grounds that the faith-based organization has exercised the right, as expressed in 42 U.S.C. (§ 2000e-1 et seq.), to employ persons of a particular religion. 
(f)  If an individual, who applies for or receives goods, services, or disbursements provided pursuant to a contract between the town and a faith-based organization, objects to the religious character of the faith-based organization from which the individual receives or would receive the goods, services, or disbursements, the town shall offer the individual, within a reasonable period of time after the date of his objection, access to equivalent goods, services, or disbursements from an alternative provider. 
(g)  The town shall provide to each individual who applies for or receives goods, services, or disbursements provided pursuant to a contract between the town and a faith-based organization a notice in bold face type that states: "Neither the town's selection of a charitable or faith-based provider of services nor the expenditure of funds under this contract is an endorsement of the provider's charitable or religious character, practices, or expression. No provider of services may discriminate against you on the basis of religion, a religious belief, or your refusal to actively participate in a religious practice. If you object to a particular provider because of its religious character, you may request assignment to a different provider. If you believe that your rights have been violated, please discuss the complaint with your provider or notify the appropriate person as indicated in this form."

The failure to file a return or to pay a tax due to the death of the taxpayer or a medically determinable physical or mental impairment on the date the return or tax is due shall be presumptive proof of lack of fault on the taxpayer's part, provided the return is filed or the taxes are paid within thirty days of the due date; however, if there is a committee, legal guardian, conservator or other fiduciary handling the individual's affairs, such return shall be filed or such taxes paid within 120 days after the fiduciary qualifies or begins to act on behalf of the taxpayer. Interest on such taxes shall accrue until paid in full. Any such fiduciary shall, on behalf of the taxpayer, by the due date, file any required returns and pay any taxes which come due after the 120-day period. The director shall make determinations of fault relating exclusively to failure to pay a tax, and of fault relating exclusively to failure to file a return.

Sec. 42-135. - Findings.

(2)  The activity of unregulated soliciting employment by occupants of vehicles to pedestrians on highways, sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, or alleys distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch other vehicles or pedestrians and to move through the town with safety. 
(3)  The practice of unregulated soliciting employment from within a highway, sidewalk, driveway, parking area, or alley constitutes a visual blight, inconvenience to workers, and a public nuisance; and subjects the solicitor, pedestrians and vehicle driver to an unacceptable level of danger by distracting drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic; results in the delay and obstruction of the public's free flow of travel, and results in congestion and blockage of the streets, parking area, driveways, and sidewalks. 
(4)  Distracted drivers are more prone to be involved in automobile accidents; and vehicular accidents constitute a substantial public safety problem. 
(5)  The cumulative impact of this type of unregulated solicitation on the highways, sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, or alleys on a daily basis creates a safety hazard and a significant and substantial risk to the interest of the public in the free flow of travel.

Sec. 42-212. - Procedure to designate a residential permit parking zone.

Employees must present this initial statement of grievance within 20 calendar days of the complaint occurrence or knowledge of such occurrence, whichever is later. The immediate supervisor will hear the grievance and respond to the employee within five working days after this initial discussion.

Decisions of the town manager or his or her designee may be appealed to the county circuit court for a hearing on the issue of whether the grievance qualifies for a panel hearing. Proceedings for the review of the decision of the town manager or his designee shall be instituted by the grievant by filing a notice of appeal with the town manager within ten calendar days from the date of receipt of the decision and giving a copy thereof to all other parties.

Sec. 58-21. - Purpose of article. 
(a)  The town council hereby finds that bizarre, garish or otherwise inappropriate exterior design and appearance of buildings, structures and improvements erected in commercial and industrial areas adversely affects the desirability of immediately adjacent and neighboring properties; impairs the benefits of occupancy as to existing properties in such areas; jeopardizes the economic stability and taxable value of businesses, land and buildings in such areas, and in the town as a whole; prevents the optimum use of real estate in the town; induces physical degeneration of property with attendant deterioration of conditions bearing directly on the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens; deprives the town of tax revenue and destroys a proper balance between the taxable value of real property and the cost of municipal services. 
(b)  Therefore, in order to encourage the construction of attractive buildings, to protect and promote the general welfare and to prevent deterioration of the appearance of the town which would tend to create hazards to public health, safety and morals, destroy opportunity for the development of business and industry, and thereby deteriorate taxable land values and commerce below levels necessary to finance acceptable levels of municipal services, it is the purpose of this article to provide for the designation of architectural control districts within land areas zoned for commercial, industrial and public building use, to establish a board of architectural review to regulate the exterior appearance of buildings, structures and improvements proposed for alteration or erection in such districts and to set standards and procedures to be followed by such board and, on appeal from its decision, by the town council.

Sec. 58-77. - Hearing an application. 
    During the consideration of an application filed under this article, the board of architectural review shall hear the testimony of any party desiring to be heard in support of or in opposition to the application. Such testimony shall be strictly confined to the question of whether the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration or restoration satisfies or does not satisfy the criteria for the same set out in this article. The board shall hear any oral testimony that the zoning administrator desires to present.

Sec. 58-78. - Decisions; certificate of approval.

Upon the filing of notice of appeal as provided in this section, the town clerk shall thereupon schedule a public hearing before the town council, not more than 30 days after the filing of such notice; provided, however, that no such hearing shall be had unless and until the town clerk has caused to be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation within the county, at least seven days before such proposed hearing, an advertisement stating the time, date and place of the hearing before the council, the location of the property involved, the name of the applicant and the nature of the building for which approval is sought.

The council may affirm, reverse or modify the decision of the board, in whole or in part, or may remand the case to the board of architectural review. The decision of the council shall be final, subject to the provisions of section 58-81. 
(b)  In determining whether to remand a case to the board of architectural review, the council shall be guided by these factors: the completeness of the record; the appropriateness of the further review by the board of architectural review of certain points or facts; and any amendments to the application after the decision of the board of architectural review. In this regard, the town council recognizes that changes to perfect, clarify, improve or adapt an application to citizen or town concerns, are positive and would not necessarily result in a remand. Changes that are substantive, that do not meet one or more of the elements set out in the preceding sentence, or that preclude complete review of the application by the board of architectural review and citizens at that level, may serve as a basis for remand.

The filing of the petition shall stay the council's decision pending the outcome of the appeal to the court. The court may reverse or modify the decision of the council, in whole or in part, if it finds upon review that the decision of the council is contrary to law, or that its decision is arbitrary and constitutes an abuse of discretion, or it may affirm the decision of the council.

(2)  Whether or not the proposed structure, building or improvement is compatible with existing well-designed structures, acceptable to the board, in the vicinity and in the town as a whole. 
(3)  Whether or not, and to what extent, the proposed structure, building or improvement would promote the general welfare and protect the public health, safety and morals by tending to maintain or augment the town's tax base as a whole, generating business activity, maintaining and creating employment opportunity, preserving historical sites and structures and making the town a more attractive and desirable place in which to live. 
(4)  Whether or not proposed freestanding buildings use the same or architecturally harmonious materials, color, texture and treatment for all exterior walls; and in the case of partially freestanding buildings, whether or not the same or architecturally harmonious materials, color, texture and treatment are used on all portions of all exterior walls exposed to public view. 
(5)  Whether or not the combination of architectural elements proposed for a structure, building or improvement, in terms of design, line, mass, dimension, color, material, texture, lighting, landscaping and roofline and height conform to accepted architectural principles for permanent buildings as contrasted with engineering standards designed to satisfy safety requirements only; and exhibit external characteristics of demonstrated architecture and aesthetic durability. 
(6)  Whether or not, in terms of design, material, texture, color, lighting, landscaping, dimension, line, mass or roof line and height, the proposed structure, building or improvement is designed to serve primarily as an advertisement or commercial display, exhibits exterior characteristics likely to deteriorate rapidly, would be of temporary or short-term architectural or aesthetic acceptability, would be plainly offensive to human sensibilities or would otherwise constitute a reasonable foreseeable detriment to the community.

(a)  While recognizing that the right to assemble is protected by the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and assembly, the town council nevertheless feels obligated to regulate the use of the town lands, parks and recreational areas for meetings and parades in order to protect the correlative constitutional rights of the citizens of the town to sanitary health conditions, safety and general public welfare and in the interest of promoting the free flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
(b)  In order to achieve the purposes listed in subsection (a) of this section, the standards which shall be considered in determining whether written authorization should be given shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(5)  Whether the proposed public meeting or parade will put undue hardship upon available public sanitary facilities and trash disposal facilities.

(7)  Where there is a reasonable threat of violence and/or public damage resulting from the proposed public meeting or parade, the party requesting such authorization shall provide the town with a written plan which reasonably sets forth measures to adequately control and ensure against the anticipated violence and/or property damage. The town may also request a surety bond to pay for repairs caused by any damage. If the foregoing plans and/or bond is found to be satisfactory to the town council or town manager, the proposed authorization may be granted.

Sec. 70-202. - Preliminary subdivision plan. 
(a)  Purpose . A preliminary subdivision plan involving more than 50 lots is reviewed and approved prior to the subdivider's preparation of a final subdivision plat and subdivision site plan. The review process shall be governed by the provisions of the zoning ordinance, Herndon Town Code section 78-202.6(d), site plans that require a public hearing. A subdivision site plan for this purpose constitutes a subdivision plat, not a site plan. For subdivisions involving 50 or fewer lots, the subdivider at the subdivider's option may undergo the preliminary subdivision plat process required for subdivision of more than 50 lots. If the subdivider does not exercise this option, the subdivider shall proceed to the final subdivision plat process. 
After approval of the preliminary subdivision plan by the town council, if necessary (or if not necessary, in any event), the applicant shall submit a final subdivision plat and subdivision site plan for review and consideration prior to site development. The subdivider may submit a final subdivision plat and a subdivision site plan as the preliminary subdivision plan. 
(b)  Phasing. A parcel of land upon which a preliminary plan has been approved may be subdivided in sections, with each section meeting all the requirements of this chapter when considered in conjunction with all previously approved sections. The preliminary plan shall show the sequence and sections of the proposed development. Additional requirements in section 70-204(e), phasing, apply. 
(c)  Standards. A preliminary subdivision plan shall be approved upon a determination by the decision-making authority that the development and uses proposed in the preliminary subdivision plan and its general layout and design comply with: 
(1)  The Herndon Town Code, as may be amended: 
a.  Those standards mentioned in section 1-16 (the town's Public Facilities Manual). 
b.  This chapter (Chapter 70). 
c.  Zoning ordinance, Chapter 78, section 78-401, principal uses; categories and types. 
d.  Zoning ordinance, Chapter 78, Article V: Development Standards. 
e.  All other applicable standards, provisions and regulations of the Town Code. 
(2)  The Herndon Heritage Preservation Handbook, as may be amended. 
(3)  Riparian Buffers Modification and Mitigation Guidance Manual approved by the Chesapeake Bay Local Assistance Board on September 14, 2003, as may be amended. 
(4)  Utility plan requirements of the Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2269, as may be amended. 
(5)  The Herndon Guidelines for the Planning and Design of Town Streetscape Projects (dated November 25, 2008, as may be amended, located in the Herndon Department of Community Development). 
(6)  Any other applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations. 
(7)  Urban Design and Architectural Guidelines for the Herndon Transit-Oriented Core, dated August 23, 2013, by Urban Design Associates including the "List of Proposed Amendments" dated November 5, 2013, revised November 26, 2013. 
(d)  Validation of approved preliminary subdivision plan . Within 90 days of approval by the town council of a preliminary subdivision plan if necessary, the subdivider shall submit five copies of the approved preliminary subdivision plan to the subdivision administrator for validation. The plan shall show all features as approved and shall include a copy of the certified town council resolution approving the plan, if necessary. The subdivision administrator shall review the plan, if applicable, require corrections if necessary, and sign five copies of the correct plan. One signed copy shall be returned to the subdivider. 
(e)  Expiration and revocation. Once a preliminary subdivision plan is approved and validated, it shall be valid for five years from the date of the last recorded final plat, provided the subdivider: 
(1)  Submits a subdivision site plan if required and final subdivision plat for all or a portion of the property within one year of such approval; and 
(2)  Thereafter diligently pursues approval of the subdivision site plan if required and final subdivision plat. Diligent pursuit of approval means that the subdivider responds within 90 calendar days after receipt of town review comments relating to the submitted subdivision site plan and final subdivision plat or modifications thereto. 
Upon 90 days' written notice by certified mail to the subdivider, the town council may revoke such approval upon a specific finding of facts that the subdivider has not diligently pursued approval of the subdivision site plan if required and final subdivision plat. A change in ownership of the property does not affect this time frame. 
(f)  Extension of time. Upon written application submitted by the applicant at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the validity period and upon a showing of good cause, the reviewing authority that approved the preliminary subdivision plan may grant an extension not to exceed six months after the expiration of the validity period. The approval shall be deemed extended until the reviewing authority has acted upon the request for extension.

(2)  Any subdivision site plan or final subdivision plat submitted for the development of the subject property shall be in substantial conformity with proffered statements, plans, profiles, elevations or other demonstrative materials. 
(3)  For the purpose of this section, substantial conformity shall mean that conformity which leaves a reasonable margin for adjustment due to final engineering and site condition data and conforms to the general nature of the development, the specific uses, and the general layout depicted by the proffered plans, profiles, elevations and other demonstrative materials. 
(4)  Once proffered conditions have been approved, and there is cause for an amendment to the conditions because the proposed subdivision is not in substantial conformity with the conditions, then an application shall be filed for a zoning map amendment.

(1)  If the unauthorized connection is an areaway drain a charge of $0.33 1/3 per square foot of the area contributing flow to the areaway drain per month shall be imposed. 
(2)  If the unauthorized connection is one of a downspout, a charge of $0.33 1/3 per square foot of the roof to which the downspout is connected per month shall be imposed. 
(3)  If the unauthorized connection is one of a sump pump connection, a charge of $30.00 per month shall be imposed if the size of the sump pump discharge is less than one inch in diameter and a charge of $45.00 per month shall be imposed if the size of the sump pump discharge is one inch or greater. 
(b)  A full monthly charge shall be imposed upon each unauthorized connection for each calendar month, or any portion of a calendar month, in which the unauthorized connection continues in existence after the expiration of the 30-day period following the issuance of notice of the unauthorized connection by the public works director or his agents. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, an unauthorized connection shall conclusively be deemed to continue until the public works director has been notified by the owners of the premises or the parties responsible for payment for the use of the public sanitary sewer system on the premises, or their representatives, that the unauthorized connection has been terminated. 
(Code 1992, § 21-55) 
Sec. 74-73. - Penalty for failure to disconnect or for reconnection. 
(a)  An owner of premises and any other party responsible for payment for the use on the premises of the public sanitary sewer system who has received actual notice of the existence of an unauthorized connection to the public sanitary sewer system on his premises shall terminate the unauthorized connection prior to the date stated in any written notification as the date by which the unauthorized connection must be terminated. If the unauthorized connection is not terminated within that time period, or if the unauthorized connection is ever reestablished after being once terminated following the receipt of notification of the unauthorized nature of the connection, the following penalty shall be imposed, jointly and severally, upon the owner and any other responsible party: A fine in an amount determined by multiplying the monthly charge that could be imposed under the provisions of section 74-72 for the continued existence of the unauthorized connection by the number of months that the unauthorized connection has been in existence and in which the owner of the premises has been the owner of the premises. The number of months that the unauthorized connection has been in existence shall include even those months in which the connection existed prior to the enactment of this section. There shall be a presumption that any unauthorized connection has been in existence since the date that the initial connection of the premises to the public sanitary sewer system was effected, and this presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the penalty provisions of this section, the public works director shall waive the imposition of any such penalty or fine in any case in which the owner of the premises or any other responsible party has proceeded with due diligence to have the unauthorized connection terminated at the earliest reasonably feasible time.

(Code 1992, § 21-168; Ord. No. 12-O-05, § 1, 1-24-2012) 
Sec. 74-184. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Except as indicated in subsection (b) and (c) of this section, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the director as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Other parameters, as identified in 40 CFR 403, may also require sampling by grab collection. 
(c)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in sections 74-176, 74-177, and 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs sections 74-178 and 40 CFR 403.12(e) and 40 CFR 403.12(h), the town shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

(b)  Upon the connection of a lateral to the public sanitary sewer, the property owner of a parcel which may be served by the connection may request of the public works director of the town that the town not act either to terminate water supply for the use of the real estate or to enforce the lien of the town on the parcel for the payment of the sewer availability fee if the availability fee is not paid when due. The public works director shall have the authority to approve such request if the owner agrees to pay the sewer availability fee in equal monthly installments over a period of no longer than 48 months together with the interest accruing monthly on the unpaid balance, interest to accrue at the rate established by law in the commonwealth, as applicable, if fees, rents or charges charged for the use and services of a sewage disposal system of a town are not paid when due, provided that the director shall first determine that: 
(1)  The request is made in relation to property used as the personal residence of the individual making the request; 
(2)  The individual making the request, and also any spouse from whom the individual is not estranged, is either in necessitous circumstances or is unable to obtain a commercial loan for the financing of the sewer availability fee; and 
(3)  The continued failure of the property to connect with the public sanitary sewer system would create a potential health hazard. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the approval of the director of such a request, upon the transfer and/or sale of the property, the outstanding balance of the sewer availability fee shall be paid in full. 
(d)  The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to unimproved parcels or to those as to which a building permit is being requested.

Sec. 74-396. - Authority of town manager. 
    If a water shortage occurs because of a main break, reservoir leak, pump failure or for any other reason, the town manager is authorized to impose immediate emergency restrictions on water use, notifying the public by radio, television or door-to-door contact of the need for limiting water use during the emergency. 
(Code 1992, § 25-2 (c)) 
Sec. 74-397. - Restrictions on use of water during shortages. 
(a)  The town manager shall have the authority to determine that a water supply emergency exists because water shortages have reached critical and dangerous levels. In that case, the town manager may place an absolute curtailment or restrictions as set forth below on nonessential usage of water. 
(b)  After the town manager has determined that a water supply emergency exists, and after notice has been given to the general public, the town manager is authorized to implement this section for the duration of the water shortage or for a lesser period, in or according to the stages set forth below. 
(c)  In exercising authority granted to him or her by this section, the town manager shall give due consideration to applying water use restrictions or absolute curtailments only to the users of the public water supply system, or elements thereof, which are affected by the water shortage, or which can assist the affected systems in mitigating adverse effects of such shortage. 
(d)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to any governmental activity, institution, business or industry which shall be declared in writing by the town manager to be specifically excepted as necessary for the public health, safety or welfare. 
(e)  The provisions of this subsection set forth the stages and accompanying standards that guide the town manager's absolute curtailment of or restrictions on water usage as set forth above. 
Stage I. When climatic conditions may create a water supply emergency, the town manager is authorized to declare a drought watch and call on the general population to employ prudent restraint in water usage, and to conserve water voluntarily by whatever methods are available. 
Stage II. When the onset of a water supply emergency is imminent, the town manager is authorized to declare a drought warning ordering voluntary or mandatory restricted use or absolute curtailment of non-essential uses of water with the goal of reducing water use by five to ten percent. This means of curtailment may include one or more of the following, among others: 
(1)  Watering of shrubbery, trees, lawns, grass, plants, or any other vegetation, except from a watering can or other container not exceeding three-gallon capacity; or 
(2)  The washing of automobiles, trucks, trailers, or any other type of mobile equipment, excepting in facilities operating with a water re-cycling system approved by the county or the town, or except from a bucket or other container not exceeding three-gallon capacity; provided, however, that any facility operating with a water re-cycling system must prominently display in public view a lawful sign stating that such a re-cycling system is in operation; or 
(3)  The washing of streets, driveways, parking lots, service station aprons, office buildings, exteriors of homes or multi-unit residential buildings, or other outdoor surfaces, except from a bucket or other container not exceeding three-gallon capacity; or 
(4)  The operation of any ornamental fountain or other structure making a similar use of water; or 
(5)  The filling of swimming and/or wading pools or the refilling of swimming or wading pools, which were drained after the effective date of the order; or 
(6)  The operation of any industrial or commercial activity or process, including construction activity, which uses water beyond the sanitary and drinking needs of employees, customers, or visitors; or 
(7)  The use of water from fire hydrants for any purpose other than fire suppression; or 
(8)  The operation of any water-cooled air conditioning which does not have water conserving equipment in operation. 
Stage III. When there exists a water supply emergency, the town manager is authorized to declare a water supply emergency restricting use of water to purposes which are absolutely essential to life, human health and safety, with a goal of reducing water use by ten to fifteen percent. All the limitation described in Stage II may be applied as restriction at this stage of water supply emergency. 
(f)  Any person violating any provision of this section shall be guilty of a class 3 misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine not in excess of $500.00. 
(g)  At any time after the determination that a water supply emergency exists, if the town manager determines that such a condition no longer exists, he or she may declare in writing the rescission of the water supply emergency and the termination of all associated voluntary and mandatory absolute curtailments or restrictions. 
(h)  This section applies to water supplied by the town in the town to the exclusion of any such provision adopted by Fairfax County.

ARTICLE IV. - BILLING PROCEDURE 

Sec. 74-421. - Billing and responsibility for payment. 
(a)  Residential and commercial accounts shall be billed quarterly. For the purpose of timely billing, the town manager may establish separate billing areas when necessary. All accounts are due and payable when rendered. 
(b)  A special meter reading charge of $20.00 is established to cover the cost of reading those meters which require a special trip by the meter reader in order to gain access to the meter to read it for billing purposes. 
(c)  Water customers shall be responsible for and billed for all water delivered through the meter. The meter consumption, as billed, shall not be adjusted unless the meter is malfunctioning, which shall be determined by an accuracy test of the meter. If a meter is shown to be malfunctioning, the customer's account shall be adjusted to reflect the results of the malfunction. The town shall perform one free meter test at the request of the customer. Additional tests requested by the customer will be performed by the town, and the customer will be billed for the actual cost of the tests should the meter be deemed to be functioning satisfactorily. 
(d)  There may be a lien upon real estate for the amount of any fees, rates or other charges arising from water service or sanitary sewer service provided to the property, as provided in section 74-425. 
(e)  Determination of the consumption for the preceding winter quarter billing period will be based on the number of days over which the billing occurred divided into the total consumption and the resulting quotient multiplied by 90 days. 
(f)  Revisions to this article shall be reflected in all bills rendered on and after July 1, 1997, for service on and after that date. Peak use billing shall be based on the consumption of the preceding winter quarter billing period as defined in this article. 
(Code 1992, § 26-7; Ord. No. 12-O-25, § 1, 11-13-2012) 
State Law reference- Lien for service charges, Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2180. 
Sec. 74-422. - Termination of service. 
(a)  All accounts shall become delinquent upon the first day of the second month following the billing date of the bill. In the first incident of a delinquency, the town shall proceed as follows: a delinquent notice will be sent on or about the second working day after the account becomes delinquent. If the delinquent account is not paid by the tenth working day, a door hanger shall be attached to the property providing notice of the service cutoff date if payment is not made. Service will be discontinued not less than 15 days after the due date unless payment has been made in full. Service that has been discontinued will be restored within 24 hours after payment has been received. All delinquent accounts shall be assessed a penalty of ten percent of the total amount due. 
(b)  For delinquent accounts not paid by the date and time noted on the cutoff notice door hanger, a service charge of $20.00 shall be charged to the water customer to cover administrative costs incurred during the service disconnection notification process. In addition a $20.00 service charge for reconnection shall be so charged to cover the cost of terminating and restoring water service for disconnected delinquent accounts. 
(c)  Once the water service has been discontinued because of a delinquent account, it shall be unlawful and shall constitute a class 1 misdemeanor for any person not specifically authorized by the town manager to reconnect to the public water supply. 
(d)  Any appeal of payment of the penalty and cost of restoring water service must be submitted in writing to the director of finance. Based on the facts presented demonstrating that failure to pay was not in any way the fault of the water customer, the director of finance has the authority to determine if the charges should be waived. An appeal of the director's decision may be made to the town council. 
(Code 1992, § 26-8; Ord. No. 12-O-25, § 2, 11-13-2012) 
Sec. 74-423. - Meter readers not to accept payment of bills. 
    Meter readers are prohibited from accepting payment for water bills under any circumstances. 
(Code 1992, § 26-9) 
Sec. 74-424. - Credit for water leaks or high bills of unknown origin. 
(a)  When a water service leak develops either in the underground service line located between the water meter and the structure where the water is used or within the structure itself and the water customer did not by the use of ordinary diligence promptly discover the leak, the town may credit the utility bill of the water customer. The town may issue the credit when the water customer upon discovery promptly and properly repairs the leak, and has not received such a credit during the five years preceding the date of discovery of the water leak. No credit shall be allowed for the period beginning ten days after the date the water customer discovered such leak. The water customer must certify in writing to the town the existence of the water service leak and the date of discovery; and must provide to the town the repair receipt. 
(b)  The town also may issue the credit when the town has a reasonable belief based on documented facts that a leak of unknown origin occurred or is occurring; or when high water and sewer bills of unknown origin occurred or is occurring. The town may only offer the credit described in the last sentence in a case that the same water customer has not received a credit described in this subsection during the five years preceding the date of discovery of the water leak or high water and sewer bills. 
(c)  An adjustment meeting the above standards will be calculated as follows: 
(1)  In the case of an underground leak in the water customer's service line, a credit will be granted equal to 100 percent of the charges for all excess water and sewer usage in the current billing period (or, as applicable, the first or second most recent billing period, or any or all of these periods as determined relevant by the director of finance) in which period the water service leak was discovered and certified to the town to have occurred. 
(2)  In the case of a water service leak inside the water customer's structure, a credit will be granted equal to two-thirds of the charges for all excess water and sewer usage in the current billing period (or, as applicable, the first or second most recent billing period, or any or all of these periods as determined relevant by the director of finance) in which billing period the water service leak was discovered and certified to the town to have occurred. 
(3)  In the case of a water leak of unknown origin or high water and sewer bills of unknown origin that results in charges exceeding five hundred percent above normal water usage, the director of finance may grant a credit computed as follows. This credit shall equal two-thirds of the excessive charges above charges for normal water usage for the impacted water customer. The normal water usage comparison and the resulting credit shall pertain to the current billing period (or, as applicable, the first or second most recent billing period, or any or all of these periods as determined relevant by the director of finance). 
(4)  The director of finance shall determine excess water and sewer usage or normal water and sewer usage using historical data or other recognized standards.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 15-O-16, § 1, adopted May 26, 2015, amended § 74-424 and in so doing changed the title of said section from "Credit for water leaks" to "Credit for water leaks or high bills of unknown origin," as set out herein. 
Sec. 74-425. - Delinquencies and liens. 
(a)  For water and sewer services provided by the town, fees and charges may be charged to and collected from: 
(1)  Any person contracting for the same; 
(2)  The owner who is the occupant of the property or where a single meter serves multiple units; or 
(3)  A lessee or tenant provided that the lessee or tenant has written authorization from the owner of the property to obtain water and sewer services in the name of such lessee or tenant with such fees and charges applicable for water and sewer services. 
    For purposes of this section, a written or electronic authorization from the owner of the property to obtain water and sewer services in the name of such lessee or tenant substantially in the form as follows shall be sufficient compliance with this section:

PROPERTY OWNER 
(b)  If the fees and charges charged for water service or the use and services of the sewage disposal system by or in connection with any real estate are not paid when due, as provided in the next sentence, a penalty and interest shall at that time be owed as provided for by general law, and the owner, lessee or tenant, as the case may be, of such real estate shall, until such fees and charges are paid with such penalty and interest to the date of payment, cease to dispose of sewage or industrial waste originating from or on such real estate by discharge thereof directly or indirectly into the sewage disposal system. If such owner, lessee or tenant does not pay the full amount of charges, penalty and interest for water provided or cease such disposal within 15 calendar days after due date, the town shall cease supplying water and sewage disposal services thereto unless the county health officers certify that shutting off the water will endanger the health of the occupants of the premises or the health of others. 
(c)  Such fees and charges, and any penalty and interest thereon, shall constitute a lien against the property, ranking on a parity with liens for unpaid taxes. There shall be imposed a penalty of ten percent on any delinquent bill for water and sanitary sewer service upon the date of its delinquency. Interest shall accrue on the delinquent amount and penalty at the same rate as prescribed for delinquent real estate taxes. 
(d)  A lien may be placed on the property in the amount of up to three months of delinquent water and sewer charges, any applicable penalties and interest on such delinquent charges, and reasonable attorney fees and other costs of collection not exceeding 20 percent of such delinquent charges. In no case shall a lien for less than $25.00 be placed against the property. In the case of services to a lessee or tenant, if the town does not cease supplying water to the lessee or tenant 60 days after the bill becomes delinquent, unless water is required to be provided pursuant to subsection (b) or other applicable law, there shall be no lien placed on the property for charges and collection costs beyond the 60-day period and no recourse against the property owner for service beyond the 60-day period. 
(e)  A lien may be placed on the property for water and sewer services used by a lessee or tenant only if the town has: 
(1)  Advised the owner of the property in writing that a lien may be placed on the property if the lessee or tenant fails to pay any delinquent water and sewer charges; 
(2)  Mailed by first-class mail to the owner of the property, or sent electronically if requested by the owner, at the address listed in the written authorization from the owner of the property (or such other address as the owner may provide), a duplicate copy of the final bill sent to the lessee or tenant at the time of sending the final bill to such lessee or tenant; 
(3)  Collected a security deposit from the lessee or tenant reasonably determined by the town to be equal to 41/2 months of water and sewer charges as set out in section 74-302(a); 
(4)  Applied the security deposit held by the town to the payment of the outstanding balance; 
(5)  Employed reasonable collection efforts and practices to collect amounts due from a lessee or a tenant including filing for the set-off debt collection program; and 
(6)  Provided the property owner with 30 days' written notice with a copy of the final bill to allow the property owner a reasonable opportunity to pay the amount of any outstanding balance and avoid the recordation of a lien against the property. 
    If the property owner fails to pay the amount of the outstanding balance within the 30-day period, the locality may record a lien in the amount of the outstanding balance against the property owner. Upon payment of the outstanding balance, or any portion thereof, or of any amounts of such fees and charges owed by the former tenant, the property owner shall be entitled to receive any refunds and shall be subrogated against the former tenant in place of the town in the amount paid by the property owner. The town shall execute all documents necessary to perfect such subrogation in favor of the property owner. 
(f)  When the owner has provided the lessee or tenant with written authorization from the owner of the property to obtain water and sewer services in the name of such lessee or tenant, nothing herein shall be construed to authorize the town to require: 
(1)  The owner to put water and sewer services in the name of the owner, except in the case where a single meter serves multiple tenant units; or 
(2)  A security deposit or a guarantee of payment from an owner of property. 
(g)  The town shall not require a security deposit from the lessee or tenant to obtain water and sewer services in the name of such lessee or tenant if such lessee or tenant presents to the town a landlord authorization letter which has attached documentation showing such lessee or tenant receives need-based local, state, or federal rental assistance, and the absence of a security deposit shall not prevent a locality from exercising its lien rights as authorized under subsection (e). Unless a lien has been recorded against the property owner, the town shall not deny service to a new tenant who is requesting service at a particular property address based upon the fact that a former tenant has not paid any outstanding fees and charges charged for the use and services in the name of the former previous tenant. In addition, the town shall provide information relative to a former tenant or current tenant to the property owner upon request of the property owner. If the property owner provides the town a request to be notified of a tenant's delinquent water bill and provides an email address, the town shall send the property owner notice when a tenant's water bill has become 15 days delinquent. 
(h)  The lien on any real estate may be discharged by the payment to the town of the total lien amount and the interest which has accrued to the date of the payment. The town shall deliver a fully executed lien release substantially in the form set forth in this subsection to the person making the payment. The town shall provide the fully executed lien release to the person who made payment within ten business days of such payment if the person who made such payment did not personally appear at the time of such payment. For purposes of this section, a lien release of the water and sewer lien substantially in the form as follows shall be sufficient compliance with this section:

Sec. 78-30.2 - R-10 - Residential single-family district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent . The R-10 district is a zoning district in which the principal use of land is single-family detached residential. The regulations of this district are meant to encourage uses that would substantially complement the development of single-family detached dwellings and that would contribute to the quiet residential nature of the district. The intent of the district is to perpetuate R-10 zoning districts existing prior to the effective date of this chapter and to discourage their consolidation and redevelopment at higher densities when those districts are located on lands designated as Neighborhood Conservation in the Herndon 2030 Comprehensive Plan (adopted August 12, 2008), as may be amended. 
(b)  Density . The maximum permitted density in the R-10 district is 4.4 dwelling units per acre. 
(c)  Principal uses . Table 70-30.2(c)(3), lists uses permitted and allowed in the R-10 district as principal uses. There may be additional regulations in this chapter and in the Herndon Town Code that apply to specific principal uses in the R-10 district.

Sec. 78-40.2. - CS - Commercial services district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent . The CS district provides development opportunities for retail, service commercial, and related uses, as well as to manage commercial development design and vehicular access along major transportation corridors within the town. Recognizing that the zoning map designates two major vehicular gateways into the town as CS districts, CS regulations are intended to help ensure a level and character of quality construction and architecture that impress citizens and visitors with creative design and that promote organizational purpose in the commercial service district. More specifically, the regulations strive to: enhance the appearance and character of development on CS district lands, and ensure its compatibility with surrounding development; coordinate the pedestrian and traffic circulation systems of development on CS district lands with the pedestrian and traffic circulation patterns of surrounding lands; facilitate access between development on CS lands and adjacent lands; and limit the number and control the location of ingress and egress points to CS district lands to encourage and ensure automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience. Zoning map amendments for CS districts requested after the effective date of this chapter shall be confined to those lands designated as CS, or those lands designated as Adaptive Area on the Herndon 2030 Comprehensive Plan (adopted August 12, 2008), as may be amended. 
(b)  Intensity . The maximum floor area ratio permitted in the CS district is .3.

It is the legislative intent of the town council in adopting this chapter to make a constructive transition from zoning provisions existing prior to its adoption to the provisions contained in this chapter, as explained in Article, Introductory Provisions, and in accordance with the following specific provisions. 
(1)  Former PD districts reclassified to newer districts . All lands zoned planned development (residential planned community, planned development housing, planned development shopping center, planned development industrial park, planned development commercial, and planned development mixed use) shall be reclassified according to the town's official zoning map accompanying this chapter. 
(2)  Residential PD district reclassification . Lands zoned residential planned community and planned development housing districts shall be reclassified to planned development-residential upon adoption of the town's official zoning map accompanying this chapter. 
(3)  Nonresidential PD district reclassification . Lands zoned planned development industrial park and planned development shopping center shall be reclassified to planned development-business district upon adoption of the town's official zoning map accompanying this chapter. The reclassification of those lands shall be based on the terms of town council approval (including original or amended proffered conditions and plan(s) of development) for the respective planned development case. 
(4)  Uses allowed as proffered . The allowed uses in planned development districts shall be controlled by proffered conditions and uses permitted in the zoning ordinance at the time of adoption of the specific zoning map amendment. In cases where the zoning administrator determines there is a conflict between the proffered conditions and the uses permitted in the zoning ordinance at the time of adoption of the specific zoning map amendment, the proffered conditions shall prevail. 
(5)  Additional zoning provisions . All other zoning provisions of this chapter shall apply to the reclassified lands except in instances where the zoning administrator determines there is a conflict between this chapter and the terms of town council approval. 
(6)  Alteration . Any alteration to the terms of the ordinance of rezoning that approved a planned development prior to the effective date of this chapter shall cause the alterations, and the planned development where the alterations are located, to be considered as a subject of a zoning map amendment under the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  General intent of planned development district . The planned development (PD) districts are a type of planned unit development district intended to encourage innovative development and redevelopment options. Flexibility of standards enables superior design when planning and site design concepts that conform to community quality of life benchmarks and that achieve high quality development, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency, and other town goals are used. Flexible standards are intended to allow: more choice in providing access, light, open space, and development amenities; more choice in providing a mix of land uses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities; and more ability in taking advantage of special site characteristics and thereby promoting quality development and environmentally sensitive development. 
(c)  Nature of planned development zoning . Planned development zoning may constitute conditional zoning, as authorized by Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2303, involving the proffer of a predetermined plan of development, in return for more flexible development regulations in certain instances. The application, generalized development plan, associated narrative and other statements submitted by the zoning applicant, if accepted by the town council, shall serve as proffered conditions attached to the conditional rezoning. Planned development rezonings generally involve a change to the official zoning map, which change shall be noted on the zoning map. In the case of the planned development transit-oriented core district (PD-TOC), there exists a by-right and special exception element of this zoning classification supplemented by the conditional rezoning elements of the planned district. In the case of the by-right element of the PD-TOC, no further legislative approval is necessary to so utilize this district. 
(d)  Procedures for establishing planned development zoning districts . Procedures to establish a planned development zoning district classification on the official zoning map shall comply with the provisions of Article XV, Decision-making authorities, application review and permitting. 
(e)  Relation of planned development zoning district regulations to general zoning, subdivision or other regulations . The provisions that follow shall apply as may be necessary generally to the initiation, regulation and amendment of the following planned development districts: planned development-business; planned development-commercial; planned development-downtown; planned development-residential; and planned development transit-oriented core if necessary. Where there may be conflicts between the planned development provisions and general zoning, subdivision or other regulations, or requirements, the regulations of this division shall apply in planned development districts unless the town council shall find, in the particular case, that provisions of this section do not serve public purposes to a degree at least equivalent to such general zoning, subdivision, or other regulations or requirements. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017)

The intent of the PD-D district is to encourage revitalization and creative design for residential and commercial lands located in the Downtown Overlay of the Herndon 2030 Comprehensive Plan (adopted August 12, 2008), as may be amended, and to provide flexibility in land planning for residential and commercial development located in the downtown area. 
(1)  Objectives . Objectives of the PD-D district include: 
a.  Promoting harmony in the development of land uses, public spaces and amenities; 
b.  Facilitating mixed use developments and joint development efforts by providing flexibility in determining floor area ratios, height, parking, setbacks and other traditional zoning requirements; 
c.  Encouraging retention and rehabilitation of historical and architecturally significant buildings and structures; 
d.  Promoting a distinctive urban design for the downtown area; and 
e.  Adhering to the standards and guidelines of the Herndon 2030 Comprehensive Plan (adopted August 12, 2008), as may be amended, and the Herndon Heritage Preservation Handbook, revised July 1990, as may be amended from time to time (the Heritage Preservation Handbook). 
(2)  Additional considerations to ensure purpose and intent are met . Decisions on PD-D zoning map amendments shall involve consideration of the existence or provision of an adequate road network and parking facilities, provision of public facilities and amenities, the use or mix of uses offered in proposed development plans, the merit of proposed site design in achieving the goals of the comprehensive plan and the heritage preservation handbook, and the contribution of the proposed development to revitalization of the downtown. The flexibility of PD-D district regulations does not mean that an applicant is entitled to such a rezoning by meeting the minimum requirements of this division or that proposals approaching the maximum permitted density are entitled to a PD-D zoning map amendment. 
(b)  Locations permitted . A PD-D district may only be established by rezoning of lands in the Downtown Overlay in the Herndon 2030 Comprehensive Plan (adopted August 12, 2008), as may be amended.

Comprehensive Plan Amendment #10-01, Downtown Master Plan, adopted February 22, 2011, as amended incorporated by reference shall apply as a general guide to the review of any such development. This area for which this zone may be used corresponds to the downtown as described in section 78-50.3(a). 
(1)  Compliance with downtown master plan . This mixed district is flexible as to the type of land use on a parcel and the exact physical layout of a development; however, proposals must follow the general form of the Downtown Master Plan and the guidelines of the Downtown Pattern Book dated January 29, 2013 by Urban Design Associates, as amended, incorporated by reference. The zoning administrator may make minor and incidental changes or corrections conforming the Downtown Pattern Book to insure full consistency of the Downtown Pattern Book with this chapter. Page 11 of the Downtown Pattern Book is hereby changed to show structures Number 8 in the C-3 preservation priority category. 
(2)  Additional objectives . Other objectives of the PD-TD district are to facilitate mixed use developments and joint development efforts by providing flexibility in determining floor area ratios, height, parking, setbacks and other traditional zoning requirements; to encourage adaptive use of historical and architecturally significant buildings and structures as designated in the historic analysis summary of the Downtown Pattern Book; and to promote a distinctive urban design for the downtown area. 
(3)  Additional considerations to ensure purpose and intent are met . Decisions on PD-TD zoning map amendments shall involve consideration of whether the proposal is fully consistent with the Downtown Master Plan and Downtown Pattern Book and the extent to which provisions are made for adequate public facilities to include enhanced streetscapes, crosswalks, plazas, streets, parking and placement of overhead utilities under the ground. 
(b)  Locations permitted . A PD-TD district may only be established by rezoning of lands in the downtown, as described in section 78-50.3(a). 
(c)  Principal uses . Table 78-50.7(c)(4) lists uses permitted and allowed in the PD-TD district as principal uses.

Sec. 78-60. - Overlay districts. 
    The following sections contain provisions pertaining to overlay districts. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-60.1. - Relationship of standard districts to overlay districts. 
    Lands within the town may be classified into one of the zoning districts set forth in Article III, Residential Districts, Article IV, Business Districts, or Article VI, Planned Development Districts, and also one or more of the overlay districts set forth in this article, Article VI, Overlay Districts. Where land is classified into an overlay district as well as a standard zoning district, the regulations governing development in the overlay district(s) shall serve as supplement to the underlying zoning district provisions. In the event of an express conflict between the standards governing an underlying zoning district and those of one or more overlay districts, the provisions that are more restrictive in protecting the public health and safety shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-60.2. - Floodplain overlay district (FPO). 
(a)  Purpose and intent . This section is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to localities by Virginia Code § 15.2-2280. The town welcomes the dedication of floodplain to the town wherever possible for preservation of the floodplain and its use as green space. The floodplain overlay district (FPO) is intended to: 
(1)  Provide for safety from flood and other dangers; 
(2)  Protect against loss of life, health, or property from flood or other dangers; 
(3)  Prevent disruption of commerce and government services, the unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief; 
(4)  Preserve and protect floodplains in as natural a state as possible for the preservation of wildlife habitats, for the maintenance of the natural integrity and function of the streams, for the protection of water quality, and for the promotion of a zone for ground water recharge; and 
(5)  Prevent the impairment of the tax base by: 
a.  Regulating uses, activities, and development which, alone or in combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities, and frequencies; 
b.  Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development from locating within districts subject to flooding; 
c.  Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur in flood-prone districts to be protected and/or flood-proofed against flooding and flood damage; and 
d.  Protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards. 
(b)  Applicability . The provisions of this section shall apply to all lands within the town identified as flood-prone, as follows: 
(1)  Flood-prone land. Flood-prone land shall not be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered on flood-prone land except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this section and all other relevant chapters and regulations which apply to the development of the land, such as the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, the town subdivision regulations, and applicable state and federal laws. Records of actions associated with administering this section shall be kept on file and maintained by the zoning administrator or designee. 
(2)  100-year flood . The FPO shall include all lands subject to inundation by waters of the 100-year flood. The basis for the delineation of the FPO shall be the flood insurance study for the town prepared by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Insurance Administration, dated February 1979, as may be amended subsequently. The basis for the outermost boundary of the FPO shall be the 100-year flood elevations contained in the flood profiles of the flood insurance study as shown as zone A1-A30 on the accompanying flood insurance rate map, dated April 1, 1979, as amended. Areas designated as either zone A1-A30 or AE shall be that floodplain area for which base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS and FIRM but for which no floodway has been delineated. The delineation of any FPO lands may be revised by the town council where natural or manmade changes have occurred or more detailed studies are conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, another qualified public agency, or qualified individual professionals demonstrating the advisability of such change. Prior to town council's approval of such a change, approval shall be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration. 
(3)  Validity . If any provision of the FPO is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative action or judicial discretion, base underlying floodplain overlay district provisions shall remain applicable. 
(c)  Definitions . See Article XVIII, Definitions, for explanations of words, terms and phrases used in this section. 
(d)  Overlay concept . The floodplain districts described above shall be overlay to the existing underlying zoning districts as shown on the official zoning ordinance map, and as such, the provisions for the floodplain districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions. If there is any conflict between the provisions or requirements of the floodplain district and those of any underlying zoning district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the floodplain district shall apply. In the event any provision concerning a floodplain district is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, the basic underlying zoning provisions shall remain applicable. 
(e)  District boundaries and delineation . The various floodplain districts shall include special flood hazard areas. The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the flood insurance study (FIS) and the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) for Fairfax County and the Town of Herndon prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration, dated September 17, 2010, and any subsequent revisions or amendments thereto, and as described below: 
(1)  Special floodplain area district (AE zone) . The special floodplain area district shall be those areas identified as an AE zone on the maps accompanying the flood insurance study for which 100-year flood elevations have been provided. 
(2)  Approximated floodplain district (A zone) . The approximated floodplain district shall be those areas identified as an A zone on the maps accompanying the flood insurance study. In these zones, no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but the 100-year floodplain boundary has been approximated. 
(3)  Shallow flooding district (AO or AH zone) . The shallow flooding district shall be those areas identified as zone AO or AH on the maps accompanying the flood insurance study. 
(f)  Official map . The boundaries of the special flood hazard and floodplain districts are established as on the flood boundary and floodway map and/or flood insurance rate map which is declared to be a part of this section and which shall be kept on file at the town offices. 
(g)  Administration . The provisions of this section shall be administered as follows: 
(1)  District boundary modifications . The delineation of any of the floodplain districts may be revised by the town where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where detailed studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual documents the need for modification. However, prior to any such modification, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration. 
(2)  Interpretation of the floodplain districts. Interpretations of the boundaries of the floodplain district shall be made by the zoning administrator. Any individual or group disputing a floodplain district boundary interpretation shall have the right to appeal such interpretation to the board of zoning appeals. 
(3)  Submission of technical data . A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the town shall notify the Federal Insurance Administrator of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data. 
(4)  Permit requirement . All uses, activities, and development occurring within any floodplain district shall be undertaken only upon the issuance of a building permit subject to the following provisions.

In addition to the notification requirements described in Article XV, further notification of the proposal shall be given by the applicant to all affected adjacent jurisdictions, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (Floodplain Management Program) and the Federal Insurance Administration. 
(4)  No change in carrying capacity/volume/velocity . Under no circumstances shall any use, activity or development decrease the carrying capacity of, or increase the volume or velocity of inflow to, the channels of floodways of any watercourse, drainage ditch or any other drainage facility or system. 
(5)  No increase in elevation of 100-year flood . No new construction, or development shall be permitted within the floodplain overlay district unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, does not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood at any one point. 
(6)  Alteration and relocation channels/watercourse . Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any channels or of any watercourse, stream, etc., within the town, a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and certification from the Virginia State Water Control Board may be necessary. A joint permit application is available from one of these organizations. Further notification of the proposal shall be given by the applicant to all affected adjacent jurisdictions, the Department of Conservation and Recreation (Floodplain Management Program) and the Federal Insurance Administration. 
(7)  Submission requirements . All applications for development in the floodplain overlay district issued for the floodplain shall comply with the submittal requirements described in section 78-155.3. 
(8)  New construction . The proposed building site must be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following standards: 
a.  Be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, 
b.  Be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, 
c.  Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and 
d.  Be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(9)  Construction standards for enclosed areas below flood elevation . New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the regulatory flood protection level that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below the regulatory flood protection elevation and designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The total net area of all openings must be at least one square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
c.  If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area must have openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit. 
d.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
e.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
f.  Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires openings as outlined above. 
(10)  Elevation standards for residential structures . New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the flood insurance rate map shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated no lower than 18 inches above the base flood level. 
(11)  Elevation standards and floodproofing standards for nonresidential structures . New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within zones A1-30, AE and AH zones on the flood insurance rate map shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated no lower than 18 inches above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level plus one foot the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification, including the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the zoning administrator. 
(12)  Design criteria for utilities and facilities . The following criteria shall apply in the district: 
a.  Utilities . All utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, telecommunication, and water systems being placed in flood-prone areas should be located, elevated (where possible), and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damages. 
b.  Drainage facilities . All drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of stormwater runoff in a safe and efficient manner. The system shall ensure proper drainage along streets, and provide positive drainage away from buildings. The system shall also be designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent properties. The town council may require a primarily underground system to accommodate frequent floods and a secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less-frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local and regional drainage plans. 
c.  Water facilities . All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage and impairment. 
d.  Sanitary facilities . All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems, private package sewage treatment plants, and onsite wastewater treatment systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. In addition, they should be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage and impairment. 
e.  Streets and sidewalks . Streets and sidewalks should be designed to minimize their potential for increasing and aggravating the levels of flood flow. Drainage openings may be required to sufficiently discharge flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights. 
(13)  Modification, alterations, repairs and reconstruction of existing structures . The following standards shall apply in the district: 
a.  Existing structures in the floodplain area shall not be expanded or enlarged unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed expansion would not result in any increase in the base flood elevation. 
b.  In the floodplain overlay district, the modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement that amounts to less than 50 percent of its market value shall conform to the VA USBC. 
c.  The modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement of any kind to a structure and/or use, regardless of its location in a floodplain area to an extent or amount of 50 percent or more of its market value shall be undertaken only in full compliance with this chapter and shall require the entire structure to conform to the VA USBC. 
d.  If the structure in the floodplain overlay district is designed and used as a single-family detached dwelling that is a permitted use in the zoning district pursuant to Table 78-70.2. D: Table of Principal Permitted and Allowed Uses, it may be restored in its location prior to casualty so long as: 
1.  The restoration is begun within 12 months and completed within 24 months of the casualty; 
2.  The modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement is elevated or flood proofed or both to the greatest extent possible; 
3.  The structure occupies the same space it occupied prior to the casualty; and 
4.  No dwelling units are added. 
(14)  Recreational vehicles . Recreational vehicles may be placed on sites for fewer than 180 consecutive days and must be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices. 
(j)  Special floodplain district regulations and map revisions . Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, designated as zones A and AE on the flood insurance rate map, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the town. Development activities in zones A, AE, and AH, on the town's flood insurance rate map which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies with the town's endorsement for a conditional flood insurance rate map revision, and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(k)  Approximated floodplain regulations . The approximated floodplain district shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a 100-year floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown as Zone A on the maps accompanying the flood insurance study. For these areas, the 100-year flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used, when available. It is recommended that the applicant refer to FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas, A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-Year) Flood Elevations." Where the specific 100-year flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, etc., an applicant for a proposed use, development and/or activity greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, shall determine this elevation in accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the zoning administrator. 
(l)  Shallow flooding district regulations . The following standards shall apply in shallow flooding districts. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the flood insurance rate map, above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
1.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the flood insurance rate map, above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade; or 
2.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood-proofed to the specified flood level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
c.  Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be provided to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(m)  Subdivision applications regulations . All subdivision applications within the district shall: 
(1)  Minimize damage . All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  Utilities . All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(3)  Drainage . All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
(4)  Flood elevation . Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development proposals (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that exceed 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(n)  Violations . Violation of district regulations shall be addressed as follows: 
(1)  Penalty for violations . Any person who fails to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of this section or directions of the zoning administrator or any authorized designee of the town pursuant to this section shall be guilty of a civil violation and subject to the penalties in accordance with section 78-170.4(a) of this chapter. 
(2)  Correction of violations . In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved, including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or noncompliance with, this article shall not excuse the violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated in noncompliance with this article may be declared by the town to be a public nuisance and abatable as such. Flood insurance may be withheld from structures constructed in violation of this article. 
(o)  Variances . See section 78-155.4(d)(2), variances in the floodplain overlay district, for regulations governing variances in floodplains. 
(p)  Nonconformities . See Article XVI, Nonconformities, for regulations governing nonconformities in floodplains. 
(q)  Municipal liability . 
(1)  Limitations . The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this section 78-60.2, floodplain overlay district (FPO), is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and the restriction of bridge openings by debris. This section does not imply that areas outside the FPO, or that land uses permitted within those districts, will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
(2)  Personal liability. This section shall not create liability on the part of the town or any officer or employee of the town for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made under this section. 
(r)  Conflict with other regulations . In cases where the requirements of this section conflict with any other provisions of the Herndon Town Code, or state code regulations, the restrictions of this section shall apply in flood-prone districts. 
(s)  Severability . The subsections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this section are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or subsection of this section shall be declared unconstitutional or invalid by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionally or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or subsections of this section. The remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-60.3. - Heritage Preservation Overlay district (HP district). 
(a)  Purpose and intent . The heritage preservation overlay district (HP district) is intended to provide for the establishment of historic landmarks and preservation districts as a means of preserving the historical, cultural, and architectural heritage of the town and protecting designated historic resources and is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to localities by Virginia Code § 15.2-2306. 
(b)  Applicability . No building, structure, or sign located in the HP district shall be erected, reconstructed, altered, demolished, moved, expanded or restored except in accordance with the provisions of section 78-60.3(g), certificate of appropriateness in the heritage preservation overlay district. 
(c)  District boundaries and maps . The boundaries of the HP district shall be shown on the town's official zoning map and on the appropriate comprehensive plan maps after action by the planning commission and town council. 
(d)  Revision of HP district boundary and designation of landmarks . The boundaries of the HP district may be amended or areas, sites, buildings, and structures may be designated as historic landmarks in compliance with the following: 
(1)  Amendment procedures . The procedures for amendment of the HP district boundaries or designation of historic landmarks shall be as provided for as an amendment to the official zoning map pursuant to section 78-155.1, zoning map amendment. In addition, the following procedures shall apply: 
a.  The planning commission shall conduct or delegate a survey of the town. The survey shall identify and inventory all landmarks, buildings, or structures, in areas being proposed within the proposed district boundaries. The planning commission shall also prepare reports recommended to be included in the HP district. 
b.  Prior to establishing or expanding the HP district the town council shall: 
1.  Provide for public input from the community and affected property owners in accordance with Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2204; 
2.  Follow the written criteria set out below to be used to determine which properties should be included within the HP district; and 
3.  Review the inventory and the criteria to determine which properties in the areas being considered for inclusion within the proposed district meet the criteria to be included in the HP district. 
c.  Upon the inclusion of an area in the HP district, the owner of each property within the established district boundaries therein shall be given written notification, including a description of the factors justifying the designation. 
(2)  Review of HP district boundary amendments . The advisability of amending the HP district boundary is a matter committed to the legislative discretion of the town council and is not controlled by any one factor. The following shall be considered by the town council, and its advisory bodies as part of the deliberation process: 
a.  In considering an amendment to HP district boundary, the town council may adopt a change for only part of the area surveyed by the planning commission. The town council may amend the HP district boundary to include any area that has been considered by the planning commission. 
b.  The following criteria shall be used by the historic preservation review board, planning commission, and town council in evaluating the potential expansion of the HP district. The historic preservation review board and planning commission may recommend, and the town council may so ordain, a landmark, building, or structure, for designation as a HP district which meets one or more of the following criteria: 
1.  The property or properties exemplifies or reflects the architectural, cultural, or social heritage of the town, is a reminder of the town's past, and enhances the town's attractiveness to visitors. 
2.  The property or properties are associated with persons of national, state, or local historical significance. 
3.  The property or properties exemplify local or regional architectural design, local craftsmanship or the work of an architect or builder of local, regional, or national prominence. 
4.  The property or properties contain qualities, materials, and other physical characteristics that contribute to the study and understanding of historic periods, styles, or methods of construction. 
5.  The property or properties are closely related to or contiguous with properties that meet criteria a-d as related to their visual character or historic pattern of development; or otherwise contribute to the historic and architectural context of the proposed or existing HP district. 
c.  Such HP district boundaries may be adjusted to exclude properties along the perimeter that do not meet the criteria. The town council shall include only the geographical areas in the HP district where a majority of the properties meet the criteria established below by the town in accordance with this section. However, parcels of land contiguous to arterial streets or highways found by the town council to be significant routes of tourist access to the town or to be designated historic landmarks, buildings, structures, or districts therein, or in a contiguous locality, may be included in the HP district notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection. 
(3)  Review of historic landmark designations . The advisability of designating historic landmarks is a matter committed to the legislative discretion of the town council and is not controlled by any one factor. The following shall be considered by the town council and its advisory bodies as part of the deliberation process: 
a.  In considering whether or not to designate an historic landmark, the town council may designate less than all of the possible landmarks considered by the planning commission. 
b.  The town council may designate any area, site, building, or structure as an historic landmark that has been considered by the planning commission. The designated landmarks shall meet at least two of the following standards: 
1.  The area, building or structure appears on the National Register of Historic Places pursuant to the Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended; 
2.  The area, building or structure is entered upon the Virginia Landmarks Register pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 10.1-138; 
3.  The area, building or structure has been documented as having historic value by the state department of historic resources or another recognized historic or archaeological organization; 
4.  The area, building or structure exemplifies or reflects the architectural, cultural or social heritage of the town, is a reminder of the town's past and enhances the town's attractiveness to visitors; 
5.  The area, building or structure is associated with persons of national, state or local historical significance;

c.  Whether all sites, buildings and structures shall be recognized as products of their own time, with alterations and reconstruction to existing buildings and structures to be consistent with the original style of such buildings and structures. 
d.  Whether or not distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a building or structure or site shall be retained and restored to the greatest extent practicable. 
e.  Whether or not deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired, rather than replaced, wherever reasonably possible, and, if replacement is necessary, whether or not new materials shall match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities to the greatest extent practicable. 
f.  Whether or not repair or replacement of missing architectural features shall, to the greatest extent possible, be based on accurate duplications of the original features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
g.  Whether or not the surface cleaning of buildings and structures constituting historic landmarks shall be undertaken with the gentlest means practicable; provided, however, that sandblasting and other cleaning methods that may damage the existing building materials shall not be approved. 
h.  Whether or not partial demolition of buildings or structures within preservation districts may be approved when one or more of the existing facades are retained for the purpose of integrating new construction into existing historic buildings or structures when such is appropriate and in accordance with the intent of this article. The town does not advocate this procedure, as it goes against the Secretary of the Interior's guidelines for rehabilitation and credits would not be allowed in such projects. 
i.  Whether or not, to the greatest extent practicable, every effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources within or adjacent to the heritage preservation overlay district. 
j.  Whether or not contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing buildings and structures is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the building and structures within preservation districts, and whether or not such alterations and additions would destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material. 
k.

The applicant may request or agree to a continuation of the public hearing in accordance with section 78-152.6, deferral of application and section 78-153.2(i)(2), continuation of public hearing. 
(5)  Certificate of appropriateness for minor improvements . At its discretion, the HPRB may adopt a certificate of appropriateness providing design guidance for certain minor improvements such as changes in color of materials or fences, dumpster enclosures, and similar screening. The staff may review applications for eligible minor improvements addressed in the certificate of appropriateness for compliance with the certificate of appropriateness. The staff shall then notify the applicant in writing whether or not the application successfully complies with the certificate of appropriateness and the improvements shall be authorized under that certificate of appropriateness, without a public hearing before the HPRB. 
(6)  Certificate of appropriateness review standards . Development located within a preservation district shall be completed in accordance with the Herndon Heritage Preservation Handbook and the standards set forth in section 78-60.3(f), development within the heritage preservation overlay district. 
(7)  Appeal of COA decision to town council. The applicant or any person aggrieved by the decision with a property interest in land abutting or across the street from property which is the subject of a final decision of the HPRB on a certificate of appropriateness, may appeal the decision to the town council, as follows. 
a.  An appeal shall be initiated by filing a written notice of appeal with the zoning administrator specifying the grounds for the appeal within 14 days of the final decision of the HPRB. 
b.  No action shall be taken until 15 days after the final decision of the HPRB on a certificate of appropriateness. If a written notice of appeal on a certificate of appropriateness is initiated pursuant to this section, action on the certificate of appropriateness shall be stayed pending the final decision by town council. 
c.  The zoning administrator shall schedule a hearing on the matter at the earliest feasible town council meeting by which time notice can be provided consistent with the requirements of section 78-153.2(h), public notification. 
d.  At the hearing on the appeal, the appellant or the appellant's agent shall state the grounds for the appeal and identify any materials or evidence from the record to support the appeal. Town staff shall be given an opportunity to respond, as shall any other person(s) the council deems necessary and appropriate. 
e.  After the conclusion of the hearing, the town council may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the HPRB, in whole or in part, or may remand the case to the HPRB. The decision shall be based on the standards in section 78-60(f), development within the Historic Preservation Overlay District. The town council decision shall be subject to the following standards: 
1.  A decision shall not be reversed or modified unless there is evidence in the record that the decision of the HPRB is not correct, based on the review standards for a certificate of appropriateness. 
2.  In determining whether or not to remand a case to the HPRB, the town council shall be guided by the following factors: the completeness of the record; the appropriateness of further review by the HPRB of certain points or facts; and any amendments to the application after the decision of the HPRB. Town council recognizes that revisions to an application for the purpose of clarifying issues, or addressing concerns raised during the public hearing are positive and will not necessarily result in a remand, except that significant and substantive revisions to the application may serve as a basis for remand. 
(8)  Appeal of town council decision to circuit court . The applicant, any person jointly or severally aggrieved with a property interest in land abutting or across the street from property which is the subject of a final decision of the town council pursuant to subsection (7) above, any person with a property interest in land in the Heritage Preservation District, who is aggrieved by a final decision of the town council, pursuant to subsection (7) above, or the town, may appeal the decision to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County pursuant to Code of Virginia § 15.2-2306. If appealed, a petition at law shall be filed setting forth the alleged illegality of the action by the town council, provided that such petition shall be filed within 30 days after the final decision is rendered by the town council. The filing of the petition shall stay the decision of the town council pending the outcome of the appeal to the court, except that the filing of the petition shall not stay a decision of the town council denying the right to raze or demolish a historic landmark, building or structure.

(Ord. No. 18-O-29 , § 1, 11-13-2018) 
Sec. 78-60.4. - Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay district (CBPAO). 
(a)  Purpose and intent . The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area (CBPAO) overlay district is established under the authority provided in Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2280, and following, and to implement the requirements of Code of Virginia, § 62.1-44.15:67 et seq., and to: 
(1)  Implement the objectives for the environment described in the comprehensive plan; 
(2)  Protect existing high-quality state waters and protect surface groundwater; 
(3)  Restore all other state waters to a condition or quality that will permit all reasonable public uses and supports the propagation and growth of all aquatic life within a balanced ecosystem; 
(4)  Safeguard the clean waters of the commonwealth from pollution; 
(5)  Prevent increase of nonpoint pollution; 
(6)  Reduce existing nonpoint source pollution; and 
(7)  Promote water resource conservation to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the present and future residents of the town. 
(b)  Findings . The following statements describe the significance of the Chesapeake Bay to the town: 
(1)  The Chesapeake Bay, with its tributaries, is one of the most important and productive estuarine systems in the country, providing economic and social benefits to the citizens of the town. 
(2)  The Chesapeake Bay waters have been degraded significantly by many sources of pollution including nonpoint source pollution from land uses and development. The lands within the town are valuable in assisting the preservation of the bay. Some display intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological processes they perform and also display ecological benefits by providing water quality maintenance and flood and erosion control. Only with proper management can development and use occur without damage to Chesapeake Bay waters. 
(3)  The lands designated by the town council as Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas are those lands which, due to the degradation of bay waters and the passage of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act, need to be protected from destruction and damage through improper development and use practices to protect the quality of bay waters. 
(c)  Applicability . The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay district shall apply to all land in Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas (CBPAs,) which shall include land that meets the designation criteria in section 70-60.4(f) and shall therefore be subject to the provisions of section 78-60.4. 
(d)  Definitions . Words, terms and phrases used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in Article XVIII, Definitions. 
(e)  Overlay concept . These CBPA district regulations shall apply in addition to all other underlying zoning districts. Any parcel of land subject to the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay district (CPBAOD) shall also be subject to the provisions of one or more of the other zoning districts established by this chapter. Unless otherwise provided, the approval procedures in this chapter and the Town Code shall be utilized in the review of applications governed by this section. 
(f)  Designation of Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas . CBPAs are divided into resource protection areas (RPAs), resource management areas (RMAs), as well as intensely developed areas (IDAs) and they are subject to the use restrictions and regulations in this chapter. 
(1)  Resource protection area (RPA) . RPAs shall consist of sensitive lands adjacent to water bodies with perennial flow that have either an intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological or biological process they perform or that are sensitive to land uses or activities such that the use may result in significant degradation to state waters. In their natural condition, these lands provide for the removal, reduction or assimilation of nonpoint source pollution entering the bay and its tributaries. The RPA shall consist of: 
a.  Nontidal wetlands connected by surface flow and contiguous to water bodies with perennial flow; and 
b.  A buffer area not less than 100 feet in width that is (i) along each side of any water body with perennial flow and (ii) located adjacent to and landward of nontidal wetlands as described in a. above; 
c.  The full buffer area shall be designated as the landward component of the RPA notwithstanding the presence of permitted uses, encroachments, and permitted vegetation clearing in compliance with sections 78-60.4, 78-60.4(l) and 78-60.4(m); and 
d.  The buffer is to be measured from the top of bank or ordinary high-water mark landward 100 feet. 
(2)  Resource management area (RMA) . The RMA shall consist of all land located in the Town of Herndon that is not included in the RPA or in the IDA. Resource management areas protect the quality of state waters, are deemed to be lands of significance for the protection of the environment, and incorporate, but are not limited to, floodplains, highly erodible soils, steep slopes of 15 degrees or greater and nontidal wetlands not connected by surface flow to water bodies with perennial flow. 
(3)  Intensely developed area (IDA) . The intensely developed area (IDA) delineates development and infill sites as of October 23, 1990 (the date of original adoption of regulations for Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas) where development was concentrated and little of the natural environment remains. The IDA shall comply with section 78-60.4(l)(7). 
(g)  District boundaries and map . The boundaries of the Chesapeake preservation area overlay district are mapped and incorporated by reference into the zoning ordinance as follows: 
(1)  Mapped areas (general) . The designations identified in section 78-60.4(f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3) are delineated on the "Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas" map, adopted by the town council on February 10, 2004, as amended, incorporated by reference. Data from the perennial stream mapping project conducted by the Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services and completed November 2003 was used to determine Herndon's perennial streams and the associated 100-foot RPA buffer. 
(2)  Detailed mapping . The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas map shows only the general location of CBPAs. Persons contemplating land development within the Town of Herndon should consult this map prior to these activities. The specific location of RPAs on a lot or parcel shall be delineated on each site or parcel as required under section 78-60.4(h) site-specific delineation for RPAs or through the review and approval of a water quality impact assessment, as provided for in section 78-60.4(n). 
(h)  Site-specific delineation for resource protection areas . As part of any land disturbance, development or redevelopment on a parcel that contains RPA, a site-specific RPA delineation shall be required. The "Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas" map, adopted by the town council on February 10, 2004, as amended, may be used as a guide to identify the general location of resource protection areas. 
(1)  Land disturbance of less than 5,000 square feet in RPA . For land disturbance in the RPA that is no more than 5,000 square feet, the site-specific RPA delineation shall include a scaled property drawing that is prepared by the owner or the owner's agent and verified by the community forester and that: 
a.  Delineates nontidal wetlands connected by surface flow and contiguous to water bodies with perennial flow; 
b.  Delineates a 100-foot buffer area that is shown (i) along each side of any water body with perennial flow and (ii) adjacent to and landward of nontidal wetlands as described in a. above; and 
c.  Identifies other sensitive environmental features, as determined by the zoning administrator. 
(2)  Land disturbance of more than 5,000 square feet in RPA . For land disturbance in the RPA that exceeds 5,000 square feet, the following requirements shall be met: 
a.  RPA boundary delineation studies shall be sealed by a professional engineer, land surveyor, landscape architect, soil scientist or wetland delineator certified or licensed to practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Any work performed by other firms or individuals not under the responsible charge of the licensed professional sealing the study shall be identified and sealed by that individual, as appropriate; 
b.  Wetland determinations used in the RPA delineation shall be performed using methods specified by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and a copy of the USACE's Jurisdictional Determination approving the wetlands delineation shall be provided; 
c.  RPA boundary delineation studies shall be submitted on standard-size sheets of 243× 363 at a scale of 13 = 502 or larger; and 
d.  Site-specific RPA delineation shall include the following: 
1.  Cover sheet with project name, town plan identification number, vicinity map, tax map reference number and fee computation; 
2.  A narrative describing how the proposed RPA boundary was established, including a discussion of which components determine this RPA boundary, and any wetlands shown on the plan(s) that were determined not to be a component of the RPA; 
3.  Plan sheet(s) with two-foot contour interval topography showing each individual component of the RPA overlain to create the final RPA boundary, the RPA boundary from the adopted Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area map, locations of the horizontal and vertical control points, and locations of points and transects used in the wetland determination. Topography shall be correlated to a USGS or Town benchmark(s), based on NGVD29, which shall be referenced in the plan. Plan sheets shall include a north arrow. 
4.  Standard USACE data forms used in the wetland determination and the issued jurisdictional determination for the subject site. 
5.  A description of the methodology used and data collected, including standard data sheets, used to identify water bodies with perennial flow. 
e.  In determining the site-specific RPA boundary, the zoning administrator may adjust the applicant's submittal utilizing the "Federal Manual for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands," 1987, for determining wetlands location. In the event the applicant contests the adjusted boundary, the applicant may appeal the zoning administrator's decision, under section 78-150.6(f), appeal of zoning administrator decision or determinations by the zoning administrator. 
(i)  Subdivision plat . Each subdivision plat shall note the existence of any RMA or RPA areas on the land shown on such plat. The existence of RMA or RPA on a lot created prior to the adoption of this article shall not be the basis for the granting of a CBPA exception. 
(j)  Permitted uses in Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas . The following provisions shall apply to uses within the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas: 
(1)  RMA uses . A use shall be permitted within the RMA provided it is permitted in the underlying zoning district regulations and it complies with the performance criteria set forth in section 78-60.4(l) general performance criteria for land disturbance in Chesapeake Bay protection areas.

(5)  Water quality impact assessment required . A water quality impact assessment, pursuant to section 78-60-4(n), shall be required for the following: 
a.  Any proposed land disturbance, development or redevelopment activity within a RPA, including the expansion of nonconforming structures and uses, as identified in section 78-60.4(o); or 
b.  Any development within the RMA, as deemed necessary by the zoning administrator, based upon the unique characteristics of the site or intensity of the proposed use(s) or development. 
(6)  Evidence of required permits . The developer shall provide evidence to the town, prior to commencing grading or other on-site land disturbing activities, that any wetlands or similar permit required by federal, Virginia or local laws or regulations have been properly obtained. 
(7)  Development in IDA . If the development is located within the IDA: 
a.  Vegetation shall be provided to the extent possible to assist in re-establishing vegetation within a 100-foot wide buffer area along any streams on the site or adjacent to the site in order to maximize water quality protection, pollutant removal and water resource conservation. 
b.  The zoning administrator may waive the requirement for the re-establishment of vegetation within the RPA buffer within the IDA, in accordance with section 78-60.4(p), administrative waivers of requirements for CBPAs (RMAs and RPAs). 
(m)  Additional development criteria for resource protection areas . The following additional criteria shall apply to development in the RPA. 
(1)  100-foot buffer . Establishment of a 100-foot buffer area is required, and it shall be the landward component of the RPA as set forth in section 78-60.4(f)(1). Notwithstanding permitted uses, encroachments, and vegetation clearing, as set forth in this section, the 100-foot buffer shall not be reduced in width. In addition, the following criteria apply: 
a.  To minimize the adverse effects of human activities on the other components of the RPA, state waters and aquatic life, this 100-foot wide buffer that is effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff shall be retained if present, established where it does not exist, and adequately maintained thereafter. This 100-foot wide buffer is the same one referred to in (1) above; and 
b.  The 100-foot buffer area, as described in (1) above, shall be deemed to achieve a 75 percent reduction in sediments and 40 percent reduction in nutrients. 
c.  The 100-foot RPA buffer may be encroached upon under the following circumstances: 
1.  If the requirements result in the loss of a buildable area for new homes or new principal structures on lots recorded before October 1, 1989, the zoning administrator may grant encroachments into the buffer area provided that: 
(a)  The applicant submits an administrative waiver application, in accord with section 78-60.4(p)(1) and the required water quality impact assessment (WQIA), receives zoning administrator approval; 
(b)  The encroachment into the buffer area shall be the minimum necessary to achieve a reasonable buildable area for a principal structure and necessary utilities; 
(c)  Where practical, a vegetated area that maximizes water quality protection, mitigates the effects of the buffer encroachment, and equals the area of the buffer encroachment shall be established elsewhere on the lot; and 
(d)  The encroachment may not extend into the buffer area that is 50 feet closest to the water body with perennial flow and/or its associated wetlands. 
2.  If the requirements result in the loss of a buildable area for new homes or new principal structures on lots recorded between October 1, 1989, and February 10, 2004, the zoning administrator may grant an encroachment into the buffer area provided that: 
(a)  The lot or parcel was created as a result of a process conducted in conformity with Chapter 70, Subdivision of Land, of the Town of Herndon Code; 
(b)  Conditions or mitigation measures imposed through a previously approved exception shall be met; 
(c)  If the use of a best management practice was previously required, the BMP shall be evaluated to determine if it continues to function effectively and, if necessary, the BMP shall be reestablished or repaired and maintained as required; and 
(d)  The criteria in section 78-60.4(m)(1)c.1. shall be met. 
(2)  Buffer area management . To maintain the functional value of the buffer area, indigenous vegetation may be removed, if approved by the zoning administrator, to provide for reasonable sight lines, access paths, general woodlot management, and BMPs, including BMPs that prevent upland erosion and concentrated flows of stormwater, as follows: 
a.  Trees may be pruned or removed only as necessary to provide for sight lines and vistas, provided that, where removed, they shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff; 
b.  Any path shall be constructed and surfaced to control erosion effectively; 
c.  Dead, diseased or dying trees or shrubbery and noxious weeds may be removed and thinning of trees may be allowed pursuant to sound horticulture practice as prescribed by the town's community forester; and 
d.  For stream restoration projects, trees and woody vegetation may be removed, necessary control techniques employed, and appropriate vegetation established to protect or stabilize the stream in accordance with the best available technical advice and applicable permit conditions or requirements. 
e.  Use of fertilizers, herbicides or pesticides shall be minimized in the buffer area. 
(3)  Water dependent development . For new or expanded water-dependent development, the applicant shall demonstrate that the regulated activity meets or exceeds the following standards: 
a.  All performance criteria set forth in this article; 
b.  Any non-water dependent component is located outside of the RPA; 
c.  Access is provided with the minimum disturbance necessary and where possible, with a single point of access; and 
d.  The development does not conflict with the comprehensive plan. 
(4)  Roads and driveways . Roads and driveways not exempt under section 78-60.4(k) and which, therefore, must comply with the provisions of this article, may be constructed in or across RPAs if each of the following conditions is met: 
a.  The zoning administrator makes a finding that there are no reasonable alternatives to aligning the road or driveway in or across the RPA;

g.  It is not the intent of this section to allow a stormwater management or BMP facility that serves a single development, an individual lot, or some portion of the lot to be located within a RPA. To locate such a facility in the RPA, the town council must grant an exception, as provided for in section 78-60.4(p). 
(n)  Water quality impact assessment requirements . A water quality impact assessment shall be required and submitted for any proposed land disturbance, development or redevelopment activity within the RPA as follows. 
(1)  Requirement standards . A water quality impact assessment shall be required for the following: 
a.  Any proposed land disturbance, development or redevelopment activity within a RPA, as permitted and consistent with sections 78-60.4(j) and 78-60.4(l); 
b.  Any proposed development in the RMA that, in the judgment of the zoning administrator, warrants such an assessment because of the unique characteristics of the site or intensity of the proposed use, or development; and 
c.  As a part of an application for a rezoning, a special exception, a site plan, a preliminary plan or a single lot development plan that meets the criteria in items a. and b. above. The zoning administrator has the authority to approve or deny a water quality impact assessment. 
(2)  Purpose . The purpose of the water quality impact assessment is to: 
a.  Identify the impacts of the proposed land disturbance, development or redevelopment on water quality and lands within the RPAs and other environmentally sensitive lands; 
b.  Ensure that, where land disturbance, development or redevelopment takes place within RPAs and other sensitive lands, it is located on those portions of a site and in a manner, that is least disruptive to the natural functions of RPAs and other sensitive lands; 
c.  Protect individuals from investing funds for improvements proposed for location on lands unsuited for such development because of high groundwater, erosion, vulnerability to flood and storm damage; and 
d.  Specify mitigation that addresses water quality protection. 
(3)  Minor water quality impact assessments . A minor water quality impact assessment pertains only to any land disturbance, development or redevelopment in the RPA which (i) causes up to 5,000 square feet of land disturbance, or (ii) is located in the RMA and is determined by the zoning administrator to warrant such assessment under section 78-60.4(l)(6). A minor water quality impact assessment shall meet the following standards. 
a.  A minor assessment must demonstrate that the undisturbed buffer area, together with the enhanced vegetative plantings and any required BMP, retards runoff, prevents erosion, and filters non-point source pollution to the equivalent of the full undisturbed 100-foot buffer area, which shall be deemed to achieve a 75 percent reduction in sediments and a 40 percent reduction in nutrients. 
b.  A minor assessment shall include a drawing to scale that shows the following: 
1.  Location of the components of the CBPA including the 100-foot buffer area component of the RPA; 
2.  Location and nature of the proposed encroachment into the buffer area including type of paving material; areas of clearing or grading; location of any structures, drives, or other impervious surfaces; and existing private water supply systems or sewage disposal systems to include reserve drain field sites; 
3.  Type and location of proposed BMPs, if necessary, to mitigate the proposed encroachment; 
4.  Location of existing, on-site vegetation, including the number and type of trees and other vegetation, to be removed in the buffer to accommodate the encroachment or alteration; and 
5.  Re-vegetation plan that supplements the existing buffer vegetation in a manner that provides for pollutant removal as well as erosion and runoff control, in accordance with the Riparian Buffers Modification and Mitigation Guidance Manual, approved by Chesapeake Bay Local Assistance Board on September 15, 2003. 
(4)  Major water quality impact assessments . A major water quality impact assessment shall be required for any land disturbance, development or redevelopment in the RPA which (i) exceeds 5,000 square feet of land disturbance or (ii) is located in an RMA and is determined by the zoning administrator to warrant a water quality impact assessment under section 78-60.4(l)(6). A major water quality impact assessment shall meet the following standards. 
a.  The information for this assessment shall be considered a minimum, unless the zoning administrator determines that some of the elements are unnecessary due to the scope and nature of the proposed use(s) and land development. 
b.  The following elements shall be included in the preparation and submission of a major water quality assessment: 
1.  All of the information required in a minor water quality impact assessment, as specified in paragraph section 78-60.4(n)(3)a. of this section. 
2.  A hydrogeological component that: 
(a)  Describes the existing topography, soils, hydrology and geology of the site and adjacent lands; 
(b)  Describes the impacts of the proposed development on topography, soils, hydrology and geology on the site and adjacent lands; and

vii.  Anticipated duration and phasing schedule or construction project; and 
viii.  Acquisition of all requisite permits from all applicable agencies necessary to develop the project. 
3.  Describes the proposed mitigation measures for the potential hydro geological impacts. Potential mitigation measures include: 
(a)  Proposed erosion and sediment control concepts; concepts may include minimizing the extent of the cleared area, perimeter controls, reduction of runoff velocities, measures to stabilize disturbed areas, schedule and personnel for site inspection; 
(b)  Proposed stormwater management system; 
(c)  Creation of wetlands to replace those lost; and 
(d)  Minimizing cut and fill. 
4.  Identification of the existing characteristics and conditions of sensitive lands included as components of Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas, as defined in this article. 
5.  Identification of the natural processes and ecological relationships inherent in the portion of the CBPA located on the site and an assessment on the impact of the proposed use and development on these processes and relationships. 
(5)  Water quality impact assessment submission and review requirements . The submission and review requirements shall meet the following standards:

(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
ARTICLE VII. - USE REGULATIONS 

Sec. 78-70. - Principal permitted and allowed uses. 
    The following sections contain provisions pertaining to principal uses. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-70.1. - Principal permitted and allowed uses, generally. 
(a)  Purpose and intent . Land uses are organized into groups called "use categories" which list specific "use types." Use categories are described in section 78-71. Standards are provided in this article for both "use categories" and "use types". Additional standards throughout this chapter may apply, such as in Article II, Zoning Districts, Article V, Development Standards, or Article XIII, Performance Standards. 
(b)  Additional use specific standards . Regardless of whether a use category is permitted by right, permitted as a special exception, or allowed in a planned development, there may be additional regulations that are applicable to a specific use. Within this article is section 78-71, use categories: principal use categories, characteristics and types, and section 78-21, which applies to all zoning districts unless otherwise specified. Other standards appear elsewhere in Article VIII for Accessory Uses, Article IX, Temporary Uses and Structures, in Article XV for procedures for application approval, the dimensional standards for each zoning district and, Article XI, Development Standards, and perhaps other sections of the Herndon Town Code. It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that all published rules, regulations, and standards have been captured in any application submitted for approval. 
(c)  Developments with multiple principal uses . When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be in the category of personal services and retail sales category because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to applicable regulations within that category. Developments with multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall incorporate only those uses permitted in the underlying zoning district. 
(d)  Number of primary or principal structures per lot . There shall be no more than one primary or principal structure, plus permitted accessory structures, per lot or tract of land, except in the multi-family, planned development or business districts subject to the provisions of this chapter. To qualify as part of a single primary structure, a structure must be structurally linked to the rest of the primary structure. 
(e)  Prohibited uses . Certain uses shall be prohibited as follows: 
(1)  Uses not specifically allowed . A use not specifically allowed in this chapter is prohibited, except in accord with section 78-70.1(f), unlisted uses. 
(2)  Donation drop-off boxes . Donation drop-off boxes exist informally in the town on July 1, 2013 and later. These donation drop-off boxes constitute buildings and uses and are subject to zoning regulation under Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2280. The town has not approved the location and existence of any donation drop-off box in the town; and so, these donations drop-off boxes constitute zoning violations. The town council ordains that donation drop-off boxes are not buildings or uses that the town council through legislation, or the zoning administrator through administrative order or determination, has, does, or will allow. The town council orders the town manager or zoning administrator, or both, to cause the existing donation drop-off boxes to be removed from the town on and after July 1, 2014, except where such course be prohibited by law of the United States of America. To this end, these officials may employ the powers and remedies set forth in under Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2286, and section 78-200.6 of this chapter. 
(f)  Unlisted uses . Where a particular use type is not specifically listed in a zoning district or in Table 78-70.2(d), Table of Principal Permitted and Allowed Uses, and not otherwise prohibited, the zoning administrator will evaluate the unlisted use in accordance this section. 
(1)  Request treated as interpretation . The request to review an unlisted use shall be treated as an interpretation pursuant to section 78-150.6(e), determination requests. 
(2)  Review . The zoning administrator shall give due consideration to the intent of this chapter concerning the zoning district(s) involved, the character of the uses specifically identified, and the character of the use(s) in question and may permit the use type upon finding the standards of section 78-70.1(f)(5), standards for approving unlisted uses, are met. Based on these considerations, the zoning administrator may alternatively find that the proposed use is not permitted in any district. 
(3)  Listed uses may not be permitted in another district by interpretation . Where a particular use is specifically listed in the text of at least one zoning district and indicated as a permitted or allowed use in Table 78-70.2(d), Table of Principal Permitted and Allowed Uses, and the use is not otherwise prohibited, but is not listed in the text of any other zoning district or indicated as a permitted or allowed use in any other district on Table 78-70.2(d), the use is considered specifically prohibited in the other district(s), and the zoning administrator may not permit the use. 
(4)  Effect of determination by the zoning administrator . In making a determination whether or not to approve an unlisted use, the zoning administrator's determination shall be binding on all officers, employees and departments of the town. 
(5)  Standards for approving unlisted uses . To determine that the proposed use(s) has an impact that is similar in nature, function, and duration to the other listed use types permitted in a specific zoning district, the zoning administrator shall assess all relevant characteristics of the proposed use, including but not limited to the following: 
a.  Sales type . The volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale; size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the premises; 
b.  Processing . Any processing done on the premises, including assembly, manufacturing, warehousing, shipping, distribution; any dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the processing; 
c.  Storage and display . The nature and location of storage and outdoor display of merchandise; enclosed, open, inside, or outside the principal building; and predominant types of items stored (such as business vehicles, work-in-process, inventory, and merchandise, construction materials, scrap and junk, and raw materials including liquids and powders); 
d.  Similar uses . The type, size, and nature of buildings and structures normally occupied by the use or by similar uses; 
e.  Employees and customers . The number and density of employees and customers per unit area of site in relation to business hours and employment shifts; 
f.  Transportation requirements . Transportation requirements, including the modal split for autos and freight, by volume type and characteristic of traffic generation to and from the site, trip purposes and whether trip purposes can be shared by other use types on the site; 
g.  Parking requirements . Parking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the number of spaces required per unit area or activity, and the potential for shared parking with other use types; 
h.  Noise, smoke, etc . The amount and nature of any effects generated on the premises, including but not limited to noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes; 
i.  Utilities . Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use, including but not limited to water supply, waste water output, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or recommended, and any significant power structures and communications towers or facilities; 
j.  Adjacent properties . The impact on adjacent properties created by the proposed use in relation to other uses in the zoning district; 
k.  Other sources . Other sources deemed appropriate by the zoning administrator, such as commonly accepted periodicals, publications by the American Planning Association, and other planning reference books; 
l.  Notice of violation . When the question of the unlisted use arises as a result of a violation, the notice of violation shall be construed to be the zoning administrator's determination that the use is not approved. 
(g)  Standards for any nonresidential use adjacent to residential uses (residential protection standards) . As a condition of the approval of any nonresidential use located adjacent to residential uses, conditions may be applied to reduce or minimize any potential adverse impacts on residential property. Such conditions may include but are not limited to: 
(1)  Hours . Hours of operation and deliveries; 
(2)  Noise and glare . Location on a site of activities that generate potential adverse impacts on adjacent uses such as noise and glare; 
(3)  Loading and delivery areas . Location of loading and delivery areas; 
(4)  Lighting . Lighting location, intensity, and hours of illumination; 
(5)  Outdoor activities and services . Placement and illumination of outdoor vending machines, telephones, or similar outdoor services and activities; 
(6)  Landscaping and buffering . Additional landscaping and buffering to mitigate adverse impacts; 
(7)  Height limitations . Height restrictions to preserve light and privacy and views of significant features from public property and rights-of-way; 
(8)  Access to natural light . Preservation of natural lighting and solar access; and 
(9)  Odors and fumes . Ventilation and control of odors and fumes.

Sec. 78-70.2. - Table of permitted and allowed uses. 
(a)  Purpose . Table 78-70.2(d), Table of Principal Permitted and Allowed Uses, sets forth a summary of the uses permitted within the base zoning districts and indicates whether they are permitted "by right," allowed by special exception or through approval of a zoning map amendment for a planned development district. The use table also includes references to supplemental requirements or regulations applicable to the specific use. 
(b)  Organization of uses and use table . The table of principal permitted and allowed uses, table 78-70.2(d), organizes the uses by principal uses, categories and types and shows the zoning district classifications where various uses are permitted or allowed. 
(1)  Use categories . The use categories describe the major types of uses, based on common characteristics. The common characteristics of each use category are identified in section 78-71, use regulations: principal uses categories, characteristics and types. 
(2)  Use types . The use categories are divided into specific use types that identify the principal uses considered to fall within characteristics identified in the use category. Use types are defined in more detail in Article XVIII, Definitions. 
(c)  Use table format . The symbols listed in the use table have the following meanings: 
(1)  "P" permitted uses . A "P" in a cell indicates that a use category or use type is permitted by right in the respective zoning district, subject to compliance with the use-specific standards set forth in the final column of the table of principal permitted and allowed uses. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this chapter, including those set forth in Article XI, Development Standards. 
(2)  "S" special exception uses . An "S" in a cell indicates that a use type is permitted by special exception in the respective zoning district, subject to compliance with the use-specific standards listed in the final column, if applicable, of Table 78-70.2(d), Table of Principal Permitted and Allowed Uses, and approval of a special exception (Section 78-155.3). It shall be unlawful to conduct a use requiring a special exception without proper approval of a special exception application. 
(3)  "Z" allowed uses . A "Z" in a cell indicates that a use type is an allowed use in the respective planned development district, subject to approval as a planned development district (Section 78-155.1). 
(4)  Uses not allowed . A blank cell indicates that the use type is prohibited in the zoning district. 
(d)  Table of permitted and allowed uses . Table 78-70.2(d), Table of Principal Permitted and Allowed Uses, sets forth the uses permitted within the base zoning districts. See also Table 78-80.2, Accessory Use Table and Table 78-90.1(b) Temporary Uses and Structures.

Sec. 78-71. - Use regulations-Principal use categories, characteristics and types. 
(a)  Purpose . As described above in section 78-70.2(d), the table of principal permitted and allowed uses organizes land uses into groups called "use categories" and lists specific "use types." The following sections contain provisions pertaining to principal uses by use category and use type.

Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use.

(2)  Examples . The "Examples" section under each use category lists examples of uses included in the respective use category. The examples are based on common terms and not on what a specific use may call itself.

This is because the activity on the site matches the characteristics of the personal services and retail sales category. 
(3)  Use types and specific use standards . Definitions for use types are found in Article XVIII, Definitions. The "Specific Use Standards," provides standards for use types are found in sections 78-71.1 through 78-71.19.

Standards are provided in this section for both "use categories" which are defined and described in detail in sections 78-71.1 through 78-71.19 and "use types." Definitions for use types are found in Article XVIII, Definitions. Additional standards throughout this chapter may also apply to use categories and types, such as in Article II, Zoning Districts, or Article XI, Development Standards.

Sec. 78-100.3. - Determination of off-street parking and loading requirements (including mixed uses, variable uses, unspecified uses, and accessible spaces). 
(a)  Parking and loading standards for unlisted uses . Parking and loading standards for uses not specifically listed in Tables 78-100.2(a)-(c), Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, or Table 78-100(d), Required Off-Street Loading Spaces, shall be determined by the zoning administrator based on the standards for the closest comparable use or by reference to standard parking and loading resources published by the National Parking Association or the American Planning Association. The zoning administrator may alternately require, for such uses not specifically listed, that the applicant submit a parking or loading demand study that justifies estimates of parking or loading demand based on the recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers or other credible source, and includes relevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use in terms of density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. 
(b)  Parking and loading standards for uses with variable parking demand characteristics . Uses that reference this section in Table 78-100.2(a), Minimum Off-street Parking Standards for the R-15, R-10, RTC, RM, CS, CO, O&LI, PD-R, PD-B, PD-W zoning districts, may have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it difficult to establish a single off-street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to these standards, the zoning administrator shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking standards on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant. Such a study shall include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the zoning administrator, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. 
(c)  Parking standards for mixed uses . Unless otherwise approved, lots containing more than one use shall provide parking spaces in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all individual uses. 
(d)  Parking standards for accessible spaces for persons with disabilities . When provided as a required accessibility improvement, accessible off-street parking spaces and related access aisles and accessible routes shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code and the Town of Herndon Public Facilities Manual. Additional information concerning the number of required accessible parking spaces for persons with disabilities as well as required signage should be obtained from the office of the Town of Herndon building official. 
(e)  Parking standards for religious institutions . Required parking spaces may be located on a parking lot which is accessory to another principal use which is not open or operating at the time worship services are conducted if this lot is located within 600 feet by the shortest route of effective pedestrian access, from the religious institution. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-100.4. - Computation of off-street parking and loading requirements. 
(a)  Computation of required off-street parking spaces . The following provisions shall be used for the purpose of computing required off-street standing and parking or loading space: 
(1)  Gross floor area . The gross floor area shall be used where calculations are based on floor area. For office uses, health care laboratory, scientific research and development, light manufacturing, gross floor area calculations shall not include elevator shafts, structured parking or atrium space not designed for occupancy and not occupied. 
(2)  Fractional spaces . When application of the requirements would result in a fractional space, the fraction shall be counted as one space. 
(3)  Uncertainty of proposed use . If there is any uncertainty as to the amount of parking space required as a result of indefiniteness of the proposed use of the building or land, the maximum requirement for the general type of use that is involved shall govern. 
(b)  Maximum number of spaces permitted for commercial or service and industrial uses . For any use categorized as a commercial or service and industrial use in Table 78-72(d), Table of Principal Permitted and Allowed Uses, off-street vehicle parking spaces shall not be provided in an amount that is more than 125 percent of the minimum requirements established in Table 78-100.2(a), Minimum Off-street Parking Standards. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-100.5. - Construction, dimension and design standards for off-street parking, loading and stacking. 
(a)  Construction of parking and loading areas . Construction of off-street parking and loading areas shall be subject to the following provisions:

(2)  Construction of off-street parking and loading facilities before zoning permit issuance . All off-street parking and loading facilities shall be completed prior to the issuance of a zoning inspection permit or a zoning appropriateness permit for the use or uses they serve. In the case of phased development, off-street parking and loading need only be provided for the portions of the development for which a zoning inspection permit or zoning appropriateness permit is being issued. 
(3)  Construction materials . The ground surface of parking and stacking areas shall be paved with a durable, dust free and hard material, such as bituminous hot mix or Portland cement, concrete, or some comparable material. Such paving shall be maintained for safe and convenient use at all times. See also section 78-100.8(b)(4), standards for alternative materials. 
(b)  Dimensional standards for parking spaces and aisles . Off-street parking spaces, areas and access aisles areas shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Dimensions of parking spaces and aisles .

Ideally, no more than one two-sided bay of nose-in parking should be placed between the building(s) and the street. 
(5)  Required distance from buildings . All parking areas, other than spaces required on individual lots for single-family detached or single-family attached dwellings, and attached parking garages, shall be separated at least ten feet from buildings to allow room for sidewalks, landscaping, and other plantings between the building and the parking area. This separation may be eliminated in the rear of buildings in areas designed for unloading and loading of materials. 
(6)  Sufficient access for parking and removal of vehicles . In calculating any required parking area (other than for parking spaces required for single-family detached, townhouse, and two-family dwellings), sufficient access and maneuver space shall be provided to permit the parking and removal of any vehicle without moving other vehicles. 
(7)  Delineation of spaces . All parking spaces shall be delineated and periodically restored to maintain a clear identification of separate parking stalls. 
(8)  Screening and landscaping . Screening and landscaping for off-street parking and vehicular stacking areas shall be provided as required in section 78-110.5, vehicular use areas.

(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-100.7. - Public parking options. 
(a)  Public shared parking . Parking requirements may be met through public shared parking in certain areas of the town, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Applicability . The provisions of this subsection apply to land designated planned development downtown (PD-D), planned development traditional downtown (PD-TD) and land zoned central commercial district (CC) in sectors 1 and 2 of the Herndon Downtown, as described in the Herndon 2030 Comprehensive Plan, adopted August 12, 2008 as amended (sectors 1 and 2), where the development applicant has voluntarily respectively proffered or chosen participation in the public shared parking program. In the absence of such a proffer or choice, the other parking requirements set out in this chapter apply to the development. 
(2)  Purpose . The town plans for the provision of public shared parking spaces to serve development and revitalization in sectors 1 and 2. It is the policy of the town that provision of public shared parking spaces or facilities shall be a public-private undertaking to advance the town's public purpose of providing public parking in sectors 1 and 2 for new and expanding development so that the public benefit may be served and sectors 1 and 2 may be adaptively reused and revitalized. 
(3)  Procedure . If public shared parking spaces are available at the time of town council adoption of a zoning map amendment, or staff approval of a site plan or permit, in lieu of providing parking spaces to fulfill the off-street parking standards of this chapter a development applicant or owner may respectively proffer or elect to pay to the town 60 percent of the per space capital cost per subsection 78-100.7(a)(4), below and 50 percent of the per space yearly operation, maintenance and administration cost. 
(4)  Public shared parking cost calculations . Capital and operations costs for public shared parking spaces shall be determined and certified by the town manager, based on an annual review of parking construction costs for projects of comparable scale in the Washington Metropolitan Area or the Commonwealth of Virginia. The projected capital cost of public shared parking spaces to serve development and revitalization in sectors 1 and 2 of the Herndon Downtown is approximately $14,700.00 per space; and annual cost of operations, maintenance and administration of public shared parking spaces is $156.00 per space. The town council, by ordinance, may prospectively adjust the capital cost and the yearly cost for operation, maintenance and administration to reflect the actual cost of these elements, as determined by certification of the town manager. The adjustment may not occur more than once every calendar year. 
(5)  Computation of public shared parking space and loading requirements . The following standards shall apply to public shared parking: 
a.  Parking space standards shall be computed at the rate of 3.3 spaces per 1,000 gross square feet of nonresidential floor area in the proposed development. 
b.  Parking space standards shall be computed at the rate of 1.5 per dwelling unit of which only 0.5 or less may be in the form of public shared parking. Public shared parking for residential development is limited to multi-family uses. 
c.  In case of conflict with the standards in Table 78-100.2(a), the standards in this subsection prevail. 
d.  Reserved spaces shall not be counted for the purpose of computing the required number of spaces except those spaces reserved for and marked for use by persons with disabilities. 
e.  There shall be no double counting of public shared parking spaces. 
f.  In cases where public shared parking is used (see section 78-100.7(a)) the developer or owner shall provide loading spaces on site, unless physically impossible due to existing development, as determined by the zoning administrator. In the latter case, the developer or owner may provide such spaces in the public shared parking lot or facility by special arrangements, to accommodate loading space size requirements. 
(6)  Limitations on use of public shared parking areas . Vehicle storage, vehicle repair and recreational vehicle parking shall not be permitted in public shared parking areas. 
(7)  Town authority and public shared parking facilities . Any public shared parking provided by the town, shall be controlled by the town through lease, license, or fee ownership of the land, real estate, or other facilities within sectors 1 and 2 for public shared parking pursuant to this section. The town shall provide such land, real estate, or other facilities upon the physical occupancy of such building or structure, to which such parking pertains, as certified in writing by the zoning administrator and filed in the office of the town clerk. The town council shall declare by resolution public land, real estate, or other facilities to be used for public shared parking. The town council by resolution may amend the declaration; may substitute new land, real estate, or other facilities for land, real estate or other facilities formerly so declared; or may release land, real estate, or other facilities from such a declaration. The gross number of spaces designated by the town and available as set out above as public shared parking shall be equivalent to or greater than the gross number of spaces allocated through development approval for participation in the public shared parking program. 
(8)  Public shared parking option runs with land . A public shared parking option shall attach to the land and bind the successors and assigns of the person who applied for and is provided the rights and responsibilities of public shared parking. 
(9)  Town retains police power over public land used for public shared parking facilities . In declaring public land to be used for public shared parking, the town council retains full police power over the land. The land shall be characterized as land in the nature of a public street or public square. The town council, among other powers, may restrict condition, authorize temporary private use of under general law, temporarily prevent, or otherwise control the terms of public use of this land, while substantively realizing the goal of providing public parking. 
(b)  Public parking alternative . Parking requirements may be met through a public parking alternative in certain areas of the town, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Applicability . The provisions of this subsection apply to land designated planned development downtown (PD-D), planned development traditional downtown (PD-TD) and land zoned central commercial district (CC) in sectors 1 and 2 of the Herndon Downtown, as described in the Herndon 2030 Comprehensive Plan, adopted August 12, 2008 as amended (sectors 1 and 2), where the development applicant has voluntarily respectively proffered or chosen participation in the public parking alternative program. In the absence of such a proffer or choice, the other parking requirements set out in this chapter apply to the development. 
(2)  Purpose . The town plans for the provision of an adequate number of public parking spaces to serve development and revitalization in sectors 1 and 2. It is the policy of the town that provision of public parking spaces or facilities shall be a public-private undertaking to advance the town's public purpose of providing public parking in sectors 1 and 2 so that the public benefit may be served and sectors 1 and 2 may be adaptively reused and revitalized. 
(3)  Procedure . A development applicant may respectively proffer or elect to dedicate to the town up to 100 percent of those parking spaces serving proposed ground floor commercial uses, and up to 0.5 parking spaces per proposed multi-family unit located on the property in question. 
(4)  Public parking alternative payment calculations . The town shall pay to the development applicant or its successor 40 percent of the per space capital cost, to be determined at the time of proffer or dedication, and 50 percent of the per space yearly operation, maintenance and administration cost. Such capital and operations costs shall be determined and certified by the town manager, based on an annual review of parking construction costs for projects of comparable scale in the Washington Metropolitan Area and Commonwealth of Virginia. The town council, by ordinance, may prospectively adjust the capital cost and the yearly cost for operation, maintenance and administration to reflect the actual cost of these elements, as determined by certification of the town manager. The adjustment may not occur more than once every calendar year. 
(5)  Computation of spaces for the public parking alternative . The following standards shall apply to parking provided under the public parking alternative. 
a.  Parking space standards shall be computed at the rate of 3.3 spaces per 1,000 gross square feet of ground floor commercial space in the proposed development. Additional commercial square footage shall be parked on site and paid for in full by the developer or private property owner. 
b.  Parking space standards for multi-family units shall be computed at the rate of 1.5 per dwelling unit of which only 0.5 or less may be in the form of parking under the public parking alternative program. The developer or private property owner shall be responsible for providing the remaining private parking spaces per unit at full cost. 
c.  In case of conflict with the standards of Table 78-100.2(a) the standards in this subsection prevail. 
(6)  Limitations on use of public parking alternative areas . Vehicle storage, vehicle repair and recreational vehicle parking shall not be permitted in public parking alternative areas. 
(7)  Public parking alternative option runs with land . The public parking alternative option shall attach to the land and bind the successors and assigns of the person who applied for and is provided the rights and responsibilities of public shared parking. 
(8)  Town authority and public parking alternative program spaces . Spaces designated as public though the public parking alternative program shall be under the control of the town and the town shall have the authority to control and manage the public parking as it sees fit. The town council shall possess full police power over the portion of land or structure designated as public though the public parking alternative program land. The land shall be characterized as land in the nature of a public street or public square. The town council, among other powers, may restrict, condition, authorize temporary private use of under general law, temporarily prevent, or otherwise control the terms of public use of this land, while substantively realizing the goal of providing public parking.

Sec. 78-100.8. - Parking alternatives. 
(a)  Town council review . For developments that are the subject of a zoning map amendment, special exception, or preliminary subdivision plan, the town council may consider, approve, or disapprove requests for the following alternatives to providing the number of required off-street parking spaces required by Table 78-100.2 Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, in accordance with the respective standards. 
(1)  Inter-parcel access . For all developments, the town council by ordinance, may determine to approve an inter-parcel connection with a corresponding reduction of parking as to the requirements of Table 78-100.2(a) Minimum Off-street Parking Standards. Any such reduction shall be the minimum necessary to accommodate the inter-parcel connection. 
(2)  Standards for inter-parcel access . The town council shall be guided by these standards in the determination for inter-parcel access: (i) improvement in the traffic or pedestrian safety or convenience of traffic circulation; and adequate storm water management. 
(3)  Inter-parcel access agreement . Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an applicant landowner to achieve an inter-parcel connection agreement with another adjacent landowner. The town council however, may require that the applicant landowner make physical or planning provisions for the eventual completion of an inter-parcel connector to achieve the reduced parking to accommodate the inter-parcel connection. Any agreement to achieve inter-parcel connection must be in recordable form and recorded by the parties to the agreement in the land records of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County. 
(b)  Zoning administrator review . For developments that have not been approved under a zoning map amendment, special exception, or preliminary subdivision plan, and are the subject of a zoning inspection permit or a zoning appropriateness permit, the zoning administrator may consider requests for the following alternatives to mitigate existing conditions that may be insurmountable or too onerous to provide the number of required off-street parking spaces required by Table 78-100.2(a): Minimum Off-street Parking Standards, in accordance with the respective standards. 
(1)  Standards for private shared parking for land uses with different operating hours or different peak business periods . 
a.  Shared parking spaces are to be located within 500 feet of the primary entrance of all uses served, unless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. Shared parking spaces are not separated from the use they serve by an arterial or collector road. In addition, adequate and safe pedestrian access is provided from and to the shared parking areas. 
b.  A shared parking area is located on a site with the same or more intensive zoning classification than required for the primary uses served. 
c.  Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying the off-street parking standards must submit a shared parking request to the zoning administrator that justifies the feasibility of shared parking. Justification includes information on the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover, and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that share off-street parking spaces. 
1.  The maximum reduction in the number of parking spaces required for all uses sharing the parking area shall be 35 percent. 
2.  Directional signage that meets the requirements of this chapter shall be added to direct the public to the shared parking spaces. It is preferable for the employees of the affected establishment to utilize these spaces. 
d.  A shared parking plan is enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record is submitted to the zoning administrator for review prior to its recordation by the owners. Recordation of the agreement takes place before issuance of a building permit, zoning inspection permit or zoning appropriateness permit for any use to be served by the shared parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked by the applicant only if all required off-street parking spaces are provided in accordance with the requirements of Table 78-100.2(a): Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards. If the zoning administrator determines that a change in use of any establishment involved in the shared parking agreement necessitates a change in the agreement to satisfy the parking requirements of the new use or uses, the applicant shall amend the agreement accordingly and provide the additional parking needed to comply with the parking requirements of Table 78-100.2(a): Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards. 
(2)  Off-site parking . Parking shall be located on the same site as the principal use. Parking that is off-site and off-street may be permitted only where there are practical difficulties in the location of the parking area on-site or if the public safety or public convenience, or both, is better served by the location of required parking on another parcel of land. The zoning administrator may permit off-site parking if the zoning administrator determines that the following standards are met: 
a.  The parking area is located on land under the same ownership or the use it serves. 
b.  A pedestrian way, not more than 600 feet in length, is established from the parking area to the use to be served. 
c.  The parking area is convenient to use without causing unreasonable: 
1.  Hazard to pedestrians; 
2.  Hazard to vehicular traffic; 
3.  Traffic congestion; 
4.  Interference with commercial activity or convenient access to other parking areas in the vicinity; 
5.  Detriment to the appropriate use of business property in the vicinity; or 
6.  Detriment to any abutting residential neighborhood. 
(3)  Standards for valet and tandem parking . Tandem parking is permitted for nonresidential uses only if all of the standards below are satisfied: 
a.  Limited tandem parking for commercial and industrial uses is provided only for development that requires 75 or more parking spaces. 
b.  No more than 30 percent of the total number of spaces is designated as tandem. 
c.  A valet parking attendant is on duty during hours of operation. 
(4)  Standards for alternative materials . The zoning administrator may approve alternative materials based on the following standards: 
a.  Porous parking area surfacing may be considered for purposes of facilitating on-site stormwater control or environmental conservation. It is not intended for porous parking area surfacing to facilitate temporary parking arrangements or economy of site development. 
b.  In accordance with the Herndon Public Facilities Manual, as a special asphaltic paving material that allows stormwater to infiltrate at a high rate. Infiltrated water is temporarily retained below the pavement within a high-void aggregate base. Porous pavement is applicable as a substitute for conventional asphalt pavement on parking areas. 
c.  Porous parking area surfacing materials are not located on easements for underground utilities, in accordance with the Herndon Public Facilities Manual. 
d.  In accordance with section 78-115(a), for a reduction in the minimum number of required parking spaces for tree preservation, alternative paving materials may be required by the zoning administrator in cases where required parking areas encroach upon critical root zones. 
e.  Porous parking areas are properly maintained. 
f.  Where possible porous parking area surfacing materials are used in areas proximate to and in combination with on-site stormwater control devices.

(c)  Preventative measures for encroachments . Encroachments within the critical root zones of trees, or within designated tree protection zones, shall occur only in rare instances. If such an encroachment is anticipated, the following preventive measures shall be employed: 
(1)  Trenching adjacent to tree save areas . The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is strongly recommended to cut minimum one and one/half-foot trenches along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut and root prune, rather than tear, roots. 
(2)  Compaction . Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials through the tree protection zone, the area must first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips, a six-inch layer of pine straw, or an approved specialized mat. Equipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within tree protection zone areas.

Sec. 78-111.4. - Tree preservation credit. 
(a)  Existing healthy trees may be credited toward landscaping requirements . Except as provided in this section, existing, healthy trees which are to be preserved may be included to meet all or part of the landscaping requirements described in section 78-110, landscaping, if the site plan, preliminary subdivision plan or single lot development plan identifies such trees. Existing trees that are not in a required buffer area shall not be included to meet any part of the landscape requirements for buffers. 
(b)  Tree preservation credit multipliers . In order to encourage the preservation of trees on a site, a tree preservation credit for trees that are not destroyed as a result of the construction process may be granted. The credit provided will be 1.25 multiplied by the number of preserved trees as delineated on the site plan, preliminary subdivision plan or single lot development plan and surveyed in the field. A higher factor of up to 4.0 may be used for trees of outstanding size and quality if approved by the zoning administrator. This number shall be subtracted equally from the canopy and evergreen tree requirements.

Sec. 78-111.5. - Adjustments to other zoning standards to allow for tree preservation. 
(a)  Administrative adjustments from required building setbacks . An encroachment into a required building setback of up to five percent may be approved by the zoning administrator through the administrative adjustment procedure (see section 78-155.5) as a way to accommodate healthy existing trees and their root zones. This provision shall not be construed to allow a structure to exceed the maximum floor area as specified in dimensional standards for individual zoning districts in Article IV, Article V or Article VI. 
(b)  Reduction in the minimum number of required parking spaces . Up to a five percent reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required on the site shall be allowed if the reduction in the amount of required pavement will preserve the root zones of existing healthy trees with a diameter at breast height of ten inches or greater. The amount of reduction can be determined only after taking into consideration any unique site conditions and the impact of the reduction on parking needs for the use, and must be agreed upon by both the applicant and zoning administrator. Alternative paving materials (see section 78-100.8(b)(4), standards for alternative materials) may be required by the zoning administrator in cases where required parking areas encroach upon critical root zones.

Financial guarantees shall be returned following the issuance of an occupancy permit, or upon completion of the establishment period for replacement vegetation specified in section 78-112(b), replacement and mitigation requirements. 
(c)  Separate violation . Each tree unlawfully removed or destroyed after submittal of a site plan, subdivision plan or single lot development plan, or inconsistent with an approved site plan, subdivision plan, single lot development plan, final subdivision plat, proffered zoning map amendment, or special exception shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter.

During certain seasons of the year, or due to the steps in the construction process, it may be impractical for some public improvements to be installed or totally completed (e.g., the final lift of asphalt on a street, street trees, and the like) prior to occupancy or use of the property. When early occupancy is requested in writing prior to the completion of such improvements, the zoning administrator may allow early site occupancy when the following requirements are satisfied. As part of the procedure for the request for site occupancy, town staff will inspect the site and prepare a provisional report of the site inspector and zoning conformance findings which is referenced under these requirements. All the following requirements must be met: 
(1)  Written request . A written request shall be made at least 30 days in advance of the requested occupancy date; the written request shall include a list of items not completed, documentation for how the items will be completed (such as contracts), the timeline for completion of the items, and justification for delay in completion of the items; 
(2)  Provisional report . Based on a provisional report prepared by the town staff, staff may determine that the site can function without the subject improvements without creating a threat to health, safety, and welfare, and without detrimental impacts to the surrounding properties or town service provision in the area;

(5)  Re-inspection and update . Upon request by the applicant, or on or after the date of anticipated completion of improvements as specified in the original written request by the applicant, town staff may re-inspect the property and update the provisional report described in paragraph (2), above. If the applicant does not adhere to the time for completion of improvements: 
a.  Zoning violation proceedings may commence in accordance with section 78-170.3. 
b.  A fee will be charged for each inspection and re-inspection necessitated by the early occupancy request in accordance with section 78-152.2(b)(3)c. 
c.  Any future town approvals for early occupancy prior to completion of all required improvements within the associated development may cease. 
(6)  Uniform Building Code requirements . These provisions do not relieve the applicant from the responsibility for meeting all applicable requirements of the Uniform Statewide Building Code prior to building occupancy. 
(g)  Release . Upon satisfactory completion of the following requirements, the town manager may, following a recommendation in the form of a release from the directors of community development, finance, and public works, release the security in accordance with the standards in Code of Virginia § 15.2-2245, (as amended).

Upon completion of all physical improvements shown on the approved plan, whether on-site or off-site, including acceptance of streets and other improvements in any dedicated right-of-way, the applicant may initiate the release of the security by a written request for a final inspection by the town. A status report showing the pass/fail list of cumulative items outstanding shall be sent to the applicant within 30 days of the receipt for release of the security. The applicant shall remedy the items on the list at the applicant's expense within 30 days after the receipt date of the list or other time as prescribed by the inspector. The applicant may then re-initiate the release of the security, as above. The town staff shall issue a final inspection report, provided that all physical improvements covered by the security have been completed and accepted. 
b.  The "as-built" site plan shall be approved by the town and accepted. 
(h)  Filing fee . A filing fee, tabulated in accordance with the fees in section 78-152.2(b)(3)c. shall be paid prior to submittal of a performance guarantee, request for an extension of time, request for reduction of a performance guarantee, or a request to replace a performance guarantee. 
(i)  Indemnity insurance. The owner, owner's agent, or developer shall furnish such insurance as is deemed necessary by the town, and approved as to form by the town attorney, to indemnify and hold harmless the town from any and all liability arising by reason of the unimproved conditions of the development that may arise or grow out of the construction or installation of such public improvements.

A copy of the insurance policy shall be filed in the office of the zoning administrator. 
(j)  Forfeiture . Repayment of the performance guarantee may be forfeited under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Failure to install improvements . If an owner, owner's agent, or developer fails to properly install all required improvements within 30 days of the third zoning violation issued in accordance with subsection (6)e. of this section, or other time as determined by the zoning administrator, the town shall give 30-days written notice to the owner, owner's agent, or developer (if different) by certified mail, after which time the town may draw on the performance guarantee and use the funds to complete the required improvements. The performance guarantee agreement may provide for more timely action in the event of a threat to public health or safety. 
(2)  Report of expenditures. After completing the required improvements, the town shall provide a complete accounting of the expenditures to the property owner, owner's agent, or developer (as appropriate) and, as applicable, refund all unused security deposited, without interest, to the party posting the guarantee.

Sec. 78-130.4. - Smoke and particulate matter standards. 
(a)  Required performance level . No operation or activity shall cause or create the emission of smoke from any vent, stack, chimney, flue or other opening that exceeds the density or equivalent opacity prescribed in this division. The total emission of particular matter from all vents, stacks, chimneys, flues or other openings of any process, operation or activity shall not exceed the particulate matter limitations prescribed in this division. 
(b)  General limitations . The following limitations shall apply to emissions: 
(1)  Particulate matter . Particulate matter emissions caused by the wind from open storage areas, yards, roads, etc., shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling, wetting or other means. 
(2)  Limit on open air emissions . No operation shall cause or allow to be emitted into the open air from any process or control equipment or to pass any convenient measuring point in a breaching or stack particulate matter in the gases that exceeds 0.60 pounds per 1,000 pounds of gases during any one hour. 
(c)  Method of measurement . The following provisions shall apply to measurement of emissions: 
(1)  Smoke . For the purpose of determining the density or equivalent opacity of smoke, the Ringelmann Smoke Chart as adopted and published by the United States Bureau of Mines in Information Circular No. 8333 shall be employed. 
(2)  Particulate matter . Particulate matter loadings in pounds per acre described in this section shall be determined by selecting a continuous four-hour period which will result in the highest average emission rate. In computing pounds per acre, the gross area of the zoning lot on which the use is located shall be employed. 
(d)  Standards for all nonresidential uses . The following standards shall be used to evaluate emissions: 
(1)  Smoke standards . The continuous emission of smoke from any vent, stack, chimney or combustion process shall not exceed a density or equivalent opacity of Ringelmann No. 1. Smoke exceeding Ringelmann No. 1, but not exceeding Ringelmann No. 3, shall be permitted up to six minutes during any four-hour period. Smoke in excess of Ringelmann No. 3 is prohibited. 
(2)  Particulate matter standards . The emission of particulate matter from all vents, stacks, chimneys and openings of any operation shall not exceed 0.2 pounds per hour, per acre. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-130.5. - Toxic matter standards. 
(a)  Required performance level . No operation or activity shall cause or create the emission of toxic matter in amounts or quantities that exceed the levels prescribed in this section. 
(b)  Method of measurement . In determining the maximum permissible concentration allowed an industrial worker, the most recent listing of threshold limit values published by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists shall be used. If a toxic substance is not contained in the most recent listing of threshold limit values published by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, then the applicant shall produce sufficient and satisfactory evidence showing that the proposed levels are safe to the general population. Concentrations shall be measured and calculated as the highest average that could occur over a continuous eight-hour period. 
(c)  Standards for all nonresidential uses . The release of airborne toxic matter (including radioactive matter) shall not exceed five percent of the maximum permissible concentration allowed an industrial worker when measured at any point beyond the lot line, either at ground level or habitable elevation, whichever is more restrictive.

(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-130.9. - Exterior lighting. 
(a)  Applicability . Various sections of this chapter address the need for site lighting to maintain adequate lighting levels on site and provide security for people and property. The installation of site lighting for these purposes may be required with development of townhouse, two-family, and multiple-family dwellings, public and institutional, commercial, and service and industrial uses. Whether required under this chapter, or provided at the applicant's option, the following standards shall be applied to exterior lighting. 
(b)  Compliance . In addition to the standards contained in this section, exterior lighting shall also comply with the Herndon Guidelines for Planning and Design of Town Streetscape Projects (dated November 25, 2008, as may be amended, located in the Herndon Department of Community Development) as described in section 1-16, Herndon Town Code (2000) as amended. 
(c)  Inconsistencies . Where there is conflict of inconsistency between this article and the Herndon Guidelines for Planning and Design of Town Streetscape Projects (dated November 25, 2008, as may be amended, located in the Herndon Department of Community Development) as described in section 1-16, Herndon Town Code (2000) as amended, the more restrictive standard shall apply. 
(d)  Site lighting plan . Any development proposed within the town shall conform to the town's exterior lighting standards. As part of the site plan review process, information about site lighting shall be provided as required in section 78-155.6. 
(e)  Exterior lighting standards . Exterior lighting shall meet the following standards: 
(1)  Hours of illumination. Properties on which public and institutional uses, commercial uses, and service and industrial uses are located that are adjacent to existing residential development or vacant land in a residential zoning district have lighting that is turned off during non-operating hours, except lighting that is necessary for security or emergency purposes. Such lighting may be activated on-site by motion sensor devices. 
(2)  Fixtures . Lighting is provided through the use of fixtures that are durable, yet avoid the use of tall light fixtures that unnecessarily disperse light and glare to surrounding properties. 
(3)  Illumination direction . In all residential districts, lighting of nonresidential properties is directed downward except for low-voltage architectural lighting. 
(4)  Maximum lighting height . Maximum lighting height shall conform to the following: 
a.  Residential property light fixtures are no more than 14 feet above grade. 
b.  On nonresidential properties, outdoor lighting is no greater than 15 feet in height, whether mounted on poles or walls or by other means, except: 
1.  Light fixtures in parking lots containing between 100 and 250 spaces are no more than 25 feet high; and; 
2.  Light fixtures in parking lots containing more than 250 spaces are no higher than 35 feet in height; 
3.  In any event, where visible from residential properties, fixtures do not exceed 20 feet above grade; 
4.  Wherever possible, illumination of outdoor seating areas, building entrances, and walkways is accomplished by use of ground mounted fixtures not more than four feet in height. 
(5)  Shielding . Lighting shall be shielded as follows: 
a.  Light fixtures in excess of 60 watts or 100 lumens use full cut-off lenses, hoods other shielding as warranted to prevent glare or spillover from the project site onto adjacent properties and roadways. 
b.  No light source emits light directly onto adjacent residential property. 
c.  No light source in a canopy structure extends downward further than the lowest edge of the canopy ceiling. 
d.  Awnings or canopies used for building accents over doors, windows, etc., are not internally illuminated (i.e., from underneath or behind the awning). 
(6)  Maximum light levels . Outdoor lighting and indoor lighting visible from outside are designed and located so that the maximum illumination measured in foot candles at a vertical distance of three feet above grade at the property line do not exceed the standards in Table 78-130.9(e)(6), maximum illumination values. Cut-off lighting shall be designed to direct light downward (e.g., shoe box style). In any case, spillage of indirect light onto adjacent residential properties is 0.1 foot candles or less, or 1.0 foot candles or less for other uses, measured at the boundary line of the site.

(7)  Uniformity ratios . The ratio of maximum to minimum lighting on a given property measured at ground level, does not exceed 15:1 in the residential districts; 10:1 in the business districts; and 3:1 in parking lots. 
(8)  Direction of lighting . No light source is directed outward toward property boundaries or adjacent rights-of-way. No light source directly illuminates facades of buildings visible from residential properties. 
(9)  Distance from property line . All exterior lighting fixtures are located a minimum of ten feet from a property line or five feet from a right-of-way line and are not located within a required perimeter buffer or streetscape unless they are located at the interior edge of the buffer or streetscape. 
(10)  Hue . Lighting sources are color-neutral types such as LED (light emitting diode) or metal halide. Light types of limited spectral emission such as low-pressure sodium or mercury vapor lights, are prohibited. 
(11)  Wall-mounted lights . Wall-mounted lights (other than entry lights of 100 watts or less) are fully shielded luminaries (such as shoebox or can style fixtures) to direct all light downward, and to prevent the light source from being visible from any adjacent residential property or public street right-of-way. 
(12)  Floodlights and spotlights . Floodlights or other type of lighting attached to light poles that illuminate the site and/or building(s) are prohibited. Permitted floodlights and spotlights are selected, located, aimed, and shielded so that direct illumination is focused exclusively on a portion of the building facade or other intended site feature and away from adjoining properties or the right-of-way. On-site lighting may be used to accent architectural elements but is not used to illuminate entire portions of building(s). Such lighting is installed in a fixture that is shielded so that no portion of the light bulb extends below the bottom edge of the shield, and the main beam from the light source is not visible from adjacent properties of the adjacent right-of-way. 
(13)  Wall pack lights . Wall packs on buildings may be used at entrances to a building to light unsafe areas. Such lights are not used to draw attention to the building or provide general building or site lighting. "Wall Packs" on the exterior of the building are fully shielded (true cut-off type bulb or light source not visible from off-site) to direct the light vertically downward at an angle that will limit output to prevent glare on adjacent property and be of low wattage (preferably 100 watts or lower). Wall pack lights visible from any location off the site are prohibited. 
(14)  Illumination of outdoor sports fields and performance areas . Lighting of outdoor sports fields and performance areas shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  All lighting fixtures shall be equipped with a glare control package (e.g., louvers, shields, or similar devices), and the fixtures shall be aimed so that their beams are directed and fall within the primary playing or performance area; and 
b.  The hours of operation for the lighting system for any game or event shall not exceed one hour after the end of the game or event. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
ARTICLE XIV. - SIGNS 

Sec. 78-140. - Signs. 
    The following sections pertain to signs and signage in all zoning districts. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-140.1. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose . Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this article is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas, and the safety and welfare of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development. This article allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size and purpose of all signs. 
(b)  Intent . A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein shall be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in subsection (a) of this section. These provisions are further intended to: 
(1)  Promote compatibility . These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition. 
(2)  Distinguish between areas . These regulations are intended to distinguish between portions of the town designed for primarily vehicular access and portions of the town designed for primarily pedestrian access. 
(3)  Meet purpose and scope of article . These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual speech that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the town. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above. 
(4)  Provide balance . These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs. 
(c)  Applicability . Signs not expressly permitted as being allowed by right or by specific requirements in another portion of this chapter are forbidden. 
(d)  Interpretation and protection of free speech . This article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. 
(e)  Substitution of noncommercial content . Wherever this article permits a sign with commercial content, noncommercial content is also permitted subject to the same requirements of size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height and construction. 
(f)  Validity . If any provision of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision. 
(g)  Effective date. This chapter shall be effective on and after the date of its adoption. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-140.2. - Sign related definitions. 
    See Article XVIII for definitions pertaining to signs and signage in all zoning districts. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-140.3. - Measurements of sign area and height. 
    The following measurement provisions pertain to signs and signage in all zoning districts. 
(a)  Support structures . Supports, uprights or structure on which any sign is supported shall not be included in determining the sign area unless such supports, uprights or structure are designed in such a way as to form an integral background of the display; except, however, when a sign is placed on a fence, wall, planter, or other similar structure that is designed to serve a separate purpose other than to support the sign, the entire area of such structure shall not be computed. In such cases, the sign area shall be computed in accordance with the preceding provisions. 
(b)  Multiple tenants . In instances where there are multiple tenants or users on a property or in a building, allowable sign area for all parties shall not exceed the maximum sign area computed as if there were a single tenant or user. 
(c)  Sign area . Sign area is calculated under the following principles: 
(1)  Sign face . The area of a sign face shall be the area within four straight lines forming a rectangle (a maximum of two abutting or overlapping rectangles may be used) enclosing the extreme limits of the sign including any material or color of the background of the sign that is used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure. 
(2)  Double-faced signs . The area of a double-faced sign shall be the area of one side only provided that the faces are either parallel or have an internal angle between its two faces of no more than 45 degrees. If one side is larger than the other the larger of the two shall be used to calculate area. 
(d)  Sign height . Freestanding sign height is measured from normal grade at the base of the sign to the top of the highest component of the sign. Wall sign height is measured from normal grade at the base of the building elevation on which the sign is located to the top of the highest component of the sign. 
(e)  Building frontage (as relates to signage) . For freestanding signs, sign area is calculated based on linear footage of the building elevation which faces the public right-of-way on which the sign is located. For wall signs, sign area is calculated based on the linear footage of the building elevation on which the sign is located. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-140.4. - Prohibited signs. 
(a)  General prohibitions . In addition to signs prohibited elsewhere in this Code or by applicable state or federal law, the following signs are prohibited: 
(1)  Signs that violate any law of the Commonwealth relating to outdoor advertising.

(12)  Signs that emit sound. 
(13)  Any electronic sign that is generated by a series of moving images, such as an LED, digital display, or other video technology, whether displayed on a building, vehicle, or mobile unit. 
(14)  Strings of flags or pennants. 
(15)  Pole signs. 
(16)  Off-site signs. 
(17)  Signs erected on public land other than those approved by an authorized town official in writing, required by law without such approval, or permitted under Virginia Code § 24.2-310E. Any sign not so authorized is subject to immediate removal and disposal by any authorized official. Removal of the sign under this provision does not preclude prosecution of the person responsible for the sign. 
(18)  Signs on the roof surface or extending above the roofline of a building or its parapet wall. 
(19)  Neon signs, except when no more than two square feet and installed in windows, and except as permitted in the CC, PD-D, PD-TD and PD-TOC zoning districts.

Freestanding signs shall not be mounted on a single pole or post and any voids in the sign structure base between the ground and the bottom edge of the sign shall not exceed three feet in height. 
(4)  Landscaping . All non-temporary freestanding signs shall be installed with a minimum surround of four feet of regularly maintained floral and shrubbery landscaping in every direction. 
(c)  Wall signs . Wall signs shall be located on building elevations per the following criteria:

(4)  Limitations on internally illuminated wall sign . Internally illuminated wall signs shall not be placed on any building elevation that faces adjacent properties zoned residential. 
(d)  Sign illumination . Lighting shall be the minimum necessary to be visible at night time and shall not create a distraction or other hazard, such as pinpoint glare, to vehicular traffic and shall conform to the following standards: 
(1)  Indirect lighting . In the case of indirect lighting, the source shall be so shielded that it illuminates only the face of the sign. Indirect lighting shall consist of full cut-off or directionally shielded lighting fixtures that are aimed and controlled so that the directed light shall be substantially confined to the sign to minimize glare, sky glow, and light trespass. The beam width shall not be wider than that needed to light the sign. The light source shall have a neutral hue and be consistent for all fixtures illuminating a single sign. 
(2)  Internal and halo illumination . Internal illumination and halo illumination shall not be permitted to have an illumination spread of more than .05-foot candle at the lot line, shine into on-coming traffic, affect highway safety, or shine directly into a residential dwelling unit. The background of internally illuminated signs shall be designed so that the illumination only penetrates the letters, logos, symbols, or other message copy.

(g)  Safety hazard . Any sign which becomes a safety hazard or which is not kept in good general condition and reasonably good state of repair and is not, after written notice to the owner of the premises or the permittee, put in a safe and good state of repair may be removed, repaired or otherwise abated by the building official in accordance with Chapter 10 of this Code. Any sign which, in the opinion of the building official, constitutes an immediate or imminent danger to life or property may be caused to be removed or put in a safe condition by him immediately. 
(h)  Removal . Any sign, located on commercial property where the use or business has ceased operating shall, within 30 days of the cessation of use or business operation, be removed and the area on which the sign was installed shall be repaired to its original condition by the business or property owner.

(a)  Nonconforming sign status . Signs lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter or prior ordinances, which do not conform to the provisions of this chapter, and signs which are accessory to a nonconforming use shall be deemed to be nonconforming signs and may remain except as qualified below. The burden of establishing nonconforming status of signs and of the physical characteristics/location of such signs shall be that of the owner of the property. Upon notice from the zoning administrator, a property owner shall submit verification that sign(s) were lawfully existing at time of erection. Failure to provide such verification shall be cause for order to remove sign(s) or bring sign(s) into compliance with the current ordinance. 
(b)  Limitation on expansion and degree of nonconformity . No nonconforming sign shall be enlarged nor shall any feature of a nonconforming sign, such as illumination, be increased or added. 
(c)  Limitation on alterations other than repairs . Nonconforming signs shall not be extended or structurally reconstructed or altered in any manner, except a sign face may be changed so long as the new face is equal to or reduced in height and/or sign area. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent keeping in good repair a nonconforming sign. 
(d)  Location . No nonconforming sign shall be moved for any distance on the same lot or to any other lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform in all respects to the provisions of this article. 
(e)  Restoration after damage . A nonconforming sign that is destroyed or damaged by any casualty to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of its area may be restored within two years after such destruction or damage but shall not be enlarged in any manner. If such sign is so destroyed or damaged to an extent exceeding 50 percent, it shall not be reconstructed but may be replaced with a sign that is in full accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(f)  Change in status . A nonconforming sign which is changed to becoming conforming or is replaced by a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and thereafter such sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(g)  Removal . A nonconforming sign structure shall be subject to the removal provisions of section 78-160.3. In addition, a nonconforming sign structure shall be removed if the use to which it is accessory has not been in operation for a period of two years or more. Such structure sign shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign structure, the zoning administrator or designee shall give the owner 15 days' written notice to remove it. Upon failure to comply with this notice, the zoning administrator or designee may enter the property upon which the sign is located and remove any such sign or may initiate such action as may be necessary to gain compliance with this provision.

A pre-application conference is mandatory prior to submittal of any application for an amendment to the official zoning map (section 78-155.1), special exception (section 78-155.3), single lot development plan (section 78-155.6(e)), site plans (major and minor) (section 78-155.6(e)(3)), and subdivision plans. A pre-application conference is optional prior to submittal of any other application for development approval under this chapter. 
(3)  Non-binding . The pre-application conference is intended to facilitate the review of development applications. Discussions held pursuant to this section are not binding on the town or applicant. Processing times for review of development applications do not begin until a formal, complete application is submitted and determined to be complete. 
(4)  Procedure . The procedure for the pre-application conference request and meeting is as follows: 
a.  Any applicant subject to a mandatory pre-application conference or any other applicant requesting a pre-application conference shall request it in writing from the zoning administrator. Along with the request, the applicant shall provide to the zoning administrator a description of the character, location, and magnitude or scale of the proposed development, and any other appropriate supporting information and documents, such as a sketch or concept plan (if appropriate). 
b.  Upon receipt of the request, the zoning administrator may waive this pre-application requirement if it is determined that the nature and magnitude of the project do not make it necessary for the applicant to be familiar with the application provisions of this chapter, or for the staff to be familiar with the project proposal prior to the application submittal. 
c.  The zoning administrator shall schedule promptly a pre-application conference after receipt of the request and the appropriate submittal materials. The zoning administrator shall review the materials and forward them to other members of the town staff, and to any local, regional, state, and federal agency officials the zoning administrator determines should participate in the pre-application conference. 
d.  At the pre-application conference the applicant, the zoning administrator, and any other town staff and local, regional, state, or federal representatives the zoning administrator determines appropriate, shall discuss the proposed development, and based upon the information provided by the applicant, identify in general what provisions apply to the proposed development. The zoning administrator shall generally inform the applicant regarding necessary application materials and provide estimates of the timing of review. 
(b)  Neighborhood meeting . A neighborhood meeting is strongly encouraged prior to filing certain types of development applications, as follows. 
(1)  Purpose . Neighborhood meetings are opportunities for informal communication between landowners, applicants, and residents who may be affected by development proposals. The purposes of the neighborhood meeting are to: 
a.  Educate neighbors about the proposed development and application, 
b.  Receive neighborhood comments, 
c.  Address concerns about the development proposal and, 
d.  Resolve conflicts and outstanding issues, where possible. 
(2)  Timing of meeting for zoning map amendments (rezonings) . At least one neighborhood meeting is strongly encouraged for a zoning map amendment application prior to filing the application if any part of the property proposed for zoning map amendment is abutting or across the street from existing residences. The applicant shall file a report of the neighborhood meeting with the application for zoning map amendment. 
(3)  Timing of meeting for other applications requiring public hearings . Neighborhood meetings generally are encouraged prior to, or shortly after, submittal of other applications requiring a public hearing. The town council, planning commission, architectural review board or heritage preservation review board may encourage an applicant to conduct a neighborhood meeting on an application if, in the determination of the review board, the proposed development could affect neighboring properties.

No application for a change of zoning on the same parcel of land shall be considered by the town council within a period of time of one year from its last consideration by the town council.

b.  The submittal of proffers or substantially amended proffers after that deadline shall require, at the town council's discretion, either the referral of the application to the planning commission for further review, or the postponement of town council action on the application until council's next public hearing on the application. The public hearing on the application shall either be continued or rescheduled. 
c.  For the purpose of this chapter, a substantially amended proffer includes one that expands the scope of the application or increases the density, height, traffic, or other feature that affects the operation of the development or its impact on the community. The town council shall resolve whether or not a proffer amendment is substantial. 
d.  If the general nature of the substantially amended proffer was not the subject of earlier consideration at the planning commission's public hearing, as evidenced by information in the staff report, testimony of the applicant or public or statements by planning commission members, then the town council shall refer the application to the planning commission for review and recommendation following another public hearing, prior to rescheduling its public hearing.

e.  Once conditions have been approved, and there is cause for an amendment to the conditions due to proposed development that is not in substantial conformity with the conditions, then an application shall be filed for a zoning map amendment. 
f.  In order to ensure compliance with the requirements proffered by the applicant and owner under this section, the zoning administrator shall be vested with necessary authority on behalf of the town council to administer and enforce conditions attached to the zoning map amendment, including:

Failure to meet all conditions shall constitute cause to deny issuance of any of the required use, occupancy or zoning permits as may be appropriate.

A decision by the town council on an appeal taken pursuant to this subsection shall be binding upon the owner of the property which is the subject of such appeal only if the owner of such property has been provided written notice of the zoning violation, written determination, or other appealable decision. An aggrieved party may petition the county circuit court for review of the decision of the town council on an appeal taken pursuant to this section. The provisions of subsection F of Code of Virginia § 15.2-2285 shall apply to such petitions to the circuit court, mutatis mutandis.

(h)  Subsequent development . Development authorized by the variance shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured other permits required by this chapter or any other applicable provisions of the town. A variance, in itself, shall not ensure that the development approved as a variance shall receive subsequent approval for other applications for development approval. 
(i)  Effect . Issuance of a variance shall authorize the particular variance that is approved in the permit. A variance, including any conditions, shall run with the land and not be affected by a change in ownership. 
(j)  Amendment . A variance may be amended, extended, or eliminated in accordance with the procedures and standards established for its original approval.

Sec. 78-155.9. - Calculation of density/intensity credit. 
(a)  Density/intensity credit . In cases where fee simple title to real estate within a lot or parcel is needed by the town for a public purpose, and the landowner, through police power or through condemnation power, dedicates or conveys this real estate to the town, the town shall provide a density or intensity (floor area ratio), or both credit to the landowner proportional to that area conveyed for the public purpose to the remaining otherwise still developable land. Where the remaining land is not otherwise still developable, the town must, under condemnation law, acquire the whole lot or parcel. In other such cases, where none of a parcel to be acquired is developable, no density/intensity credit shall be granted. No such dedication or conveyance results in or increases a nonconformity of the lot or parcel or structure on the land retained by the landowner. Any resulting setback or yard determinations shall be measured from the post-conveyance land configuration with necessary changes to carry out the principle in the previous sentence. The town grants the credit in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  Approval and recordation . There is approval of density/intensity credit prior to the recordation of the deed, dedication, or conveyance among the county's land records by: 
a.  The town council in approving a rezoning or special exception application when dedication or conveyance is part of such application; or 
b.  The subdivision administrator in approving a subdivision plat in accordance with the subdivision ordinance or the zoning administrator in approving a site plan in accordance with this chapter, when dedication or conveyance is part of such subdivision plat or site plan; or 
c.  The town manager or designee when such dedication or conveyance is not proposed as part of the approval of a rezoning, special exception, subdivision plat, or site plan. 
(2)  Computation of credit . The density/intensity credit shall be computed by determining the (i) density or intensity for the lot or parcel that by right or by accepted proffer would be available to the landowner without the dedication, conveyance, or condemnation and the (ii) density or intensity for the lot or parcel that would be available to the landowner after the dedication, conveyance, or condemnation. The difference between element (i) and (ii) in the previous sentence represents the density/intensity credit allocated to the lot or parcel. The zoning administrator shall determine and certify in writing the density/intensity credit for the lot or parcel and shall file this certificate in the office of the town clerk. 
(3)  Required plat . Prior to dedication, conveyance, or condemnation, the landowner shall submit to the town a plat of dedication, prepared by the town in case of use of condemnation powers. The plat shall show the land area to be dedicated, conveyed, or condemned, the resultant lot or parcel and the appropriate density/intensity allocations by the town council, zoning administrator, subdivision administrator, or town manager, as appropriate. Such plat and an accompanying deed or other instrument providing for a dedication or conveyance to the town for public use shall be recorded among the land records of the county, and shall specifically reserve the density/intensity credit to the remainder of the lot or parcel. Thereafter, any reallocation of such density/intensity credit shall require a resubmission to and approval by the town council, zoning administrator, subdivision administrator, or town manager, as appropriate. 
(4)  No monetary compensation if density/intensity credit accepted . The area to be dedicated or conveyed will be deeded to the town and such dedication or conveyance will not be in exchange for monetary compensation. Nothing in this section shall diminish or affect a landowner's right to reject the provisions of this section and to seek to receive just compensation for real estate taken or acquired by the town using powers of condemnation. 
(5)  Credit runs with the land . A density/intensity credit in accordance with this paragraph shall run with the land remaining after such dedication, conveyance, or condemnation. 
(6)  Not a subdivision or lot line adjustment . Unless growing out of a formal subdivision or lot line adjustment, such dedication or conveyance shall not be treated as a subdivision or lot line adjustment. 
(7)  Effective after January 1, 2011 . A density/intensity credit in accordance with this paragraph shall be applicable to lots or parcels having dedicated, conveyed, or through condemnation provided real estate to the town from January 1, 2011 and afterwards.

(d)  Level of service (LOS) criteria . Prior to approval of proposed development, the 
(1)  Standard met . The proposed development does not cause the level of service for any signalized intersection located within the traffic impact area to be lower than "LOS D."; and no individual turning movement level of service at an intersection falls below "LOS E." 
(2)  Standard not met and remedy proposed. The proposed development does cause an intersection or intersections within the designated traffic impact area to fall below "LOS D," or an individual turning movement level of service does fall below "LOS E." In such case, to address the level of service, the applicant provides guarantees that associated street improvements will be constructed or in place to bring the affected intersections to "LOS D" by the time the impacts from the development occur. 
(3)  Existing level of service . The traffic impact study shall identify those improvements needed to maintain the existing level of service, and what additional improvements would be needed to raise the level of service to the standards indicated.

Sec. 78-160. - Nonconformities. 
    The following sections contain provisions for nonconforming uses and structures. 1 [] 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Footnotes: 
--- () --- 
Editor's note- The ordinance from which this chapter was derived shall be effective on and after the date of its adoption and shall apply (where it does so apply) to rights in existence on and after October 26, 1971. The town council intends that the ordinance from which this chapter was derived apply retroactively to clarify, preserve and support zoning rights that were in existence on and after (or that have come into existence since) October 26, 1971. If any part of Ordinance No. 97-O-32, adopted December 9, 1997, should be declared invalid, unconstitutional or unenforceable, this declaration shall not affect the remaining parts of Ordinance No. 97-O-32. The remaining parts of Ordinance No. 97-O-32 in that case shall continue in force. 

Sec. 78-160.1. - Generally. 
(a)  Purpose and intent . It is the town council's intent to protect vested rights from impairment, while at the same time to provide for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures, and nonconforming lots, to achieve eventual conformance with the policies of the town council as expressed in this chapter. 
(b)  Limitations on nonconformities . Nonconformities are not supposed to be perpetuated, renewed or replaced. Nonconformities should not be extended, enlarged or rendered more permanent, and shall be brought into compliance with this chapter upon the elimination of the nonconformity. 
(c)  Adaptive reuse . The town council intends to allow the adaptive reuse and convenient and efficient utilization of structures in the heritage preservation districts and other older areas that may have been developed under different standards, by allowing some flexibility in the treatment of nonconformities where the specific nonconformity is not increased. 
(d)  Interpretation of unlawful versus nonconforming . Any use, lot, parcel or structure that was unlawful on the date of the enactment of this chapter, October 26, 1971, or amendment thereto, shall remain unlawful and shall not enjoy the status of a nonconforming use, nonconforming structure or nonconforming lot. 
(e)  Nonconforming status runs with land . Nonconforming status shall adhere to the land and shall not be personal to the owner, tenant or possessor of land. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-160.2. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Continuation of nonconforming use . Continuation of a nonconforming use shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  Time of nonconformity . A nonconforming use may continue as it existed when it became nonconforming. 
(2)  Partial use of structure . A nonconforming use within a part of a structure shall not affect the status of uses in the remaining part of the structure. 
(b)  Accessory uses not basis for nonconforming status . A use that is accessory or incidental to a permitted principal use cannot be made the basis for a nonconforming principal use. Therefore, no use, including signage, accessory to a principal nonconforming use, shall continue after such principal use terminates, except as may be approved under section 78-160.2(e)(6), change of a nonconforming use to a different nonconforming use that decreases the degree of nonconformity. 
(c)  Discontinuance of nonconforming use . Discontinuing a nonconforming use may result in loss of nonconforming status subject to the following: 
(1)  Two year discontinuance . If any nonconforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of two years or more, or is changed to or replaced by a conforming use, it shall lose its nonconforming status, except as provided in section 78-160.2(e)(6), change of a nonconforming use to a different nonconforming use that decreases the degree of nonconformity. Any subsequent use shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Accessory or incidental use . Operation of only an accessory or incidental use to the principal nonconforming use during the two-year period shall not continue the principal nonconforming use. 
(d)  Changes to nonconforming uses, generally. Changes to nonconforming uses shall only be permitted subject to the following general provisions; adherence to more specific provisions in this article may also be required. 
(1)  Loss of status . Changes not permitted under the standards of this article shall cause loss of nonconforming use status and shall meet the applicable provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Conforming use . A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use. 
(3)  Lot limitations . No nonconforming use shall be expanded or moved to any other lot or within the lot on which it exists unless such lot is zoned to permit the use. 
(4)  Decrease in nonconformity . A nonconforming use may change to a different nonconforming use that decreases the degree of nonconformity, as set forth in section 78-160.2(e)(6). 
(5)  Permitted changes and required approvals . A nonconforming use, or the structure in which it exists, may be changed, altered, structurally altered, repaired, restored, replaced, relocated or expanded without loss of nonconforming use status only in accordance with this article and the specific provisions of section 78-160.2(e), and subject to the appropriate approvals, including building permit approval, and zoning inspection approval. 
(e)  Specific provisions for changes to nonconforming uses. Permitted changes to nonconforming uses shall be subject to the following specific provisions: 
(1)  Repairs . A conforming or nonconforming structure housing a nonconforming use may be repaired, provided that such repair constitutes only routine maintenance necessary to keep the structure in the same general condition it was in when the use originally became nonconforming. Inherently unsafe nonconforming uses, or the structures housing those uses, may be restored or replaced, where otherwise allowed by law. 
(2)  Minor alterations . Minor alterations, cosmetic modifications, interior renovations, and similar nonstructural changes to an existing structure housing a nonconforming use may be permitted subject to the following standards: 
a.  Such changes shall not increase the land area occupied by any aspect of the nonconforming use, and shall not increase the gross floor area of any structure that is the site of a nonconforming use; and 
b.  Such construction shall meet all current requirements of this chapter. 
(3)  Expansion and other alterations . A nonconforming use occupying an existing structure may expand or be altered only in accordance with the following provisions: 
a.  An existing conforming or nonconforming structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in accordance with sections 78-160.2(d) through 78-160.2(e), and 
b.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a structure which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of this chapter, October 26, 1971, or amendment thereto. Such use shall not be extended to occupy any land outside the structure, except accessory uses that do not compound the nonconforming uses shall be allowed under section 78-155.8 and section 78-150.6(e) of this chapter. 
(4)  Restoration of a nonconforming use damaged by casualty . A structure housing a nonconforming use damaged by casualty (as distinguished from ordinary wear and tear) may be restored in accordance with the following provisions: 
a.  Restoration of a structure housing a nonconforming use shall require approval as set forth in section 78-155.8 or section 78-150.6(e), whichever is appropriate, of this chapter. 
b.  A structure housing a nonconforming use that is damaged by any casualty to an extent of 50 percent or less of its assessed value (exclusive of foundation) at the time of the casualty according to the records maintained by the county department of tax administration, may be restored to its condition prior to the casualty. Such restoration shall be begun within 12 months of the date of the casualty and completed within 24 months of the date of the casualty. 
c.  The restoration shall not include any expansion unless approved under the provisions of section 78-160.2(d) through 78-160.2(e). Such restoration may include changes that make the use less nonconforming than it was prior to the casualty. 
d.  A structure housing a nonconforming use that is damaged by any casualty to an extent more than 50 percent of its assessed value (exclusive of foundations) at the time of the casualty according to the records maintained by the county department of tax administration, shall not be restored except as follows: 
1.  Restoration shall be permitted to a conforming use. 
2.  If the use is as a single-family detached or single-family attached dwelling, restoration shall be permitted, provided such restoration is begun within 12 months of the date of the casualty and completed within 24 months of the date of the casualty, and the dwelling occupies the same space that it occupied prior to such casualty. In no instance shall such structure be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling units than such structure accommodated prior to any such work. 
e.  In the floodplain overlay district, the modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement that amounts to less than 50 percent of its market value is elevated or flood proofed or both to the greatest extent possible. 
(5)  Change to nonconforming use in structures located within the floodplain overlay district . The use of land and use of structures housing nonconforming uses within the floodplain overlay district are subject to the limitations of this subsection: 
a.  Existing structures in a floodway area, zone A1-A30, or zone AE, shall not be expanded or enlarged unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed expansion would not result in any increase in the 100-year flood elevation. 
b.  Within the floodplain overlay district, existing structures and/or uses shall not be expanded or enlarged unless the effect of the proposed expansion or enlargement on flood heights is fully offset as part of the improvements, such that there is no net flood height increase resulting from the expansion or enlargement. 
(6)  Change to a different nonconforming use that decreases degree of nonconformity . A nonconforming use may change to a different nonconforming use that decreases the degree of nonconformity or a conforming use, upon issuance by the zoning administrator or his designee of a written approval for such a change in accordance with the following provisions: 
a.  The approval shall include a determination that the proposed use is more restricted than the existing nonconforming use. If the zoning administrator or his designee determines the proposed use is not more restricted than the existing nonconforming use, the application shall be denied. 
b.  In determining whether a proposed use decreases the degree of nonconformity, the following factors among others shall be considered: 
1.  Whether the proposed use will change the size, type and scope of the existing use; 
2.  Whether the proposed use will increase the intensity of the nonconforming use, including hours of operations, traffic, noise, and similar visual impacts; 
3.  Whether the proposed use will have a more or less detrimental effect on conforming uses in the surrounding area; and 
4.  Whether the proposed use would require more parking. A more restricted nonconforming use shall never be a use which requires more parking than the existing nonconforming use. 
c.  In the issuance of an approval to change to a conforming use or to a different nonconforming use that decreases the degree of nonconformity, the procedures, set forth in section 78-155.8 or section 78-150.6(e), whichever is appropriate, of this chapter shall be followed. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-160.3. - Nonconforming structures. 
(a)  Relationship with nonconforming uses . Where a nonconforming structure is the site of a nonconforming use, the regulations for nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses shall both be applied. In case of conflict, the rules for nonconforming uses shall prevail. 
(b)  Continuation . A nonconforming structure may continue as it existed when it became nonconforming, as long as it is maintained in its then structural condition. 
(c)  Special status for certain nonconforming structures . Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter to the contrary, if (i) the town has issued a building permit, the building or structure was thereafter constructed in accordance with the building permit, and upon completion of construction, the town issued a certificate of occupancy or a use permit therefor, or (ii) the owner of the building or structure has paid taxes to the town for such building or structure for a period of more than the previous 15 years, such building or structure is not illegal and subject to removal solely due to such nonconformity. Such building or structure shall be nonconforming. Such building or structure shall be brought in compliance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code, provided that to do so shall not affect the nonconforming status of such building or structure. 
(d)  Changes to nonconforming structures, generally . Changes to nonconforming structures shall only be permitted subject to the following general provisions; adherence to more specific provisions in this article may also be required. 
(1)  Loss of status . Changes to nonconforming structures not permitted under the standards of this article shall cause loss of nonconforming structure status and shall meet the applicable provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Conforming structure . A nonconforming structure may be changed to a conforming structure by conforming to all requirements of this chapter. 
(3)  Lot limitations . No nonconforming structure shall be moved to any other lot or within the lot on which it exists unless the nonconforming structure is brought into conformity with this chapter. 
(4)  Permitted changes and required approvals . A nonconforming structure may be changed, altered, structurally altered, repaired, restored, replaced, relocated or expanded only in accordance with this section and the specific provisions of section 78-160.3(e) and only with the appropriate approvals, including building permit approval and zoning inspection permit approval. 
(5)  Conflict . This section and the specific provisions of section 78-160.3(e) supplement the provisions of section 78-160.2(a), continuation of nonconforming uses, and shall be read in concert with it. In case of conflict, this section shall prevail. 
(e)  Specific provisions for changes to nonconforming structures . Permitted changes to nonconforming structures shall be subject to the following specific provisions: 
(1)  Repairs . A nonconforming structure may be repaired, provided that such repair constitutes only routine maintenance necessary to keep the structure in the same general condition it was in when it became nonconforming. Inherently unsafe nonconforming structure may be restored or replaced, where otherwise allowed by law. 
(2)  Minor alterations . Minor alterations, cosmetic modifications, interior renovations, and similar nonstructural changes may be permitted subject to the following standards: 
a.  Such changes shall not increase the land area occupied by any aspect of the nonconforming use, and shall not increase the gross floor area of any structure that is the site of a nonconforming use; and 
b.  Such construction shall meet all current requirements of this chapter. 
(3)  Expansion and other alterations . A nonconforming structure may expand or be altered only in conformance with the following provisions: 
a.  A nonconforming structure may be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, altered or structurally altered in ways that do not increase or intensify the elements of nonconformity, under the procedures of section 78-155.8 or section 78-150.6(e) or if applicable, section 78-155.6 of this chapter. 
b.  The nonconforming structure shall be brought into conformity with this chapter, including the parking requirements set out in Article X of this chapter, whenever the nonconforming structure is enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered, in such a way that increases or intensifies the elements of nonconformity. 
(4)  Restoration of a nonconforming structure damaged by casualty (excluding "Acts of God" or natural disaster) . A nonconforming structure damaged by casualty (as distinguished from ordinary wear and tear) may be restored in accordance with the following provisions: 
a.  A nonconforming structure that is damaged by any casualty (excluding natural disaster or other act of God) to an extent of 50 percent or less of its assessed value (exclusive of foundations) at the time of the casualty according to the records maintained by the county department of tax administration may be restored to its condition prior to the casualty, provided that such restoration is begun within 12 months of the date of the casualty and completed within 24 months of the date of the casualty. For developments containing multiple buildings that are not assessed individually by the county department of tax administration, the total assessed value of all buildings on the property shall be used when calculating whether or not any casualty damage is equivalent to 50 percent or less. 
b.  The restoration shall not include any expansion unless approved under the provisions of sections 78-160.3(b) and 78-160.3(d). Such restoration may include changes that make the structure less nonconforming than it was prior to the casualty. 
c.  A nonconforming structure that is damaged by any casualty to an extent more than 50 percent of its assessed value (exclusive of foundations) at the time of the casualty according to the records maintained by the county department of tax administration shall not be restored except as follows: 
1.  Restoration shall be permitted to a conforming structure. 
2.  If the nonconforming structure is within the heritage preservation district, or is designed and used as a single-family detached or single-family attached dwelling and such single-family detached or single-family attached use is allowed in the zoning district in which the nonconforming structure exists, restoration of such structures shall be permitted. The restoration shall begin within 12 months of the date of the casualty and shall be completed within 24 months of the casualty. The structure shall occupy the same space that it occupied prior to such casualty. In no instance shall any residential structure covered by this subsection 78-160.3(e)(4) be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling units than such structure accommodated prior to any such work. 
d.  Restoration of a nonconforming structure shall necessitate approval as set forth in section 78-155.8 or section 78-150.6(e), of this chapter. 
e.  The reconstruction of preexisting buildings or structures destroyed or damaged by casualty is allowed, provided the reconstruction is in the same location and creates no more impervious area than the preexisting building or structure. 
f.  For purposes of this section, owners of property damaged by an accidental fire have the same rights to rebuild such property as if it were damaged by an act of God and shall be subject to the provisions of section 78-160.3(e)(5). Nothing herein shall be construed to enable the property owner to commit an arson under Code of Virginia, § 18.2-77 or § 18.2-80, and obtain vested rights under this section. 
(5)  Restoration of a nonconforming structure after damage by a natural disaster or other act of God . 
a.  The owner of any residential structure or commercial building damaged or destroyed by a casualty or act of God is permitted to repair, rebuild, or replace such building or structure to eliminate or reduce the nonconforming features to the extent possible, as determined by the zoning administrator using the standards in this chapter. Such owner may take such a step without the need to obtain a variance as provided in Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2310. If such building or structure is damaged greater than 50 percent of its market value and cannot be repaired, rebuilt or replaced in accordance with the standards of this chapter, as determined by the zoning administrator using the standards in this chapter, the owner shall have the right to restore the structure or building to its original nonconforming condition. 
b.  The owner shall apply for a building permit and any work done to repair, rebuild or replace such building shall be in compliance with the provisions of the Uniform Statewide Building Code (Code of Virginia § 36-98 et seq.), and any work done to repair, rebuild or replace such building shall be in compliance with the provisions of the flood plain regulations adopted as a condition of participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. These provisions are found in section 78-60.2 of this chapter. 
c.  Unless such building is repaired or rebuilt within two years of the date of the natural disaster or replaced within two years of the date of the natural disaster or other act of God, such building shall only be repaired, rebuilt or replaced in accordance with the provisions of section 78-160.3(e)(4)b. of this chapter. However, if the nonconforming building is in an area under a federal disaster declaration and the building has been damaged or destroyed as a direct result of conditions that gave rise to the declaration, then the owner of the building shall have an additional two years from the date of the natural disaster for the building to be repaired, rebuilt or replaced as otherwise provided in this section. 
(6)  Change to nonconforming structures located within the floodplain overlay district (FPO) . Nonconforming structures within the floodplain overlay district are subject to the additional standards of this subsection: 
a.  In the floodplain overlay district, the modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement that amounts to less than 50 percent of its market value shall be elevated or flood proofed or both to the greatest extent possible. 
b.  If the structure in the floodplain overlay district is designed and used as a single-family detached dwelling that is a permitted use in the zoning district pursuant to Table 78-70.2(d): Table of Principal and Permitted Allowed Uses, it may be restored in its location prior to casualty so long as: 
1.  The restoration is begun within 12 months and completed within 24 months of the casualty; 
2.  The modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement is elevated or flood proofed or both to the greatest extent possible; 
3.  The structure occupies the same space it occupied prior to the casualty; and

(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-160.4. - Nonconforming lots. 
(a)  Lots predating the zoning chapter . Lots existing prior to adoption of the town zoning ordinance shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  Conforming structures on a nonconforming lot . Structures on a nonconforming lot are not, by virtue of being located on a nonconforming lot, nonconforming structures. Such structures maybe continued, enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered in such a way that does not increase the nonconformity of the lot or any nonconformity of the structure and in such a way that is consistent with the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  Use of improved lots existing before October 26, 1971 . If, in a residential zoning district an improved lot (excluding outlots) was part of a subdivision or division of land evidenced by plat or deed, or both, recorded prior to October 26, 1971, the effective date of this chapter, then such lot, either as a single lot, or in combination with other lots accomplished by lot line adjustment under section 70-206 of this Code, may be used, developed, redeveloped on the same footprint after casualty, for any currently or prospectively permitted use in the applicable zoning district. This use, development or redevelopment after casualty may take place even though the lot does not meet applicable minimum lot area or lot width requirements, provided that all other requirements of this chapter shall be satisfied. 
(3)  Use of unimproved lots existing before October 26, 1971. If, in a residential zoning district an unimproved lot (excluding outlots) was part of a subdivision or division of land evidenced by plat or deed, or both, recorded prior to October 26, 1971, the effective date of this chapter, then such lot, either as a single lot, or in combination with other lots accomplished by lot line adjustment under section 70-206 of this Code, may be developed for any currently permitted use in the applicable zoning district upon the town council's issuance of a conditional use permit for such development. This development may take place even though the lot does not meet applicable minimum lot area or lot width requirements, provided that all other requirements of this chapter shall be satisfied. 
(4)  Lots rezoned or subdivided after December 9, 1997 . Subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall not apply to any lot which after the effective date of this section, December 9, 1997, is rezoned or subdivided at the request of the owner, except this last clause shall not apply to reduction in lot area or lot width resulting from a governmental acquisition of a portion of the lot for a public purpose. 
(5)  Use of nonconforming lot after casualty . Use, redevelopment or redevelopment after casualty of a nonconforming lot or the structures thereon in a manner not permitted by this section is prohibited. 
(b)  Change of nonconforming lot . Nonconforming lots in residential zoning districts may change as follows: 
(1)  Lot line adjustment to reduce nonconformity . A nonconforming lot may be increased in lot size, lot width, or both, to make the lot less nonconforming. This action shall be accomplished by a boundary line adjustment under section 70-206 of this Code. 
(2)  Lot line adjustment to nonconforming lot . The boundaries of a lot that is nonconforming as to lot size or lot width, or both, may be adjusted by a lot line adjustment under section 70-206 of this Code, with the boundaries of any contiguous conforming or nonconforming lot, provided that such adjustment does not make the lot or lots more nonconforming, that no new lot is created, and the lot width along the resulting front setback line or lines is not decreased to less than the minimum required within the respective zoning district. 
(3)  Lot line adjustment to create conforming lot . Two or more conforming or nonconforming lots may be assembled to create a conforming lot by a boundary line adjustment under section 70-206 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 17-O-13 , 8-8-2017) 
Sec. 78-160.5. - Changes to nonconforming uses and structures that require changes to site conditions. 
(a)  Change in use causing loss of nonconforming use status may require additional parking. In any change of a nonconforming use which causes a loss of nonconforming use status, any required parking shall be provided under Article X of this chapter only for any marginal increase of parking required for the new use over the parking required for the existing use. Computation of parking required under the existing use and under the new use shall be based on the land or building space subject to change. Any increase in required parking shall be provided in addition to any existing conforming parking. 
(b)  Change in use located in existing nonconforming structure may require additional parking. If the amount of parking provided for a structure is inadequate to meet the requirements of Article X of this chapter, based upon the existing use, then the structure is nonconforming with respect to parking. If the use within such structure is changed, then additional parking which meets the requirements of Article X of this chapter shall be provided only for any marginal increase of parking required for the new use over the parking required for the existing use. Computation of parking required under the existing use and under the new use shall be based on the land or building space subject to change. Any increase in required parking shall be provided in addition to any existing conforming parking. 
(c)  Correction of landscaping, parking, and buffering upon expansion of a nonconforming use or nonconforming structure in a business district . If the amount of parking, landscaping, or buffering or screening provided for a structure or use in a business zoning district is inadequate to meet the requirements of Article V, Development Standards, based upon the existing use, the structure or use is nonconforming with respect to parking, landscaping, or buffering or screening. The expansion of such structures and uses shall be subject to the following standards for parking, landscaping, buffering, screening and lighting: 
(1)  Expansions resulting in less than a 75 percent increase in gross square footage. Expansions that result in less than a 75 percent increase in gross square footage of the existing structure(s) require that parking, landscaping, screening, buffering and lighting be improved a rate equivalent to: 
2 X (percentage increase in gross square footage of the existing structures) = Percentage of correction of nonconformity for parking, landscaping, screening, buffering and lighting.  
(For example, if the addition is 25 percent of the size of the existing building and the site contains only 50 percent of the required landscaping, 50 percent of the required landscaping for the entire area shall be provided, bringing the landscaping on the site to 100 percent of the total required in Article XI: Development Standards.) Existing landscaping on the site shall be retained or replaced but shall not count toward the required percentage of new landscaping (see section 78-110.5, site landscaping.) 
(2)  Expansions in gross square footage . Expansions resulting in an increase of gross square footage of the existing structure(s) by greater than 75 percent require the site to comply fully with the standards of section 78-110.5, site landscaping. 
(3)  Landscaping and screening on physically constrained lands . Lands physically constrained from complying with these provisions shall comply with the maximum extent practicable for landscaping and screening, as determined by the zoning administrator. No allowance for physically constrained land shall be permitted for the required number of parking spaces.

(2)  Penalties and fines .

Occupancy by any other entity or person shall constitute a violation of this chapter. All dwelling units shall be subject to the following standards: 
(a)  Purpose . Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and as an element of the use of land under this chapter to define and limit appropriate family use of dwelling units, occupancy of dwelling units shall be limited to the maximum number of occupants allowed by this section, to protect against threats to neighborhood quality that can accompany overcrowding of land, or undue density of population in relation to existing or available community facilities caused by excessive occupancy. 
(b)  Occupant defined . For the purposes of this chapter, an "occupant" is defined as a person 18 years of age or older, living or sleeping in a building, or having possession of a space within a building. 
(c)  Maximum occupancy, single-family dwellings . For single-family attached and detached dwellings or two-family dwellings, the maximum number of occupants of each dwelling unit shall not exceed the quotient of the floor area (measured in square feet) of the dwelling unit divided by the number set forth below, rounded up to the next whole number. The maximum occupancy of single-family dwelling units is as follows: 
(1)  Up to 1,500 square feet. For a dwelling with a floor area up to 1,500 square feet, use 300 square feet. 
(2)  Up to 2,100 square feet For a dwelling with a floor area from 1,501 square feet to 2,100 square feet, use 350 square feet. 
(3)  Up to 2,800 square feet. For a dwelling with a floor area from 2,101 square feet to 2,800 square feet, use 400 square feet.

(d)  Maximum occupancy, multi-family. For multi-family dwellings, the maximum number of occupants of each dwelling unit shall not exceed the quotient of the floor area (measured in square feet) of the dwelling unit divided by 200, rounded to the nearest whole number. 
(e)  Excessive occupancy, owner response . An owner of a dwelling unit that occupies or allows the occupancy of a dwelling unit by a number of occupants in excess of the maximum occupancy prescribed shall forthwith lower the occupancy to a level consistent with the limits of this chapter. 
(f)  Excessive occupancy, occupant response . An occupant of a dwelling unit occupied by a number of occupants in excess of the maximum occupancy here prescribed shall forthwith lower the occupancy to a level consistent with the limits of this chapter. 
(g)  Investigation of excessive occupancy . The town manager is authorized to investigate incidences of possible excessive occupancy in the town. In exercising the powers granted by this section, the town manager may inspect buildings according to the procedures set out in Code of Virginia, §§ 19.2-393-19.2-397 (or some comparable, later provisions), with necessary changes, for administrative enforcement, or general law of this commonwealth for criminal enforcement. 
(h)  Injunction to limit occupancy . Upon the town manager's conclusion that there exists excessive occupancy of a dwelling unit, the town manager, on behalf of the town, may seek an injunction to limit, lower or control the number of occupants in the dwelling unit. 
(i)  Conflict between zoning code and building code . This section addresses uses of land including occupancy of dwelling units under the town's zoning powers. Section 10-257, Herndon Town Code and the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code also address occupancy, but as a matter of building maintenance and health. In case of conflict between any of these sources, this section applies to questions of the use of land; as such application is determined by the zoning administrator. Section 10-257, Herndon Town Code or the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code applies to property maintenance or health issues; as such application is determined by the building official.
