PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Pharr, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through October 23, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Charles Vignos, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Donald W. Allee, City Attorney, Ms. Nereyda Morales-Martinez, Assistant City Attorney, and Ms. Dora H. Garza, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Be It Ordained by the Board of City Commissioners of the City of Pharr, Texas: 
    Section 1. The Code entitled "Code of Ordinance, City of Pharr, Texas," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of chapters 1 through 138, each inclusive, and Appendix A, is adopted. 
    Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before October 17, 1995, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are repealed. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be constructed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or police regulation of the City, shall be punished by a fine or penalty of not exceeding $500.00. However, a fine or penalty for the violation of a provision of the Code or an ordinance, rule or police regulation that governs fire safety, zoning or public health and sanitation, including dumping of refuse, may not exceed $2,000.00. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is re-enacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the Board of City Commissioners to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

    Section 7.

    Section 8. The city clerk shall publish this ordinance in accordance with article III, section 8 and 9 of the City Charter. This ordinance shall be effective from and after ten days after such publication.

(a)  By Petition: Whenever a majority of the qualified voters who are citizens of the State of Texas and inhabitants of any territory adjoining the then City limits of the City of Pharr, or in case there are no qualified voters in said territory, then when persons owning a majority in area of the land in said territory, desire the annexation of such territory in Pharr, they may present a written petition to that effect to the Board of Commissioners and shall attach to said petition the affidavit of one (1) or more or their majority of such qualified voters, or in case there are no qualified voters, said affidavit shall be to the effect that there are no qualified voters in said territory and that the persons signing said petition own a majority in area of the land in said territory; and thereupon the Board of Commissioners at a regular session held not sooner than twenty (20) days after the presentation of said petition may schedule a hearing and annex such territory by ordinance, utilizing procedures consistent with the laws consistent with [sic] the State of Texas regarding annexation (V.T.C.A., [Local] Government Code § 43.001 et seq.), and thereafter the said territory shall be part of Pharr, and the inhabitants thereof shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of other citizens and shall be bound by the acts, ordinances, resolutions and regulations of said city. 
(b)  By the Board of Commissioners: The Board of Commissioners shall have power by ordinance to fix the boundary limits of Pharr; and to provide for the extension of said boundary limits and the annexation of additional territory lying adjacent to said City, with or without the consent of the territory and inhabitants annexed. Such notice and hearing as are required by the laws of the State of Texas regarding annexation shall be provided prior to institution of annexation proceedings and passage of any ordinance annexing such territory. The territory so annexed shall be a part of Pharr, and the inhabitants thereof shall be entitled to all rights and privileges of other citizens and shall be found [bound] by the acts, ordinances, resolutions and regulations of said city. 
(c)  There shall be set forth in every ordinance in and by which territory is annexed to the City of Pharr a clear and definite description of the territory annexed, either by metes and bounds, or otherwise, so as to clearly and definitely define the same, but it shall not be necessary to embody such description in the title or caption of such ordinance. 
(d)  All territory annexed to the City of Pharr under the provisions of this Section shall become and be thereafter liable for all just and legal indebtedness of the city, without reference to when such debts were contracted, and the Board of Commissioners shall have the power to provide for the assessment and collection of taxes upon all property within such annexed territory to meet any such indebtedness, on the same basis as other property in the city. 
(e)  Whenever there exists within the corporate limits of the City of Pharr any territory contiguous to such city limits, not suitable or necessary for city purposes, the Board of Commissioners may, upon a petition signed by a majority of the qualified voters residing in such territory, if the same be inhabited, or without any such petition if the same be uninhabited, by ordinance duly passed by a four-fifths vote of all the members of the Board of Commissioners, discontinue said territory as a part of said City. Said petition and ordinance shall specify accurately the metes and bounds of the territory sought to be eliminated from the City and shall contain a plat designating such territory so that the same can be definitely ascertained; and when said ordinance has been duly passed, the same shall be entered upon the minutes and records of said City, and from and after the entry of such ordinance, said territory shall still be liable for its pro rata share of any debts incurred while said area was a part of said City. All taxes levied by the City on property in the area excluded from the boundaries of the City under the provisions hereof, remaining unpaid at the time of said exclusion, and the liens thereof, and the liability of the owners therefor, shall continue in full force and effect and be collectable and enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as if said property had remained within and as a part of said City. The Board of Commissioners shall determine, at the time of the exclusion of said area from the City, what unpaid debts of the City said excluded territory is liable for, and shall determine the pro rata part of said indebtedness which shall be that portion thereof that the assessed valuation of property in the excluded area bears to the total assessed valuation of property in the City as a whole, according to the latest assessment roll of the City, and the property in said excluded area shall remain subject to annual taxation by the City for the payment of the pro rata part of said indebtedness for which the property in said excluded area is liable, determined as herein provided, until the entire amount of such pro rata part of said indebtedness shall have been paid. All taxes assessed against the property in said excluded area for the payment of its pro rata part of said indebtedness shall be credited upon the amount of said indebtedness for which said excluded area remains liable; provided that the owners of the taxable property in said excluded area may at any time discharge said property from any further liability for said indebtedness by paying in a lump sum the then unpaid portion of said indebtedness for which the property in said excluded area remains liable. In the event of such payment and discharge for such unpaid portion of said indebtedness, the Board of Commissioners shall execute a recordable instrument, in writing, evidencing such payment and discharge.

(f)  At each meeting, each committee member shall sign an attendance sheet which indicates that the member does not have a conflict of interest with any item on that agenda, or identifies each agenda item on which the member has a conflict of interest. Failure to sign the sheet results in the member being counted as absent and his/her votes are not counted. 
(g)  A committee member who seeks to resign from the committee shall submit a written resignation to the chairman. If possible, the resignation should allow for a 30-day notice so the committee of commissioners can appoint a replacement.

(k)  The city clerk shall retain agendas, approved minutes, internal review reports and bylaws. The parks and recreation department shall retain all other committee documents. The documents are public records under V.T.C.A., Govt. Code ch. 552 (Texas Public Information Act). 
(l)  Each person and committee member attending a committee meeting should observe proper decorum. 
(m)  Debate and motions. Motions are usually classified in several ways: 
(1)  Main motion; 
(2)  Subsidiary motion/Un-debatable motions; 
(3)  Privileged motions; and 
(4)  Fully-debatable motions. 
    A main motion is a motion that brings business before the committee. Main motions are made while no other motion is pending. Any of the subsidiary or privileged motions may be made while the main motion is pending, and in many cases these motions, if passed, will affect the committee's consideration of the main motion. A subsidiary or un-debatable motion is a type of motion by which a deliberative assembly deals directly with a main motion prior to (or instead of) voting on the main motion itself. Subsidiary motions are motions such as to postpone indefinitely, amend and to table. 
    A subsidiary or un-debatable motion involves procedural questions that can be resolved without discussion, such as tabling a main motion, moving the previous question, restricting further discussion of a main motion to a fixed number of minutes, postponing action, or referring an item under discussion to a committee. After a subsidiary or un-debatable motion is offered, the chairman must immediately take a vote, without discussion. 
    Privileged motions grant precedence over ordinary business. Such motions have limited debate permitted. They include setting the time of the next meeting, adjourn, recess or executive session. Any discussion of a privileged motion must be addressed to the motion itself. A motion to fix the time for adjourning the commission meeting, for example, might require limited debate as to the advisability of such a decision, but other points of discussion would be out of order. 
    Fully-debatable motions are subject to unlimited discussion prior to a decision. 
    One of the most important principles of debate is that committee member's statements be directly relevant to the item under consideration. Committee members recognized by the chairman are given the floor only for the purpose of discussing the item then pending, and they are out of order if they depart from that item. "Debate" can easily evolve into statements of personal philosophy. As interesting though as these statements may seem to the speaker, such departures do not belong in a commission meeting. 
(Ord. No. 2017-32, 8-21-17) 
Sec. 2-165.3 - Amendment of bylaws. 
    A bylaw amendment is not effective unless approved by the board of commissioners.

(k)  The city clerk shall retain agendas, approved minutes, internal review reports and bylaws. The communications department shall retain all other committee documents. The documents are public records under V.T.C.A., Local Govt. Code ch. 552 (Texas Public Information Act). 
(l)  Each person and committee member attending a committee meeting should observe proper decorum. 
(m)  Debate and motions. Motions are usually classified in several ways: 
(1)  Main motion. A main motion is a motion that brings business before the committee. Main motions are made while no other motion is pending. Any of the subsidiary or privileged motions may be made while the main motion is pending, and in many cases these motions, if passed, will affect the committee's consideration of the main motion. A subsidiary or un-debatable motion is a type of motion by which a deliberative assembly deals directly with a main motion prior to (or instead of) voting on the main motion itself. Subsidiary motions are motions such as to postpone indefinitely, amend and to table. 
(2)  Subsidiary motion/un-debatable motions. A subsidiary or un-debatable motion involves procedural questions that can be resolved without discussion, such as tabling a main motion, moving the previous question, restricting further discussion of a main motion to a fixed number of minutes, postponing action, or referring an item under discussion to a committee. After a subsidiary or un-debatable motion is offered, the chairman must immediately take a vote, without discussion. 
(3)  Privileged motions. Privileged motions grant precedence over ordinary business. Such motions have limited debate permitted. They include setting the time of the next meeting, adjourn, recess or executive session. Any discussion of a privileged motion must be addressed to the motion itself. A motion to fix the time for adjourning the commission meeting, for example, might require limited debate as to the advisability of such a decision, but other points of discussion would be out of order. 
(4)  Fully-debatable motions. Fully-debatable motions are subject to unlimited discussion prior to a decision. 
    One of the most important principles of debate is that committee member's statements be directly relevant to the item under consideration. Committee members recognized by the chairman are given the floor only for the purpose of discussing the item then pending, and they are out of order if they depart from that item. "Debate" can easily evolve into statements of personal philosophy. As interesting though as these statements may seem to the speaker, such departures do not belong in a commission meeting.

(2)  Requested a decision from the city attorney or attorney general in accordance with section 2-248(c), and such decision is pending;

(Ord. No. O-2015-23, § 20, 4-21-15; Ord. No. O-2017-12, § 20, 4-3-17) 
Sec. 18-51. - Quarantine method and testing. 
(a)  When a dog, cat, or domestic ferret that has bitten a human has been identified, the custodian will place the animal (regardless of its vaccination status) in quarantine as defined in the V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code, § 826.002, until the end of the ten-day observation period. 
(b)  The animal must also be quarantined if there is probable cause to believe that it has otherwise exposed a human to rabies. 
(c)  The observation period will begin at the time of the exposure. 
(d)  The animal must be placed in a department-licensed quarantine facility specified by the local rabies control authority and observed at least twice daily. However, the local rabies control authority may allow the animal to be quarantined in a veterinary clinic. As an alternative to quarantine at a department-licensed facility or a veterinary clinic, the local rabies control authority may allow home confinement. 
(e)  To allow home confinement, the following criteria must be met: 
(1)  A secure enclosure approved by the local rabies control authority must be used to prevent escape. 
(2)  The animal has been vaccinated against rabies and the time elapsed since the most recent vaccination has not exceeded the manufacturer recommendations for the vaccine. If an unvaccinated animal is not over 16 weeks of age at the time of the potential exposure, it may be allowed home confinement. 
(3)  During the confinement period, the animal's custodian must monitor the animal's behavior and health status and immediately notify the local rabies control authority if any change is noted. 
(4)  The local rabies control authority or a veterinarian must observe the animal at least on the first and last days of the home confinement. 
(5)  The animal was not a stray as defined in the V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code, § 826.002, at the time of the potential exposure. 
(f)  If the potential rabies exposure described in subsection (b) of this section occurs in a city or county other than where the animal's custodian resides, the animal may be transferred to a department-licensed quarantine facility or a veterinary clinic in the city or county of the custodian's residence or allowed home confinement, if applicable, if there is mutual agreement to do so between the local rabies control authorities for the city or county where the exposure occurred and where the custodian resides. 
(g)  The alternative to quarantining (to include home confining) a dog, cat, or domestic ferret that has bitten or otherwise potentially exposed a person to rabies as described in subsection (a) of this section is to have the animal euthanatized in such a manner that the brain is not damaged and a suitable specimen submitted to a department-designated laboratory for rabies testing. A list of department-designated laboratories may be found on the department's website or may be obtained from any of the department's regional zoonosis control offices. 
(h)  A domestic animal that has potentially exposed a human to rabies and has been designated by the local rabies control authority as unowned may be euthanatized. If the animal is euthanatized, a suitable specimen shall be submitted for rabies testing. 
(i)  "Free-roaming animals" as used in this section includes animals that have been in captivity less than 200 days immediately prior to the potential exposure and those that are not in captivity. If the animal implicated in the potential exposure is a free-roaming high-risk animal, it shall be euthanatized and a suitable specimen submitted for rabies testing. If the animal implicated in the potential exposure is a high-risk animal that has been in captivity without contact with free-roaming animals for 200 days or more immediately prior to the potential exposure or is less than 200 days old, has always been in captivity without contact with free-roaming animals, and is the progeny of a dam that has been in captivity without contact with free-roaming animals for 200 days or more immediately prior to the potential exposure, the local rabies control authority shall conduct a risk assessment to gauge the probability that the animal could have been exposed to rabies and, therefore, poses a public health risk. If the probability that the animal implicated in the potential exposure could have had animal contact conducive to rabies transmission is low and the potential exposure poses a negligible public health risk, the local rabies control authority may require that the animal involved in the potential exposure be quarantined at a department-licensed quarantine facility or a veterinary clinic or confined elsewhere as deemed appropriate by the local rabies control authority for a 30-day observation period as an alternative to euthanatizing and testing. The local rabies control authority or a veterinarian must observe the animal at least on the first and last days of the quarantine or confinement that was deemed appropriate by the local rabies control authority. 
(j)  If the animal implicated in the potential exposure is a low-risk animal, neither quarantine nor rabies testing will be required unless the local rabies control authority has cause to believe the animal is rabid, in which case it shall be euthanatized and a suitable specimen submitted for rabies testing. 
(k)  The local rabies control authority may require an animal that has inflicted multiple bite wounds, punctures, or lacerations to a person to be euthanatized. If the animal is euthanatized, a suitable specimen shall be submitted for rabies testing. 
(l)  If the animal implicated in the potential exposure is not included in subsection (a), (f), (g), (h), (j), or (k) of this section or the portion of subsection (i) of this section pertaining to a free-roaming high-risk animal, the animal either will be euthanatized and a suitable specimen submitted for rabies testing or the local rabies control authority may require the animal to be quarantined at a department-licensed quarantine facility or a veterinary clinic or confined elsewhere as deemed appropriate by the local rabies control authority for the 30-day observation period as an alternative to euthanatizing and testing. The local rabies control authority's decision on whether to quarantine or euthanatize and test those other animals described in subsection (i) of this section will be determined by risk-assessment parameters as described in subsection (i) of this section. If the potential rabies exposure occurs in a city or county other than where the animal's custodian resides, the animal may be transferred to a department-licensed quarantine facility or a veterinary clinic in the city or county of the custodian's residence or allowed confinement deemed appropriate if there is mutual agreement to do so between the local rabies control authorities for the city or county where the exposure occurred and where the custodian resides. During the observation period, the animal's custodian must monitor the animal's behavior and health status and immediately notify the local rabies control authority if any change is noted. The local rabies control authority or a veterinarian must observe the animal at least on the first and last days of the quarantine or confinement that was deemed appropriate by the local rabies control authority. 
(m)  Any animal required to be quarantined under this section that cannot be maintained in secure quarantine shall be euthanatized and a suitable specimen submitted for rabies testing. 
(n)  All laboratory specimens referred to in subsections (g)-(k) of this section shall be submitted in accordance with Texas Administrative Code § 169.33 (relating to submission of specimens for laboratory examination). 
(o)  At the discretion of the local rabies control authority, assistance animals may not be required to be placed in quarantine (to include confinement) during the observation period. During the applicable observation period, the animal's custodian must monitor the animal's behavior and health status and immediately notify the local rabies control authority if any change is noted. The local rabies control authority or a veterinarian must observe the animal at least at the beginning and on the last day of the applicable observation period. 
(p)  Police service animals are exempted from quarantine per the V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code, § 826.048, including confinement. During the applicable observation period, the animal's custodian must monitor the animal's behavior and health status and immediately notify the local rabies control authority if any change is noted. 
(q)  Animals should not be vaccinated against rabies or receive other vaccinations or non-essential medications that may complicate assessment of behavioral change or health status during the observation period; however, animals may be treated for medical problems that are diagnosed by a veterinarian and are not related to rabies. If the animal becomes ill during the observation period, the local rabies control authority must be notified by the person having possession of the animal.

If such buildings are unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the building. If such entry is refused, or if the owner or other person having charge or control of the premises cannot be found, then the inspector or building official shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to gain entry, as through an inspection warrant. 
(d)  The city shall inspect a representative sample, as determined by the city, of those individual dwelling units specified in the most recent multi-family license application.

(5)  Embodiment of elements of architectural design, detail, materials or craftsmanship which represent a significant architectural innovation; 
(6)  Relationship to other distinctive buildings, sites, or areas which are eligible for preservation according to a plan based on architectural, historic or cultural motif;

(9)  Identification with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the culture and development of the city, state or nation; and 
(10)  Value, as an aspect of community sentiment, public pride, local identity or humble origins of an established visual feature that may be ordinary or familiar, but which has acquired significance in its own right. 
(c)  Criteria for approval of a certificate of appropriateness. 
(1)  Prohibition. No person or entity shall carry out any construction, reconstruction, restoration, alteration, rehabilitation, relocation, removal or demolition of any historic landmark, any property within a historic district, any exterior architectural feature of a designated historic landmark, or a district's building, nor shall any person make any material change in the light fixtures, signs, sidewalks, fences, paving, or other exterior elements visible from a public right-of-way which affect the appearance and cohesiveness of any historic landmark or any property within a historic district, unless a certificate of appropriateness is granted. As used in this article, the term "exterior architectural feature" shall include, but not be limited to, architectural style and general arrangement of such portion of the exterior of a structure as is designed to be open to view from a public way. 
(2)  General. The commission shall render a decision on the certificate of appropriateness within 90 days after the date on which the commission's agenda is posted, except as provided for below. When considering applications for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall consider several factors including, but not limited to: the purpose behind preserving the structure as a historic landmark, the state of repair of the building, the reasonableness of the cost of restoration or repair, the existing and/or potential usefulness of the building, including its economic usefulness, the character of the neighborhood, and all other factors it finds appropriate. 
(3)  Guidelines. When reviewing applications for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall be guided by any adopted design guideline (e.g. preservation plan, and architectural standards), and where applicable, the following from the secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation of historic buildings. Any adopted design guidelines and secretary of the interior's standards shall be made available to the property owners of historic landmarks or within historic districts. 
a.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to adapt the property in a manner which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, object, or site and its environment. 
b.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, object, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
c.  All buildings, structures, objects, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
d.  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, object, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
e.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, object, or site shall be kept where possible. 
f.  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should reflect the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
g.  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic buildings' materials shall not be undertaken. 
h.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.

j.  Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to buildings, structures, objects, or sites shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the building, structure, object, or site would be unimpaired. 
(d)  Procedures for certificates of appropriateness. 
(1)  Application. Prior to the commencement of any work requiring a certificate of appropriateness the owner shall file an application for such certificate with the commission. The certificate of appropriateness required by this article shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any building permit that may be required by any other ordinance of the city. The application shall contain: 
a.  Name, address, telephone number of applicant, detailed description of the nature, character, and reason for the proposed work. 
b.  Location and historical photograph (if any) of the property and adjacent properties. 
c.  Elevation drawings of the proposed changes, if available. 
d.  Samples of materials to be used.

f.  Any other information which the commission may deem necessary in order to visualize the proposed work. 
(2)  Written orders. From and after the date on which the presiding officer of the commission by 'written order' directs that any building, structure, site or district within the city be placed upon the agenda for any special or regular meeting of the commission or any committee thereof for any purpose including, but not limited to consideration or discussion on whether or not same should be designated an historic landmark and hence be issued a certificate of appropriateness, or from and after the date that the commission or the city commission thereof approves or recommends an ordinance, or a preservation plan or any amendment of any existing preservation plan, or ordinance which embraces or includes same building, structure, or site within the city, whichever date first occurs, no building permit allowing the relocation, or the construction, reconstruction, restoration, alteration, rehabilitation, or demolition of any exterior architectural feature of any building or structure then existing included or embraced in whole or in part within the scope of such 'written order' or such agenda or such preservation plan or such amendment thereof, as the case may be, and no permit allowing the relocation, demolition or removal of all or any part of any such building or structure, may be issued by any official of the city. Similarly, when building permits are neither sought nor required, no person or entity may commence any work whatsoever on same building or structure upon the issuance of a 'written order'. 
It shall be the duty of the city and its officers to furnish the building official with a copy of such 'written order' or such preservation plan, ordinance or amendments thereof, as the case may be, as promptly after the preparation thereof as is practicable. The failure to so furnish the building official with a copy or written notice thereof, however, shall not have the effect of validating any permit whatsoever issued in ignorance of any such written order or agenda. 
In any instance in which any such permit may not be required, it shall be the duty of the commission and its officers to give notice of any such 'written order' or such preservation plan, ordinance or amendments thereof to the owner or owners of any building or structure included within the scope thereof, which notice shall be deemed complete when actually given, orally or in writing, to such owner or owners, or when written notice thereof is deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, certified or registered, with return receipt requested, addressed to such owner or owners, whichever event first occurs. 
No person or entity to whom such permit is issued or who, if no such permit is required, commences to construct, reconstruct, significantly restore or alter, remove or demolish any exterior architectural feature of any such building or structure without actual or constructive notice of any such 'written order', or such preservation plan or amendment thereof, as the case may be, as required by the provisions of this subsection, may be found guilty of a misdemeanor as provided in this article, but each such person or entity shall be amenable to the civil sanctions provided for by this article. 
Any permit issued to any person or entity from or after the date of any such 'written order', or the approval or recommendation of such preservation plan, ordinance or amendments thereof, as the case may be, shall be null, void and of no force or effect until the earliest of the two events described below occur: 
a.  A final and binding certificate of appropriateness, as may be appropriate, has been issued by the commission; 
b.  The commission fails to recommend that some part or all of such building or structure be designated an historic landmark or be included within an historic landmark or within a preservation plan, ordinance or amendments thereof within 90 days following the posting date of the commission's agenda. 
(3)  Procedure for building permits, or when building permits are not sought: 
a.  When applying for a building permit for a designated historic landmark, including secondary buildings and landscape features, the applicant shall submit the required application for a certificate of appropriateness to a building official. Any applicant may appear at a regular or special meeting of the commission before submitting an application and may also consult with the commission during the application review; 
b.  When, for whatever reason, a building permit is not sought to perform significant alterations on the exterior of a designated historic landmark including secondary buildings and landscape features, request for an application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be submitted to a building official. Such certificate must be granted before such work may be undertaken. Any applicant may appear at a regular or special meeting of the commission before submitting an application and may consult with the commission during the application review; 
c.  The commission, upon ten days' written notice to the applicant, shall hold a hearing on the application. Upon review of the application, if the commission finds the proposed work (i.e. restoration, rehabilitation, alteration, new construction, reconstruction) will (or will not) adversely affect any significant architectural or historical feature of the designated historic landmark, and is (or is not) appropriate and consistent with the spirit and purposes of this article and with the department of the interior guidelines, it shall (or shall not) issue a certificate of appropriateness within 90 days after the posting date of the commission's agenda, and the building official shall so advise the applicant. Any changes in the application which are necessary to approval of same shall be included; 
Similarly, the commission shall (or shall not) issue a certificate of appropriateness for removal, demolition or relocation as may be appropriate, if it determines that the interest of preserving historical values, a structure should (or should not) be demolished or removed, or relocated to another specified location. 
If there is a desirable purpose to be served by preserving the structure, the commission may, by majority vote, defer action to approve or disapprove the application in order to investigate alternatives to demolition, removal, relocation, or other matters including ordinary maintenance, neglect or omission of repairs (see subsections (d)(4)a.-c., below). Action may be deferred for a specified period not to exceed 90 days beyond the initial 90-day period after the posting date of the commission's agenda. 
After a decision is reached by the commission disapproving an application for a certificate of appropriateness for removal, relocation or demolition, a resubmittal of application for such a certificate will not be accepted for additional hearings within a 12-month period from the date of final decision. 
d.  Ninety-day period. If no action has been taken by the commission within 90 days after the posting date of the commission's agenda, a certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed issued by the commission, except when: 
(1)  The decision involves a certificate of appropriateness for relocation, removal, or demolition, as prescribed above (see subsection (d)(3)c.); and 
(2)  When the commission sends a written recommendation for review by the city planner, who shall so advise the applicant (see subsection (f) below). 
e.  No significant change shall be made in application for any building permit after issuance of a certificate of appropriateness without resubmittal to the commission and approval thereof in the same manner as provided above. 
(4)  Ordinary repair or maintenance: 
a.  General. Ordinary repair or maintenance which does not involve significant changes to the exterior of architectural or historic value, style or general design is exempt from the provisions of this section. 
Designated historic landmarks shall be maintained to ensure the structural soundness of such landmark. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance and repair of any exterior architectural feature of a historic landmark which does not involve a change in design, material, or outward appearance. In-kind replacement or repair is included in this definition or ordinary maintenance. 
b.  Neglect: No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a landmark or included within an historic district shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the judgment of the commission, produce a detrimental effect upon the life and character of the property itself, and the character of the historic district as a whole. Examples of such deterioration include: 
1.  Deterioration or exterior walls or other vertical supports. 
2.  Deterioration of roof or other horizontal members. 
3.  Deterioration of exterior chimneys. 
4.  Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar. 
5.  Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roof, or foundations, including broken windows or doors. 
6.  Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous condition which could lead to the claim that demolition is necessary for the public safety. 
c.  Procedure: If a building official and/or the commission find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a designated historic landmark is structurally unsound, the commission shall issue a 'written order', and notify the owner of record of the designated historic landmark of such fact. 
1.  Upon the giving of ten days' written notice to the owner of record of such designated historic landmark, the building and standards commission shall hold a public hearing to determine if the designated historic building is structurally unsound or in imminent danger of becoming structurally unsound. The building and standards commission shall request a report and consider recommendation from the commission. The commission's report may, as appropriate, include evidence of omission of necessary repairs, and/or willful neglect, or evidence of hardship, etc. 
2.  At the conclusion of the hearing, if the building and standards commission finds that the designated historic building is structurally unsound or in danger of so becoming, the owner of record shall, within 90 days of receipt of such notice, satisfy the building and standards commission that reasonable necessary repairs to safeguard the structural soundness of the landmark have been effected. A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued for that effect. 
3.  If the building and standards commission determines that the building is structurally unsound but there are valid reasons why the owner cannot or should not undertake to safeguard the structural soundness of the building, it shall forward to the Commission its recommendation, as to what action, if any, should be taken on the structure. 
(e)  Appeals. Any applicant or the owner of any property located within 300 feet of the site of any landmark who is aggrieved by a ruling of the commission, or the building and standards commission, concerning the same landmark under the provisions of this section may, within 30 days after the ruling of the commission, appeal in writing to the city secretary. The city council shall give notice, follow publication procedure, hold hearings, and make its decision in the same manner as provided in the zoning ordinance of the city.

(f)  Hardship process. 
(1)  After receiving written notification from the commission of the disapproval of a certificate of appropriateness, or where there are conditions under which the required preservation of a historic landmark would cause undue hardship on the owner or owners, an applicant may commence the hardship process within 30 days. 
Also, applications for a certificate of appropriateness to include or exclude a property may be made when either continued exclusion or inclusion of property within the district would render it an undue hardship for reasonable continuation in its present exterior form. 
In evaluating undue hardship, the commission may request the owner to document the value, rents, returns, tax burden and/or contracts, pertaining to the property, and other pertinent information it deems appropriate. 
(2)  When a claim of hardship is made due to the effect of this article, the owner must prove that: 
a.  The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible; 
b.  No reasonable alternative use exists which allows the exterior of the building to remain in its original style; 
c.  The property cannot be adapted for any other use, including land use, whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return; and 
d.  Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it have failed. 
(3)  The applicant shall consult in good faith with the commission, local preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an alternative that will result in preservation of the property. Such efforts must be substantiated to the commission. 
(4)  Within 90 days after the posting date of the commission's agenda, the commission shall hold a public hearing on the application, and issue a certificate of appropriateness, or, when land use changes are recommended, issue a 'written recommendation' for review by the city planner. The latter shall be governed generally by the city's zoning ordinance, and the following shall apply: 
a.  The commission shall forward its written recommendation to the city planner with the request that a change of land use be set in motion. 
b.  The city planner shall give notice, follow publication procedure, hold hearings, and have the planning and zoning commission and the city council make their decision in the same manner as provided in the zoning ordinance of the city. 
c.  The following specifications shall be taken by the applicant: 
1.  File an application for change in land use, on a form provided by the City of Pharr, and the herein required listing and preaddressed, stamped envelopes with the city planner. On the date of filing, the proposed public hearing date shall be set by the city planner. This date shall not be sooner than ten working days after the filing date. 
2.  Deliver to the city planner a listing of adjacent property owners; with their addresses, i.e., those property owners whose property is within 300 feet of the requesting party's property. 
3.  Deliver to the city planner addressed, stamped envelopes for mailing to the hereinabove set forth adjacent property owners. These envelopes shall contain at a minimum a completed notice of public hearing on a form provided by the City of Pharr. Said form shall be completed by the requesting party.

ARTICLE IX. - MOTOR VEHICLE SALES 

Sec. 26-400. - Purpose and intent. 
    The board of commissioners finds that most motor vehicle businesses within the city are littered with refuse or debris or used unlawfully as repositories of partially dismantled, inoperable, wrecked, junked, or discarded vehicles, thereby creating conditions which attract children and endanger their lives and health; increase vermin and noxious weeds; invite vandals; create fire hazards and other safety and health hazards; create, extend, and aggravate urban blight; interfere with the enjoyment of and reduce the value of surrounding private property; and interfere with the comfort and well-being of the public. The board of city commissioners also find that frequently such motor vehicle businesses are overburdened with many more motor vehicles, both being offered for sale and otherwise, so as to create or aggravate the aforementioned conditions.

Secs. 58-1-58-25. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 58-26. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article it's most reasonable application. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the 1-percent-annual change (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for zones A, AE, AH, A1-30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year, also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building, which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
    Existing construction means, for the purpose of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. Existing construction may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood insurance rate map or FIRM means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS). See flood elevation study. 
    Flood proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source; see definition of flood. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodways. See regulatory floodway. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Habitable floor means any floor usable for the following purposes, which include working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used for storage purposes only is not a habitable floor. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or

b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle" 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as a temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

    Special flood hazard area. See area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348)) includes substantial improvement means the date the building permit was issued; provided that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. 
    Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, where specified, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

    The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 1976, § 12.5-3; Ord. No. O-2017-51, 11-20-17) 
Sec. 58-29. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Sec. 58-80. - Areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 58-31 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified; or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in subsection 58-54(a)(1), are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

ARTICLE II. - CURFEW FOR MINORS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-2013-48, §§ 2-10, adopted Dec. 3, 2013, amended Art. II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. II, §§ 86-31-86-39, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. O-2009-41, §§ 2-10, adopted Oct. 27, 2009. 

Sec. 86-31. - Purpose. 
    This article sets forth regulations for the presence of minors in public places during specified times of day. These regulations encompass prevailing community standards for the purpose of furthering responsible conduct, and advancing family responsibility and of promoting public safety and welfare for all persons. The board of commissioners has determined that a curfew meets a very real need and is a significant factor in protecting juveniles and minimizing juvenile delinquency and promoting the public's health, safety, and welfare. The board of commissioners also finds that there are persons upon the streets of the city who represent an influence that is detrimental to the health, safety, welfare and morals of minors considering their peculiar vulnerability and their inability to make critical decisions in an informed and mature manner and that minors who fall under this influence, in turn, represent a detriment to the health, safety, welfare and morals of the community as a whole and lead to increased crime and fear among citizens for their safety and welfare and that of their minor children. The board of commissioners also finds that commercial recreational facilities are very limited in the city. The curfew hours cited by this article reflect the community standard of the appropriate hour for cessation of outdoor activities by minors in public places. The curfew also takes into account the hours which present the highest risk for nocturnal crimes and for the congregating of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity. Therefore, the board of commissioners finds that this article is necessary and that it serves the community's interest in protecting our minors from criminal and other unhealthy influences. The board of commissioners has determined that parental and community responsibility for the whereabouts of minors is a community norm. As parental and community control increases, the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases. Therefore, legal sanctions to enforce parental and community responsibility has been shown to be significantly effective in minimizing the incidence of juvenile delinquency and in protecting the minors and the community at large. The board of commissioners hereby determines that the curfew for minors will accomplish under local conditions the purposes stated herein. The board of commissioners is mindful that minors in the city have the right to use the public places, streets and ways, to exercise their rights to free speech and association, to travel, to be employed and to be involved in school, church and other association activities and find that any restrictions upon these rights are essential for the purposes set out herein and are limited to meeting the essential needs found herein and are otherwise scrupulously protected herein. It is the desire and intent of the board of commissioners that in assessing penalties for violation of section 86-33 of this article, the court should utilize to the full extent of the law procedures and sentences other than monetary fines to that the minor bears the burden for violation of the ordinance rather than a parent of such minor.

    It shall be unlawful for any person, as defined herein, to knowingly permit or by inefficient control allow such minor to be or remain upon any public place under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise outside the scope of, this article. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that a person should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that person's legal custody. It shall be no defense that a person was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. It shall be a defense to the accusation of unlawful conduct pursuant to this section of this article for the accused person to demonstrate that the person has reported an inability to control the minor to a law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the person's place of residence, establishment, or public place, or to demonstrate that the person has enrolled in any parenting classes at a public or private educational institution.

In following the police department juvenile procedures, a police officer must act in accordance with the Texas Family Code as it is now enacted or may be hereafter amended. In the case of the first violation by a minor, the juvenile officer or other designated police officer shall send to a parent written notice of said violation, by certified mail, with a warning that any subsequent violation may result in enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
(b)  The prohibition enacted by this article shall apply to persons as defined herein. If a police officer takes into custody for violation of this article a minor who is discovered to be under the age of ten years, such minor shall not therefore be accused of unlawful conduct pursuant to this article. Instead, the officer is to release such minor to his or her parent, guardian, custodian or other responsible person as may be authorized as soon as practicable pursuant to the city police department juvenile procedures. This subsection shall not be construed as a defense to prosecution of the parent of such minor charged with an offense.

ARTICLE IV. - IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM 

Sec. 86-61. - Program adoption.

F. R. § 681.2. This program was developed for the utility department of the city ("utility") with oversight and approval of the city commission. After consideration of the size and complexity of the utility's operations and account systems, and the nature and scope of the utility's activities, the city commission determined that this program was appropriate for the city's utility, and therefore approved this program on May 5, 2009. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-16, § I, 5-5-09) 
Sec. 86-62. - Purpose and definitions.

To establish an identity theft prevention program designed to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or an existing covered account and to provide for continued administration of the program in compliance with Part 681 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations implementing Sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) of 2003. 
(b)  Establishing and fulfilling requirements of the Red Flags Rule. The Red Flags Rule ("Rule") defines "identity theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person" and a "red flag" ("red flag") as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft. 
Under the Rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its operation. The program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to: 
(1)  Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; 
(2)  Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; 
(3)  Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 
(4)  Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft. 
(c)  Red Flags Rule definitions used in this program. 
City: The City of Pharr, Texas. 
Covered account: Under the Rule, a "covered account" is: 
(1)  Any account the utility offers or maintains primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions; and 
(2)  Any other account the utility offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the utility from identity theft. 
Creditors: The Rule defines creditors "to include finance companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and telecommunications companies. Where nonprofit and government entities defer payment for goods or services, they, too, are to be considered creditors." 
Identifying information is defined under the Rule as "any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person," including: name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, computer's internet protocol address, or routing code. 
Program: The identity theft prevention program for the city. 
Program administrator: The utility billing and collection manager (Joe Enriquez) is the program administrator for the program.

Sec. 86-66. - Program updates. 
    This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the utility from identity theft.

Sec. 86-67. - Program administration. 
(a)  Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies with the finance department. The program administrator is the utility billing and collection manager. The program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of utility staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program. 
(b)  Staff training. Initially, all utility staff shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected. Thereafter, all utility staff shall undergo update training not less than annually. Additionally, all new utility employees shall undergo training. 
(c)  Service provider arrangements. In the event the utility engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, including but not limited to franchise utility providers, the utility will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. 
(1)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and 
(2)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers review the utility's program and report any red flags to the program administrator. 
(d)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the Red Flag Rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the utility's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices are to be limited to the finance department and those employees who need to known them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

Sec. 90-2. - Requirements for park land dedication. 
    Neighborhood and community parks and recreational facilities are those facilities providing for a variety of recreational opportunities within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby. Park zones will be established by the parks and recreation department and shown on the official city limits map for the City of Pharr and shall be prima facie proof that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from any residence located therein. The ultimate residential property owners, who by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities. Therefore, the following requirements are adopted to effect the purposes stated. 
(Ord. No. O-99-49, § 1, 10-5-99) 
Sec. 90-3. - General requirements. 
(a)  Whenever a final plat is filed for approval with the city for the development of a residential area under zoning use district R-1, in accordance with the planning and zoning regulations of the city, such plat shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of an area of land to the city for park purposes, which area shall equal one acre for every 15 acres of proposed development. Any proposed plat submitted to the city for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this section. The required dedication of this subsection may be met by a payment of money, in lieu of land, when permitted or required by other provisions of this section. 
(b)  Whenever a final plat is filed for approval with the city for the development of a residential area under zoning use districts R-2 through R-4, in accordance with the planning and zoning regulations of the city, such plat shall be accompanied by a park development fee of $250.00 per dwelling unit. 
(c)  Whenever a building permit for new construction, remodeling or addition is applied for under zoning use districts R-3 and R-4, within the city limits, on property already platted, that creates additional residential dwelling units, such permit application shall be accompanied by a park development fee of $250.00 per dwelling unit. 
(d)  Whenever a final plat is filed for approval with the city for residential development, on property that lies outside the official city limits, but within the extra territorial jurisdiction, as defined by chapter 42 of the Local Government Code, such plat shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of an area of land to the city for park purposes, which area shall equal one acre for every 15 acres of residential development. Any proposed plat submitted to the city for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this section. The required dedication of this subsection may be met by a payment of money, in lieu of land, when permitted or required by other provisions of this section. 
(e)  The city commission declares that development of an area resulting in a land dedication smaller than five acres, for public parks purposes is impractical. Therefore, if fewer than 75 acres are proposed by a plat filed for approval, the developer shall be required to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land, amount provided by section 90-4, rather than to dedicate any land area. No plat showing a dedication of less than five acres shall be approved 
(f)  In instances where an area of less than ten acres, but more than five acres, is required to be dedicated, the city shall have the right to accept the dedication for approval on the final plat, or to refuse same, after consideration of the recommendation of the parks and recreation committee, and to require payment of cash, in lieu of land, in the amount provided by section 90-4, if the city determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain in the area of the proposed development, or if the recreation potential for that zone would be better served by expanding or improving existing parks. 
(g)  In instances where an area equal to or greater than five acres is required to be dedicated, the city shall accept the donation of land for the final plat, provided that such land is appropriate for development of park and recreation facilities, as recommended by the parks and recreation committee. If the city deems such land as unsuitable for development of parks or recreation facilities, then the developer shall be required to pay the applicable cash, in lieu of land, amount provided by section 90-4. 
(h)  The dedication required by this section shall be made by recording the final plat and contemporaneously, by separate instrument, unless additional dedication is required subsequent to the filing of the final plat. If the actual number of completed dwelling units exceed the figure upon which the original dedication was based, such additional dedication shall be required, and shall be made by payment of cash, in lieu of land, amount provided by section 90-4, or by the conveyance of an entire numbered lot or lots to the city. 
(i)  If a development fee is paid on a property outside the city limits, and such property is later annexed into the city, such fees as have already been paid shall be credited to the development at the rate of one lot equals one dwelling unit. 
(Ord. No. O-99-49, § 1, 10-5-99) 
Sec. 90-4. - Money in lieu of land. 
(a)  Subject to approval by the city commission, a land owner responsible for dedication under this section may elect to meet the requirements of section 90-3, in whole or in part, by a cash payment, in lieu of land, in the amount set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Such payment, in lieu of land, shall be made at or prior to the time of final plat recording for subdivisions. 
(b)  The dedication requirement shall be met by a payment, in lieu of land, at a per-acre price, set from time to time by resolution by the city commission, sufficient to acquire land and develop such for neighborhood and community parks and recreation facilities or make improvements to existing parks to serve the surrounding properties in which such development is located. Unless changed by the city commission, such per-acre price shall be computed on the basis of $1,250.00 per acre of development. Cash payments may be used only for acquisition or improvements of park and recreation facilities located within the same park fee zone as the development. 
(Ord. No. O-99-49, § 1, 10-5-99) 
Sec. 90-5. - Special fund; right to refund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a special fund for the deposit of all sums paid in lieu of land dedicated for park purposes, which fund shall be known as the Park Land Dedication Fund. All interest accruing to such account shall be deposited to same, and shall be used for the same purpose as the fund. 
(b)  The city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this section with reference to the individual building permits or plats involved. Any funds paid for such purposes must be expended by the city within ten years from the date received by the city for acquisition or development of a neighborhood park as defined herein. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis. If not so expended, the owners of the property on the last day of such period shall be entitled to a prorate refund of such sum, computed on a square footage of area basis. The owners of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right shall be forever barred.

The city has spent considerable funds in a continuing beautification program and is committed to an overall aesthetic improvement. The visual nuisance presented by an unregulated accumulation of signs within the city limits and its extraterritorial jurisdiction is not conducive to this effort

(a)  Payment of fees required. Until all applicable fees, charges and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any application or appeal under this chapter. 
(b)  Determination of fees. The city commission, after receiving the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission, shall determine and set forth a fee schedule for the purpose of recovering the administrative cost of processing zoning and subdivision requests and the public hearings called for by this chapter. Such fee shall be paid by the applicant and shall not be designed for restricting an applicant's ability to seek a hearing and/or to generate revenue for other than recovery of actual administrative costs incurred by the city. Immediately upon receipt of an application and fee, the director of planning shall note thereon the date of filing and make a permanent record thereof. 
(c)  Inspections, fee. An inspection fee of two percent of the estimated cost of improvements will be deposited with the city. The plans and specifications will be reviewed by the city engineer to ensure that the construction will conform to the city's standards. All construction shall be inspected while in progress by the city engineer and the city inspector. Upon completion, the work will be approved by the city engineer; and a statement signed by the city engineer stating that the construction conforms to specifications will be presented to the director of planning prior to recording the plat, or when security has been posted, prior to acceptance of the public improvement. 
(Code 1976, § 30-89) 
Sec. 118-13. - Variances. 
    The city commission shall have the ultimate power to grant or reject variances upon receipt of a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission may authorize a variance from this chapter when, in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. In granting a variance, the planning and zoning commission shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable in the public interest. In making the findings required by this section, the planning and zoning commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of the land involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, the number of persons who will reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of such variance upon traffic conditions and upon the public health, safety, convenience and welfare in the vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the planning and zoning commission finds that: 
(1)  There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land; 
(2)  The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; 
(3)  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or injurious to other property in the area; and 
(4)  The granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly subdivision of other land in the area in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
Such findings of the planning and zoning commission, together with the specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the planning and zoning commission meeting at which such variance is granted. Variances may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter, so that the public health, safety and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done. Pecuniary hardship to the subdivider, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship. 
(Code 1976, § 30-90) 
Sec. 118-14. - Appeals. 
    Any subdivider contesting any disapproval and/or the interpretation and/or application of any rule, standard, regulation, determination, requirement or necessity set forth in this chapter shall have the right, after filing a written request with the planning and zoning commission as set forth in this chapter, to have a hearing thereon before such body within 21 days after the date of the filing of such request. The decision of the planning and zoning commission shall be final, and further appeal therefrom shall be in accordance with appropriate law.

(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any person violating any provision of this chapter within the jurisdiction of the city shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined as provided in section 1-6. Each day that such violation continues shall be a separate offense. Prosecution or conviction under this section shall never be a bar to any other remedy or relief for violations of this chapter. 
(b)  Any person violating any provision of this chapter within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, but outside the corporate limits of the city, shall not be guilty of a misdemeanor within the meaning of subsection (a) in this section, nor shall be fined in relation thereto. However, the city may institute an action in the district court to enjoin the violation of any provision of this chapter in such extraterritorial jurisdiction, the district court having been empowered to grant any or all types of injunctive relief in such cases under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 212.003.

(j)  Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited except as short stubs to permit future expansion, and shall not exceed the depth of one lot on each side of such street, provided that in no case shall such depth exceed 250 feet. 
(k)  Culs-de-sac. A cul-de-sac shall not be more than 600 feet in length or provide access to more than 25 dwelling units unless approved by the planning and zoning commission for specific reasons of topography or engineering design. In residential areas, the turnaround shall have a minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet and a minimum driving surface radius of 40 feet. In commercial or industrial areas, the turnaround shall have a minimum right-of-way radius of 100 feet and a minimum driving surface radius of 90 feet. 
(l)  Marginal access streets. Where a subdivision has frontage on or borders an arterial street, the planning and zoning commission may require marginal access streets to be provided on both sides or on the subdivision side of the arterial street, unless the adjacent lots back up to, side up to, or front with extra depth and access off an alley, and provide some other means of restricting individual access directly to the arterial, or unless the planning and zoning commission determines such marginal access streets are not desirable under the facts of a particular case for adequate protection of the lots and separation of through and local traffic. 
(m)  Local or residential streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out as to discourage their use by through traffic.

(Code 1976, § 30-62) 
Sec. 118-48. - Water, sewer, drainage facilities, and fire hydrants. 
(a)  Generally. 
(1)  The subdivider shall dedicate, at his own cost, such rights-of-way and construct such water mains, water lines, fire hydrants, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and drainage ditches of such a size as to adequately serve the area being subdivided, as determined by the director of planning. All facilities shall be constructed in accordance with city standards. 
(2)  In all subdivision developments, dwelling units (single-family, duplexes, townhouses, multifamily, apartments, condominiums and cluster developments) shall be connected to sanitary sewer mains by approved sewer lines, except where septic tanks are approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
(3)  If the city should require the dedication of additional right-of-way or the construction of storm sewers, drainage ditches, sanitary sewers or water mains of a size greater than required for the subdivision alone, the city shall, within one year after date of approval of the final construction plans, provided construction has been completed within such one-year period and in accordance with approved construction plans, reimburse the subdivider for any increased cost of such facilities upon acceptance of such facilities by the city. 
(4)  The subdivider shall provide, prior to the beginning of any such subdivision improvements, a guarantee of performance in accordance with section 118-207. Upon the completion of the system and acceptance by the city, the installation shall become the property of the city to operate and maintain. 
(b)  Responsibility for installation. 
(1)  Contributions to construction of water lines. The subdivider's contribution to the cost of water service to the subdivision shall be an amount equal to the installed cost, including all labor, ditching, engineering and material, including pipes, fire hydrants, valves, fittings and other appurtenances necessary to furnish water service to the subdivision. The city has adopted water tapping fees, and these shall be paid according to such fee schedule prior to installation of water lines (see section 118-49). If any part of the water line is required to be larger than that necessary to serve the subdivision, in order to provide the service elsewhere in the city water system, the city shall pay for the pipe in excess of the size required of the developer, as soon as funds can be made available. For purposes of this section, water lines eight inches or less in diameter are considered to be necessary for any subdivision development; therefore, the city will not participate in the cost of providing lines equal to or less than eight inches in diameter. 
Where a developer is required to extend a water line to reach his subdivision, and such extension is 300 feet or longer, the developer may obtain reimbursement from other landowners who tie onto such line, if by resolution the city commission shall deem it just and fair that such reimbursement should be forthcoming. Such reimbursement shall apply only to the cost of constructing off-site lines and shall recognize that the subdivider may not recover his own share of such expenses from third parties. Further, this provision shall not apply to a looped line where the developer is required to loop water lines as a requirement for approval of a developer's subdivision. 
In addition to the amount of reimbursement to be charged to the party requesting to tie on to the water line, the city shall recover a fee of $25.00 from each such party requesting to tie on, such fee to cover the costs to the city of administering such reimbursement program. 
(2)  Contribution to construction of wastewater lines. The subdivider's contribution to the cost of wastewater service to the subdivision shall be equal to the installed cost, including all labor, ditching, engineering and material, including pipe, lift stations, manholes and appurtenances necessary to furnish wastewater service to the subdivision. The city has adopted wastewater tapping fees, and these shall be paid according to such fee schedule prior to installation of wastewater lines (see section 118-49). If any part of the wastewater line is required to be larger than that necessary to serve the subdivision, in order to provide the service necessary elsewhere in the city wastewater system, the city shall, provided funds are available, pay for the pipe in excess of the size required of the developer. For purposes of this section, wastewater lines of eight inches or less in diameter are considered to be necessary to serve any subdivision development; therefore, the city will not participate in the cost of providing lines equal to or less than eight inches in diameter. 
(3)  Installation of drainage system. The subdivider shall be responsible for providing an adequate drainage system, consisting of pipes, swales, natural features and manmade improvements that effectively carry runoff created by the development of the site. 
(4)  Bridges and/or large drainage structures. Provided that funds are available, the city may participate in the extra cost of bridges and/or large drainage structures on principal streets shown on the major thoroughfare plan. 
(c)  Extension of city facilities. To properly serve a subdivision, it may be necessary to extend existing city utilities and/or drainage facilities. When these extensions of facilities are constructed outside the proposed subdivision, they are referred to in this subsection as off-site improvements. The subdivider shall install at his own expense off-site improvements of such size to adequately serve the area being subdivided. However, the city may require the construction of off-site improvements of a size greater than set out in this subsection; and the city may within one year after the date of approval of the final construction plans, provided construction has been completed within such one-year period and in accordance with approved construction plans, shall, upon approval, reimburse the subdivider for any increased cost of such facilities. 
(d)  Bid tabulation sheet and construction contract requirements. Before any subdivider shall be entitled to reimbursement of any funds under this section, he shall furnish the city with a signed copy of the bid tabulation sheet which has been accepted by him for construction of the improvements for which the reimbursement is to be made, as well as a copy of the construction contract between such subdivider and the contractor. 
(Code 1976, § 30-63)

(d)  Water and sewer systems required. All subdivisions within the city or its extraterritorial jurisdiction must provide for an approved water and sewer system unless granted a variance by the city commission. 
(e)  Payment in phases. Subdivisions approved by the city commission for development in various stages may pay the tapping charges on each phase as it is being developed. 
(f)  Private utilities. Subdivisions developed in phases with private utilities will be responsible for paying a fee for their total acreage being serviced by the city utilities. The tapping fees may be paid for the phase individually as it is being developed. The only exception will be private utility lines hooked up to a privately owned water or sewer system approved by the city commission.

    Prior to the official filing of a preliminary plat, the subdivider, his planner, engineer or representative, should consult with and present one copy of a proposed plan (preapplication layout), including proposed water, sewer, paving and drainage, of the subdivision to the director of planning for comments and advice on the procedures, specifications and standards required by the city for the subdivision of land. 
(Code 1976, § 30-19) 
Sec. 118-153. - Vacation instrument and/or replatting. 
(a)  Authority. All subdivision plats, plans and replats are to be approved by the planning and zoning commission in accordance with the requirements of Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 974a, as amended. 
(b)  Procedure. 
(1)  Vacation of previous plat. 
a.  Prior to the sale of any lot. In cases where lots have not been sold, any plan, plat or replat may be vacated by the proprietors of the land covered thereby at any time before the sale of any lot therein by a written instrument declaring such plan, plat or replat to be vacated, duly executed, acknowledged and recorded in the same office as the plat to be vacated, provided the approval of the planning and zoning commission shall have been obtained; and the execution and recordation of the instrument shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the plan, plat or replat as vacated. 
b.  After the sale of any lot. In cases where lots have been sold, the plan, plat or replat, or any part thereof, may be vacated upon the application of all the owners of lots in such plat and with the approval of the planning and zoning commission. 
(2)  Amending plat without vacation of immediate previous plat. If items (1) through (8) of subsection (b) of this section do not apply, a replat or resubdivision of a plat, or a portion thereof, but without vacation of the immediate previous plat, is expressly authorized to be recorded and shall be deemed valid and controlling when approved by the planning and zoning commission under the following conditions: 
a.  All proposals to amend plat: 
1.  The replat or resubdivision of a plat, or a portion thereof, has been signed and acknowledged by the owners of the particular property which is being resubdivided or replatted; 
2.  The replat or resubdivision of a plat, or a portion thereof, has been approved by the planning and zoning commission after a public hearing in relation thereto at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard; 
3.  The replat or resubdivision of a plat, or a portion thereof, does not attempt to alter, amend or remove any covenants or restrictions; and 
4.  There is compliance, when applicable, with subsections (b)(2)b.2 and (b)(2)b.3 of this section. 
b.  Corrections due to error or change. The planning and zoning commission is authorized to approve and issue an amending plat which is signed by the applicants only and which is for one or more of the purposes set forth in this subsection. Approval and issuance of such an amending plat shall not require notice, hearing or approval of other lot owners, only if the sole purpose of the amending plat is to: 
1.  Correct an error in any course or distance shown on the prior plat; 
2.  Add any course or distance that was omitted on the prior plat; 
3.  Correct an error in the description of the real property shown on the prior plat; 
4.  Indicate monuments set after death, disability or retirement from practice of the engineer or surveyor charged with responsibilities for setting monuments; 
5.  Show the proper location or character of any monument which has been changed in location or character or which originally was shown at the wrong location or incorrectly as to its character on the prior plat; 
6.  Correct any other type of scrivener's or clerical error or omission as previously approved by the planning and zoning commission or governing body of the city; such errors and omissions may include but are not limited to lot numbers, acreage, street names and identification of adjacent recorded plats; 
7.  Correct an error in courses and distances of lot lines between two adjacent lots where both lot owners join in the application for plat amendment and neither lot is abolished, provided that such amendment does not attempt to remove recorded covenants or restrictions and does not have a material adverse effect on the property rights of the other owners in the plat; or 
8.  Relocate a lot line in order to cure an inadvertent encroachment of a building or improvement on a lot line or on an assessment. 
c.  Residential areas of less than two units per lot: 
1.  If any of the proposed area to be resubdivided or replatted was limited within the immediate preceding five years by any interim or permanent zoning classification to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot, or if any lot in the immediate previous subdivision was limited by deed restriction to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot, the following additional requirements for approval shall apply: 
i.  A notice of the planning and zoning commission public hearing shall be published in an official paper or a paper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days in advance of the public hearing. 
ii.  Written notice of the public hearing, which includes a copy of subsection (b)(2)c.2 of this section, shall be forwarded not less than 15 days prior to the date of the hearing to owners of all lots in the immediate preceding subdivision plat. Such owners shall be determined in accordance with the last approved ad valorem tax roll. 
iii.  Such notice may be served by depositing such notice, properly addressed and postage paid, in a post office or posted depository within the boundaries of the city. 
iv.  If the immediate preceding subdivision plat contains more than 100 lots, notice of the public hearing shall be mailed not less than 15 days prior to the date of the hearing only to those owners of lots in the subdivision which are located within 500 feet of the lots that are sought to be replatted or resubdivided. 
2.  The city planning and zoning commission or other appropriate governing body shall require, in any subdivision or replatting to which this subsection applies, written approval of 66 2/3 percent of: 
i.  Owners of all lots in such plat; or 
ii.  Owners of all lots in such plat within 500 feet of the property sought to be replatted or resubdivided if such immediate preceding plat contains more than 100 lots. 
The provisions of this subsection shall apply, however, only if 20 percent or more of the owners to whom notice is required to be given of the lots in such plat, a portion of which is sought to be replatted or resubdivided, file with the city planning and zoning commission or other appropriate governing body written protest of such replatting or resubdivision prior to or at the hearing referred to in the notice of the proposed replatting or resubdivision. 
Note: In computing percentages of ownership, each lot in such subdivision shall be considered equal to all other lots regardless of size or number of owners, and the owners of each lot shall be entitled to cast only one vote per lot.

(5)  The utilities, as required in this chapter, are in place to serve each parcel or lot of such subdivision or resubdivision, or the installation of utilities will be a minor job, the necessary easements are already existing and arrangements to provide such utilities have been made. If a wastewater collection system is not available, all lots must have been approved for septic tank installation by the county health department. 
(6)  The uses proposed for the property will not require rezoning of any portion of the property, and the resulting lots conform to all area and setback requirements of this chapter and the adopted zoning ordinance. 
(b)  Formal application. For a short form subdivision or resubdivision approval, formal application shall be made by the subdivider in writing to the director of planning. In addition to any other information contained in such application, the application must indicate the following: 
(1)  How many acres in the acreage to be subdivided are within the boundaries of Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2. 
(2)  Of the acres within the boundaries of Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2, how many acres will require raw water from Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2 for manmade lakes and/or for irrigation uses; and how many acres will not require such raw water. 
(3)  That the subdivision will or will not require municipal water service. 
(c)  Filing. The subdivider shall file 12 blue or black line copies of the plat, one linen and one reproducible mylar, with the director of planning at least 15 days prior to the date at which the planning and zoning commission will consider the request.

(5)  The planning and zoning commission shall have 30 days to conditionally approve or disapprove the plat after it is formally filed with the staff and the fees are paid. If the plat is disapproved, the planning and zoning commission shall inform the subdivider, in writing, of the reasons at the time such action is taken. Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2 may review the copy of the plat forwarded to it and return such copy to the director of planning. If such plat is returned prior to the planning and zoning commission meeting immediately prior to 30 days from the filing date with stated requirements noted, the director of planning shall notify the planning and zoning commission of such requirements. The planning and zoning commission will then disapprove such plat subject to subdivider satisfying the requirements noted by the Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2. If amendment to the plat is required by the Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2, a copy of the amended plat shall be transmitted to the Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2 for its approval. 
(6)  If the subdivision is subject to the requirement to obtain a waiver of irrigation service and consent to exclusion form, such subdivision shall not be approved and shall be conditionally disapproved if at the planning and zoning commission meeting immediately prior to the expiration of the 30 days after the filing of the application the waiver of irrigation service and consent to exclusion has not been received by the city from the Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2. 
(7)  If the plat is not disapproved within 30 days from the filing date, it shall be deemed to have been approved by the planning and zoning commission. A certificate showing the filing dates provided for under this section and the failure to take action thereon within the periods prescribed in this section shall be issued by the planning and zoning commission on demand. This certificate shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence of approval required in this section. 
(8)  If the plat or replat is approved, the current tax certificate submitted, and all requirements of section 118-12 have been met, the city commission through the director of planning shall cause to have the plat recorded with the county clerk. No plat shall be filed for record without the written consent of the subdivider. If the subdivider fails to give such written consent within 30 days of the date of final approval of the plat, the city commission may at any time thereafter cancel such approval. If the plat is filed for record with the county clerk, the Hidalgo County Irrigation District No. 2 shall be notified of the volume and page number at which the plat is recorded. 
(9)  A subdivider may present to the planning and zoning commission a proposal sketch or outline of what he proposes to do without first platting the property. The planning and zoning commission may approve the proposed plan with the mandatory condition that the subdivider then submit a plat to the planning and zoning commission in accordance with all requirements of section 118-153. This procedure does not constitute preliminary plat or final plat approval. 
(Code 1976, § 30-21) 
Sec. 118-155. - Subdivision master plan. 
(a)  Where the proposed subdivision constitutes a unit of a larger tract which is to be subsequently subdivided, the subdivider shall be required to submit a subdivision master plan, prepared by a surveyor and/or engineer, of the entire area. 
(b)  The subdivision master plan shall be drawn at a scale of not less than one inch to 500 feet on a topographic map. The master subdivision plan shall include all land under control of or owned by the developer, and contain or have attached thereto:

(c)  The overall layout, if approved by the planning and zoning commission, shall be attached to and filed with a copy of the approved subdivision plat in the permanent files of the director of planning. Thereafter, plats of subsequent units of such subdivision shall conform to such approved overall layout unless changed by the planning and zoning commission. However, the planning and zoning commission shall not change such approved overall layout unless the subdivider agrees to such change or the planning and zoning commission finds that: 
(1)  Adherence to the previously approved overall layout will hinder the orderly subdivision of land in the area in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; or 
(2)  Changes to the previously approved overall layout will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare. 
(d)  Approval of a subdivision master plan shall be effective for two years, unless reviewed by the planning and zoning commission in the light of new or significant information which would necessitate a revision of the subdivision master plan. Approval may be extended for one-year periods by consent of the planning and zoning commission. The subdivider shall still be required to submit a preliminary and a final plat, including construction plans, for each unit of development. Approval of a subdivision master plan shall not constitute automatic approval of the preliminary or final plat.

If the planning and zoning commission should deem changes in a preliminary plat as necessary, it shall so inform the subdivider in writing. 
(k)  If no development has occurred which would affect the proposed plat after six months of effective approval, the planning and zoning commission may, upon the application of the subdivider, extend approval of such plat for an additional six months. At the end of this six-month extension, the preliminary plat approval shall be revoked, in writing, by the city to the subdivider.

Sec. 118-231. - Applicability of article. 
    The regulations set forth in this article or as set forth elsewhere in this chapter when referred to in this article are regulations in the planned unit development (PUD) subdivision. 
(Code 1976, § 30-45(a)) 
Sec. 118-232. - Purposes of the PUD. 
    In certain instances the purposes of this chapter may be achieved by the development of planned units which do not conform in all respects with the land use pattern designated on the zoning map, the district regulations prescribed by the zoning ordinance, or the subdivision requirements of this chapter. A planned unit development (PUD) may include a combination of different dwelling types and/or a variety of land uses which creatively complement each other and harmonize with existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity. In order to encourage creative development of the land, provide locations for well-planned comprehensive developments, and provide for variety in the development pattern of the city which conforms with the purposes of the master plan, the planning and zoning commission is empowered to approve subdivision for planned unit developments. Technical planning review of these planned unit developments should be provided by the director of planning. 
(Code 1976, § 30-45(b)) 
Sec. 118-233. - Subdivision requirements of a planned unit development. 
(a)  It is the intent of this chapter that subdivision review under the subdivision regulation be carried out simultaneously with the review of a planned unit development plan under the zoning ordinance. 
(b)  The final development plans required in the zoning ordinance must be submitted in a form which will satisfy the requirements of this chapter for the preliminary and final plats, as set out in article III of this chapter. 
(c)  The final plat and construction plans must be in conformance with the approved planned unit development plan before they may be approved by the planning and zoning commission. Approval and recording of the final plat and construction of an approved subdivision shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  The planning and zoning commission may vary the specific requirements of this chapter if, on the basis of the development plan and the evidence submitted, the planning and zoning commission makes the following findings: 
(1)  That the proposed modifications to the requirements of this chapter by the planned unit development are in accord with the objectives of the comprehensive general plan and the zoning and subdivision ordinances and the major purposes of the district in which the site is located. 
(2)  That the proposed modification provides for better project design. 
(3)  That the standards of population density, site area and dimensions, site coverage, yard spaces, heights of structures, distances between structures, usable open space, and off-street parking and off-street loading facilities will be such that the development will not generate more traffic than the streets in the vicinity can carry without congestion and will not overload the utilities. 
(4)  That the development is planned with adequate provisions for light, air, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and recreational facilities equal to or better than the requirements of this chapter. 
(5)  That the combination of different dwelling types and/or the variety of land uses in the development will complement each other and will harmonize with existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity. 
(6)  Financial reasons shall not be the sole reason for modification of standards. 
(e)  Both this chapter and the zoning ordinance contain regulations which apply to such matters in the design of a planned unit development as streets, utilities and open spaces. In any planned development for which the provisions of the two are in conflict, the advice and written recommendations from the city engineer, director of planning and/or public works director shall be given to the planning and zoning commission and the city commission to determine which standard shall prevail.

Sec. 134-31. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of the administration and enforcement of this article and unless otherwise stated in this article, the following words shall have the meaning as indicated in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. 
    Accessway means a paved area intended to provide ingress and egress of vehicular traffic from a public right-of-way to an off-street parking area or loading area. 
    Buffer means a visual screen constructed of wood, concrete block, masonry, or landscape material in such a manner that adjacent property will be screened from the use contemplated, so that noise, solid waste, or other objectional influences will be avoided. Such buffer shall be horizontal to the ground, a minimum of six feet in height, and 100 percent opaque, except where extraordinary circumstances exist, or where additional height is required by state law or will more adequately accomplish the desired end. 
    Contiguous means adjacent property whose property lines are shared, or are separated by a street, alley, easement or right-of-way. 
    Frontage means lineal distance measured along all abutting street right-of-way. 
    Ground cover means low growing plants planted in such a manner as to form a continuous cover over the ground, such as liriope, low growing varieties of honeysuckle, confederate jasmine, English ivy or others. 
    Landscape development means trees, shrubs, ground cover, vines or grass installed in planting areas for the purpose of fulfilling the requirements of this article. 
    Paved ground surface area (also referred to as paved area or paved ground area) means any paved ground surface area, excepting public right-of-way, used for the purpose of driving, parking, storing or displaying of vehicles, boats, trailers and mobile homes, including new and used car lots and other open lot uses. Parking structures, covered drive-in parking areas to the dripline of the covering or garages shall not be considered as paved ground surface areas. 
    Planting area means any area designed for landscape planting having a minimum of ten square feet of actual plantable area and an inside dimension on any side of at least 18 inches. 
    Reconstruction means the rehabilitation or replacement of a structure on property which either has been damaged, altered or removed or shall be altered to an extent exceeding 75 percent of the assessed valuation of such structure or 75 percent of the combined assessed valuation of such structure and land as shown on the most recent tax rolls of the city. 
    Shrub means any self-supporting woody evergreen and/or flowering species. 
    Street line means that line limiting the right-of-way of the street and being identical with the property line of persons owning property fronting on the streets.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 134-32. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide the orderly, safe and healthful development of the community and to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the city. 
(Ord. No. O-91-43, § II, 10-1-91) 
Sec. 134-33. - Findings and objectives. 
(a)  The objective of this article is to establish requirements for the installation and maintenance of landscape elements and other means of site improvement in off-street parking areas and other developed properties. The justification for such regulation is threefold: 
(1)  To aid in regulating and controlling vehicular and pedestrian circulation in parking areas; 
(2)  To enhance the community's ecological or environmental and aesthetic qualities; and 
(3)  To protect and conserve the value of property. 
(b)  The present process of development has a negative effect on the ecological balance of an area. Paved surfaces, automobiles, buildings and other improvements all produce great increases in air temperatures, a problem especially noticeable in this southern region, whereas plants have the opposite effect through transpiration and the creation of shade. Likewise, impervious surfaces created by development generate greater water runoff causing problems from erosion and flooding. This is a particular relevant concern in this city and the surrounding area due to the lack of gradient and drainage access to the ocean and the consequent need to prevent upsetting the hydrological balance that has evolved. 
(c)  The increased number, size and complexity of off-street parking areas serving ever larger commercial, industrial and other facilities indicates a need for proper traffic control, and vehicular and pedestrian movement or circulation in order to avoid a potential danger to the people's health, safety and welfare. 
(d)  The importance of preserving and improving the natural environment and maintaining a working ecological balance is of increasing concern. The fact that the use of landscape elements can effectively aid in the air purification, oxygen regeneration, water absorption, and noise, glare and heat abatement as well as the preservation of the community's aesthetic qualities indicates that the use of landscape elements is of benefit to the health, welfare and general well-being of the community and therefore it is proper that the use of such element be required. 
(Ord. No. O-91-43, § III, 10-1-91) 
Sec. 134-34. - Plans for buffers. 
    Prior to construction of buffers, as defined in section 134-31, complete plans showing type of material, depth of berm, and structural support shall be submitted to the building permit office for analysis to determine whether or not: 
(1)  The screen will withstand the pressures of time and nature; 
(2)  The screen adequately accomplishes the purpose for which it was intended. 
(Ord. No. O-91-43, § IV(A)(2), 10-1-91) 
Sec. 134-35. - Required landscape installation. 
(a)  Objectives. In addition to those objectives stated in section 134-33, the purpose of this section is to ensure the placement of landscape elements within off-street paved surface areas so as to: 
(1)  Channel vehicular and pedestrian movement within off-street paved ground surface areas into safer and more logical patterns; 
(2)  Ensure that the off-street paved ground area and the adjacent right-of-way are clearly and visually delineated; 
(3)  Ensure that physical access between each is effectively limited to established points of ingress and egress; 
(4)  Ensure that those established and acceptable ingress and egress points are clearly delineated; 
(5)  Ensure that noise, glare and other distractions of movement within one area do not adversely affect activity within adjacent properties; and 
(6)  Regenerate oxygen and reduce heat, glare, water runoff and other conditions concomitant with the construction of expanses of buildings or pavement within the parcel. 
(b)  Requirements. The amount of landscaping required for street yards per zone shall be as follows: 
(1)  Two-family residential, 15 percent of street yard. 
(2)  Medium density multifamily (R-3), 15 percent of street yard. 
(3)  High-density multifamily (R-4), 15 percent of street yard. 
(4)  Office-professional (OP), 15 percent of street yard. 
(5)  Neighborhood commercial (NC), 15 percent of street yard. 
(6)  General business (C), 15 percent of street yard. 
(7)  Central business district (C-2), zero percent. 
(8)  Heavy commercial (HC), 15 percent of street yard. 
(9)  Limited industrial (LI), 15 percent of street yard. 
(10)  Heavy industrial (HI), 15 percent of street yard. 
(c)  Credit for trees. Whereas trees contribute greatly to the quality of the community's environment through carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen generation, air purification by precipitation of dust particles, transpiration, reduction of heat by transpiration and the creation of shade, and to the improvement of the community's aesthetic qualities; and whereas the extent of the above positive contributions are a function of the size of the tree rather than of the size of the planting area in which the tree is planted; therefore, in recognition of the contributions made by trees to the objectives of this article, credit shall be given for each tree in accordance with the following schedule: 
(1)  Trees which are newly planted shall receive credit against the landscape area requirements according to the following schedule: 
a.  Large trees: 
1.  Greater than 12-inch caliber, 200 square feet. 
2.  Greater than six-inch caliber, 100 square feet. 
b.  Medium trees, between three-inch to six-inch caliber, 50 square feet. 
The term "caliber" means the average diameter of the trees measured four feet above ground level. 
(2)  In order to encourage the preservation of trees that are already established and growing, an additional credit of 100 square feet shall be given to existing trees that are preserved rather than cut. 
(3)  The credits permitted under this subsection (c) shall apply where the tree is in a planting area as required by this article and whose least dimension is one-half the radius of the crown spread of the tree measured from the trunk center. In no case shall this least dimension be less than a radius of 21/2 feet, measured from the center of the tree trunk to the near edge of the landscape area. The ground surface within such preserved planting areas shall be maintained in a porous or vegetative cover. Credit allowed for trees shall be in addition to the actual square footage of planting area within which the tree is located. 
(d)  Location of landscaped area. Landscaped area as required in subsection (b) of this section must be provided along the street yard of each lot. Corner lots and other lots abutting two or more streets must landscape the street yard for each street. See illustrations attached to Ordinance No. O-91-43, designated as attachment 1 thereto, illustration nos. 1 through 10; the illustrations are intended to show, in pictorial form, the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. O-91-43, § V, 10-1-91) 
Sec. 134-36. - Applicability to new and existing developed areas. 
(a)  New development or redevelopment. 
(1)  The requirements and standards for the installation and maintenance of landscape elements and site improvements as set forth in this article shall apply to all developed areas within the city. 
(2)  If the zoning ordinance of the city would otherwise permit in excess of 85 percent total land coverage by building development, the provisions of this article shall supersede and prevail over such other requirements. In no event, except as expressly permitted in this article, shall more than 85 percent of a lot or area be covered by building development. 
(3)  If a principal use and some or all of the parking area, required or otherwise, serving the principal use is located on separate parcels, each parcel shall be landscaped according to the zone requirements for the principal use, with the exception of the central business (C-2) zoning district, in which case a separate parking area will be landscaped at least five percent of the lot area. 
(b)  Existing development areas; nonconformance; when compliance required. 
(1)  All property with existing development on the effective date of this article which is not in compliance with the provisions of this article shall be considered nonconforming, and allowed to continue until such time as a building permit is granted to enlarge, extend, construct, reconstruct or structurally alter a structure or parking area on the property. At such time the provisions of this article shall apply to the previous existing paved areas as well as any new paved areas, and they shall be brought into compliance. 
A plan showing existing and new development, and the proposed landscaping, shall be submitted in accordance with section 134-38. 
(2)  No structure existing on the effective date of this article shall be required to be altered or moved in order to comply with the provisions of this article, except in the event of reconstruction. 
(Ord. No. O-91-43, § VI, 10-1-91) 
Sec. 134-37. - General requirements. 
(a)  Installation. All landscape materials shall be installed in the street yard of a lot and shall be installed in a sound workmanshiplike manner and according to accepted good planting procedures. 
(b)  Maintenance. The owner of the building, or his manager or agent, shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscape areas, which shall be maintained so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance at all times and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. All planted areas shall be provided with a readily available water supply and watered regularly to ensure continuous healthy growth and development. Maintenance shall include the replacement of all dead plant material promptly. If it is found that maintenance has not been maintained for a landscaped area the enforcing official shall take the necessary procedures as outlined under section 134-40(c). 
(c)  Planting criteria. 
(1)  Trees. Trees planted for credit under section 134-35(c) should be a minimum of six feet in height when measured immediately after planting. In the case of palms, the required measurement should be six feet from ground level to base of palm fronds. Trees should be species having an average mature spread of crown of greater than 15 feet in the lower Rio Grande Valley (excepting palms), having trunks which can be maintained in a clean condition for over six feet of clear wood measured from the ground. Trees having an average mature spread of crown less than 15 feet may be substituted by grouping such trees so as to create the equivalent of a 15-foot crown spread. Trees of species whose roots are likely to cause damage to public roadways or other public works should not be planted closer than 12 feet to such public works. 
(2)  Shrubs. Shrubs should be a minimum of one foot in height when measured immediately after planting. 
(3)  Vines. Vines should be a minimum of 30 inches in height one year after planting and may be used in conjunction with fences, screens or walls to meet buffer requirements and specifications. 
(4)  Ground cover. Ground covers other than grass should be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and reasonably complete coverage within one year after planting. 
(5)  Lawn grass. Grass areas should be planted in species normally grown as permanent lawn in the city. Grass areas may be sodded, plugged, sprigged or seeded, except that solid sod shall be used in swales or other areas subject to erosion. 
(6)  Synthetic lawns or plants. Synthetic or artificial lawns or plants shall not be used in lieu of plant requirements in this section. 
(7)  Architectural planters. The use of architectural planters may be permitted in fulfillment of landscape requirements. 
(Ord. No. O-91-43, § VII, 10-1-91) 
Sec. 134-38. - Determination, review and plan approval. 
(a)  Appropriate plans showing proposed landscape development, including figures to show compliance with this article, shall be submitted to the city. A plot plan drawn to scale, normally of not less than one inch equals 30 feet, shall include dimensions and distances, and shall clearly delineate any existing and proposed landscape development. Such plot plan shall also include detailed drawings of the entire off-street parking area and the location of proposed buildings. 
(b)  The following provisions and procedures shall apply to the determination, review, and approval of the requirements of this article. 
(1)  Determination of street yard. For purposes of applying any provision or requirement of this Code relating to street yards, the street yard shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions: 
a.  The "front wall building line" of the street yard shall be determined by drawing a line along the front building wall of each building on the lot facing or fronting the street right-of-way line; and where there is more than one building on the lot, by extending the line in a straight line between the outermost corners of each front building wall line of each building; and then extending the line from the outermost corners of the front building wall line of each building or buildings nearest the side lot lines, parallel to the street right-of-way line, to the side lot lines of the property. 
b.  The front wall building line shall not include porches and steps, and those portions of any sign, roof, window and other projections from the front building wall which extend beyond the building wall, as located at ground level. 
c.  The street right-of-way line to be used in determining the street yard shall be the right-of-way line along all public streets that are not alleys. Where any property is approved with a private street, the street yard of each lot fronting thereon shall be determined by using the curbline of the private street as the right-of-way line. 
d.  The street yard shall apply to each separately platted lot, or each portion of each lot which is leased for a business contained in a separate building. 
e.  Where property is developed with more than one building, such that one or more smaller isolated buildings are placed between the street right-of-way line and one or more other larger buildings located on the property, the street yard shall be determined by the front wall building line drawn along the front wall of the building or buildings which have the most linear feet of front wall facing the street right-of-way line. 
f.  Where a property is used solely as a commercial or private parking lot, the street yard shall include the whole property. 
g.  Where any property on one lot is to be developed in phases, so that only a portion of the determined street yard is to be used, such as parking lots for the current phase, the department may define or limit the street yard to the area being currently developed or used. 
h.  In calculating the area contained within the street yard for purposes of determining the tree and landscaping requirements of this article, the area occupied by buildings shall not be counted as the area within the street yard. 
(2)  Common or phased development. When any property is developed in phases, or is a common or unified development including more than one platted lot, the department may apply the requirements of this article to each phase of the development, or to all the lots being developed in common as though they were one lot, or otherwise apply the requirements as is reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this article. 
(3)  Landscape site plan required. The owner of any property to which this article applies shall submit a landscaping site plan to the department, in the form and manner specified by the department, prior to the issuance of a building permit for any building on the property, or prior to the issuance of a parking lot/driveway permit for any parking lot to which this article applies. The plan shall contain sufficient detail, as specified by the department, to show the following: 
a.  The location of all existing or proposed buildings which define the street yard, and the square footage included within the defined street yard. 
b.  How the tree requirements for the street yard are to be met, including the number, size, and location of all protected trees which are located within the street yard, those which are to be removed, and those which will remain. 
c.  How the requirements of landscaping of 15 percent of the street yard are to be met, including the location and size of all areas in the street yard that are to be permanently landscaped. 
d.  When the internal landscaping requirements for parking lots apply or the requirement of perimeter screening of parking lots applies, the size and location of the parking lot, the number of parking spaces, and how the requirements for screening are to be met. 
e.  When the property is required to provide screening for abutting residential uses, how the requirements are to be met. 
f.  Such other information, as specified by the department, as may be reasonably necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this article. 
(c)  The landscape site plan must be approved prior to issuance of a building permit. 
(d)  Single-family and two-family residential properties are exempt from the requirements of furnishing a landscape site plan as required of other properties under this section. 
(Ord. No. O-91-43, § VIII, 10-1-91) 
Sec. 134-39. - Exceptions. 
    The board of adjustments shall have the power to grant a variance in special cases where there are unusual and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships created in meeting the requirements of this article. The guidelines to be used in determining whether an exception should be granted are as follows: 
(1)  That meeting the requirements of this article would prohibit an owner of property from using land for a use that the zoning ordinance expressly permits. 
(2)  That the hardships or difficulties of meeting the requirements of this article are peculiar to that property, and not general in character. 
(3)  That the lack of landscaping will not be detrimental to adjoining property or to the health, safety and welfare of the general public. 
(4)  That the hardships and difficulties of the landscaping are greater than the benefits derived by the general public. 
Financial hardship due to meeting the requirements of this article is not sufficient to show unnecessary hardship, unless the financial difficulties amount to confiscation of property.

Chapter 139 - ACQUISITION, DISPOSITION AND/OR USE OF CITY PROPERTY 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 139-1. - Purpose and intent. 
    In order to remain consistent with the city's continuing efforts to establish timely, efficient and effective policies and procedures for the delivery of services to our customers, the city commission finds that the creation of a new chapter of the City Code of Ordinances is necessary to consolidate various policies and procedures regarding the acquisition, disposition and/or use of city property. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-50, § 1, 10-6-15) 
Sec. 139-2. - Definitions. 
    Words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the meanings set forth in this section, unless the context of their usage clearly requires otherwise. Words and phrases which are not defined in this chapter but are defined in other ordinances of the city shall be given the meanings set forth in those ordinances. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense shall include the future tense (and vice versa); words in the plural number shall include the singular number (and vice versa); and words in the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender (and vice versa). Headings and captions are for reference purposes only. Other words and phrases shall be given their common, ordinary meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 
(1)  City means the City of Pharr. 
(2)  Director means the director of the department responsible for the applicable duty. 
(3)  Easement means an interest in land granted to the city, to the public generally, and/or to a private utility corporation. 
(4)  Encroachment means any intrusion from abutting property of other use of city property, whether the property is owned in fee or by easement. 
(5)  Petition means a written request by a petitioner for rights or privileges under this chapter. The petition may be in letter form and must state the location of the affected city property and the purpose and cope of the proposed use of disposition of the property. The petition must further include such attachments and additional detail as the director may require. 
(6)  Petitioner means a person requesting a right or privilege governed by this chapter. More than one person may combine as one petitioner, but in such case each is jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the petitioner. 
(7)  Public right-of-way means a strip of land used or intended to be used, wholly or in part, as a public street, alley, crosswalk, sidewalk, or drainage way. 
(8)  Real property, as used in this chapter, includes any estate in land, easement, right-of-way, lease, permit, license, franchise, future interest, building, fixture, or any other right, title or interest in land or a building. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-50, § 1, 10-6-15) 
Sec. 139-3. - General provisions. 
(a)  No one may use public right-of-way or other property in which the city has an interest, whether in fee or easement, in a way governed by this chapter without acquiring rights under the relevant section. Nothing in this chapter requires a permit, license, or other document for approved utilities to place their facilities in streets or alleys as otherwise permitted by law. 
(b)  The director may require recording of instruments granting rights under this chapter in the official public records of real property of the county in which the land is situated. Petitioner must pay the recording cost. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided, the director may approve a permit or right of entry under this chapter without city commission action, if the permitted use conforms to the requirements of this chapter. 
(d)  Except as expressly stated, this chapter delegates no authority to approve, without action from the city commission, leases and license agreements, including renewals or continuations of rights previously granted. But nothing in this chapter impairs a delegation of authority outside this chapter. 
(e)  Any city officer to whom authority is delegated under this chapter may further delegate that authority to subordinates. Authority to bind the city to a contract may not be delegated below the level of director, unless the delegation is made personally by the city manager or a deputy or assistant city manager. All delegations must be in writing. Despite the foregoing, the city official to whom authority is delegated to for real estate may sign and bind the city to all contracts, deeds, and other documents and instruments part of real estate transactions approved by the city commission. 
(f)  Permits have indefinite duration but may be terminated by action from the city commission. Licenses have stated durations and are terminable according to their terms. Neither permits nor licenses under this chapter create property rights and no permittee or licensee is entitled to compensation for revocation of a permit or license. 
(g)  Permits will require the following information: 
(1)  The city's identity as the issuing authority. 
(2)  The identity and address of the permittee. 
(3)  Legal description of the affected city property. 
(4)  The scope of the activity permitted. 
(5)  The permit's indefinite duration (subject to revocation by city commission). 
(6)  Any special conditions imposed under this chapter. Permits should be signed on behalf of both the city and the petitioner and be in recordable form. Permits should be recorded in the real property records of the county in which the affected city property is located, but failure to record does not destroy the effectiveness of the permit. 
(h)  All construction, excavation, and placement of utilities or other facilities in public rights-of-way are subject to regulation. 
(i)  When fair market value must be determined under this chapter, the following procedures apply: 
(1)  A director may require that an independent professional appraisal be obtained. In such case, petitioner and the city will jointly select the appraiser, if they can agree. If they cannot promptly agree, city selects the appraiser. In either case, petitioner pays for the appraisal. Except as otherwise stated in a particular section, independent professional appraisals are of the fee simple interest in the affected land, according to its highest and best use. 
(2)  Alternatively, and at the director's discretion, a director may rely on an average of the per-square-foot Hidalgo County Appraisal District assessed values in the vicinity. If the property being appraised does not have structures, the director should consider only land values, not improvement values. 
(3)  In choosing between requiring a formal appraisal or relying on Hidalgo County Appraisal-assessed values, a director should balance whether the probable cost of a formal appraisal is disproportionate to the probable value of the affected property. Streets and alleys must be appraised not as rights-of-way but as if marketable fee-simple title to the affected property were in private hands and the city were condemning it for public-street right-of-way. Appraisals of other strips or oddly configured parcels must not be discounted because of the parcels' configuration. 
(j)  Those receiving rights under this chapter must maintain in good repair and condition any structure, covering, or appurtenance and the accompanying structural members extending over, under, or on public rights-of-way, drainage, or utility easement, or other city property. No such encroachment may be a nuisance or safety hazard. All such encroachments, when built, rebuilt or renovated, must conform to the latest edition of the International Building Code and other applicable building discipline codes. 
(k)  Grants of rights under this chapter do not relieve petitioner of any other approvals, permits, or licenses that may otherwise be required. No permit or license should be granted under this chapter if the proposed use would impair the primary public purpose of the affected public right-of-way or other city property. 
(l)  Property owners may install and maintain mail boxes conforming to U.S. Postal Service regulations without a permit or license under this chapter. 
(m)  Before granting or recommending granting rights under this chapter, the director may canvass some or all interested city departments. Utility agencies, and registered neighborhood associations in the vicinity. Based on comments received, the director may impose or recommend imposing special terms as a condition of approval. 
(n)  Responsibilities allocated to a city department in this chapter automatically succeed to any other department into which the designated department or the relevant function of that department is reorganized. 
(o)  Nothing in this chapter impairs an otherwise applicable requirement to seek planning commission approval of a proposed transaction. 
(p)  All fees under this chapter are waived for governmental petitioners other than utility agencies. This waiver does not include requirements to pay out of pocket costs or to pay fair market value for property interests. 
(q)  Except as may be specifically provided as to a particular fee, all processing and other fees and charges provided for in this chapter are non-refundable. 
(r)  No petitioner seeking rights under this chapter may acquire such rights before paying in full for all previously obtained rights of the type governed by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-50, § 1, 10-6-15) 
Sec. 139-4. - Permits for encroachments onto public streets or alleys. 
(a)  Petitions for permits for encroaching on public streets or alleys from owners of abutting property or from property-owner associations must be submitted to the director of development services or designee. If an encroachment is specifically addressed in another section of this chapter, the more specific section applies. Petitions must be accompanied by a non-refundable $100.00 processing fee. The director may process permit requests and may establish terms and procedures to carry out this section. Permits under this section may be issued by the director without specific city commission action to an owner of property abutting the right-of-way to be encroached upon or to a property-owners association seeking to improve nearby right-of-way. 
(b)  Encroachments eligible for permits under this section are not limited to structures primarily on private property abutting public streets or alleys, but also include irrigation systems, non-commercial signs and structures for such signs and other independent installations otherwise meeting the requirements of this section. 
(c)  Any encroachment obstructing public passage, utility facilities, or other uses of public streets or alleys is ineligible for a permit. 
(d)  The property owner or petitioner shall make an application on a form prescribed by the city and such application shall provide a list of requirements for submittal. 
(e)  Petitioner must pay a $500.00 permit fee when the permit is issued. The director may specify the construction, characteristics, quality, and placement of abutting encroachments. The city commission may require relocation or removal of an encroachment when appropriate for the efficient use of the public street or alley. The petitioner is responsible for the cost associated with relocation or removal. 
(f)  The only mechanism to provide rights more secure than a permit that the city can provide is a release of the city's right-of-way interest in the affected property. A petitioner insisting on rights more secure than a permit may request the director to present to city commission a request for such a release upon paying a $100.00 application fee. The director should present the request to the city commission without recommendation and inform the commission that the request is a deviation from normal processes. If the city commission approves the release, the petitioner must also pay the city an amount equal to what the city would pay if the affected property were in private hands and the city were acquiring it for street right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-50, § 1, 10-6-15) 
Sec. 139-5. - Governmental-related agreements. 
(a)  Petitions for inter-jurisdictional agreements or joint use agreements by other governmental jurisdictions and by utility agencies for use of city property must be submitted to the director of development services. 
(b)  The director may process requests and may establish forms and procedures to carry out this section and may charge a $500.00 processing fee. Agreements under this section must either be recorded or described in a recorded memorandum of agreement. For the purposes of this section, city property does not include utility easements or public streets or alleys that utility agencies are otherwise permitted by law to use. Nothing in this section alters the rights and obligations of the city and utility agencies in street repairs, widenings, and rerouting. 
(c)  As to city fee-owned property, if petitioners pay fair market value for the property used, their rights are governed by this section. All petitioners other than utility agencies must apply under this section. Rights granted under this section have indefinite duration and may be terminated only by action of city commission. 
(d)  The area subject to the agreement must be as wide as reasonably necessary to maintain the line, but not less than ten feet. For the purpose of calculating the payment due, the minimum licensed area is 600 square feet. 
(e)  As to city fee-owned property, if petitioners do not pay fair market value for the property used, their rights are governed by this section. Rights granted under this section have indefinite duration and may be terminated only by action of city commission. If city commission terminates a utility agency's rights under an agreement subject to this section, the utility agency must, at its own expense, find an alternate place for its facilities and remove and relocate the facilities. 
(f)  As to property in which the city owns only an easement, the petitioner need not pay more than the processing fee provided for above. The agreement may impose limitations on the proposed use to assure city easement rights are not interfered with and is terminable only if the use interferes with city's easement rights. 
(g)  No agreement under this section grants the right to trespass on or otherwise use property in which person's other than the city have an interest. When the city does not own the fee or another owns an easement, petitioner must get consent from the owner of all non-city interests. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-50, § 1, 10-6-15) 
Sec. 139-6. - Use of city easement property by private properties. 
(a)  Petitions for use of property over which the city owns an easement, other than by the owner of the fee underlying an easement, must be submitted to the director of development services or designee. The director may process requests and may establish forms and procedures to carry out this section. This section does not apply to public street, alley, sidewalk, plaza, or other public area easements. 
(b)  Petitioner need pay only an administrative fee of $500.00. The agreement may impose limitations on the proposed use to assure city easement rights are not interfered with. Rights under an agreement subject to this section have indefinite duration, and they may be terminated only if the use interferes with city's easement rights. 
(c)  A director may, without city commission action, approve agreements conforming to this section and not impairing the city's rights in the affected property. Termination may be by the director without council action. One whose rights are terminated by the director may appeal to the city commission by sending written notice of such appeal to the director. The director must then act with reasonable dispatch to put the appeal on city commission's agenda. One appealing a termination is responsible for monitoring upcoming city commission agenda to learn when the commission will take the appeal up. 
(d)  No agreement under this section grants the right to trespass on or otherwise use property in which persons other than the city have an interest. Petitioner must get consent from the owner of all non-city interests. 
(e)  Owners of the fee underlying city easements need not apply for rights under this chapter. In no event may an underlying owner's use of the fee impair the city's easement rights. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-50, § 1, 10-6-15) 
Sec. 139-7. - Licenses for petrochemical pipelines on city property. 
(a)  Uses of public right-of-way or other city property for petrochemical pipelines must be licensed under this section. Petitions for such licenses must be submitted to the director of development services. The director may process licenses, requests and may establish forms and procedures conducive to carrying out this section. 
(b)  The non-refundable license processing fee for each petition is $5,000.00. 
(c)  Except as provided below, the license fee for the first year of a pipeline license is the fair market value of the licensed area. The fee for each succeeding year is the previous year's fee multiplied times 1.04. Licenses do not exceed ten years. 
(d)  The licensed area must be as wide as the petitioner will reasonably need to maintain the pipeline, but not less than five feet. For the purpose of calculating the fee, the minimum licensed area is 300 square feet. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-50, § 1, 10-6-15; Ord. No. O-2017-42, § 1, 9-18-17) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-2017-42, § 1, adopted September 18, 2017, repealed the former § 139-7, and renumbered §§ 139-8-139-15 as 139-7-139-14. The historical notation remains with the renumbered provisions. The former § 139-7 pertained to licensing for fiber optic cable installation and derived from Ord. No. O-2015-50, § 1, adopted October 6, 2015. Similar provisions can be found in § 139-15. 
Sec. 139-8. - Closure, vacation, and abandonment of public right-of-way. 
(a)  Petitions for closure, vacation, and abandonment of public streets or alleys must be submitted to the director of development services. The director may process requests and may establish forms and procedures to carry out this section. 
(b)  Petitioner must demonstrate ownership of each abutting property and must submit at least a standard land survey with field notes for each abutting-property owner's portion of the affected public rights-of-way. All owners of abutting property must consent to the action under this section. The consent must be in writing and may be by quitclaim deed. Unless petitioner demonstrates that city owns the right-of-way in fee, city will assume the right-of-way exists by easement. 
(c)  Fees for closures, vacations, or abandonments are: 
(1)  A non-refundable processing fee of $300.00; and 
(2)  The fair market value of the right-of-way segment being closed, vacated or abandoned. 
(d)  The director may require a petitioner to sign and deliver an agreement setting out the applicable closure fee and conditions imposed by city departments and utility agencies. 
(e)  Not later than ten days before the planning and zoning commission takes up a proposed closure, vacation, or abandonment, the director must cause signs to be placed at or near the public right-of-way to be closed. The signs must state the proposed action and the location and dates of the planning commission and city council action and must remain in place until city council acts on the petition. Signs need not be erected for undeveloped ("paper") public right-of-way or for slivers not affecting the path of public travel. In addition to the processing fee, the director may require a petitioner to deposit up front the reasonable cost of procuring, installing, and removing the signs. 
(f)  Not later than ten days before the planning and zoning commission takes up a proposed closure, vacation or abandonment, the director must cause letters to be sent out to the persons the director reasonably believes to be owners of all tracts within 500 feet of any portion of the affected right-of-way. In determining ownership of tracts, the director need not inquire further than the ownership listings by Hidalgo County Appraisal District. Letters need not be sent for paper public right-of-way or for slivers not affecting the path of public travel. 
(g)  Closing, vacating, and abandoning public right-of-way must be approved by ordinance. Opposition by neighborhood groups may be considered by planning and zoning commission and city commission, but such opposition is not a basis for the director to fail to process a petition.

Sec. 1.6. - Purpose of the use districts. 
    The purpose of the use districts described herein is to group together into districts those uses that are reasonably compatible with one another according to their normal characteristics of operation: 
A.  To permit, in connection with these uses, those customary and necessary accessory activities which are incidental to the principal use; and 
B.  To permit certain other uses which may be established in some situations and subject to specific conditions so that such special uses will also be compatible with the uses allowed as a matter of right; and 
C.  To promote orderly, timely, economical growth and to recognize current land use conditions; and 
D.  To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for development to meet the present and future growth needs of the city, with allowance for a diversity of sites; and 
E.  To protect use areas, as far as possible, against heavy and unnecessary through traffic; and 
F.  To protect use areas against pollution, environmental hazards, and other objectionable influences; and 
G.  To protect use areas against congestion, as far as possible, by managing the density of population in and around them; by providing for proper off-street parking spaces; and by providing open areas for rest and recreation and to break the monotony of continuous building bulk, thus providing a more desirable environment; and 
H.  To provide for privacy and access of light and air to windows and to all devices that are powered or heated by the sun, as far as possible, through controls over the spacing and height of buildings and other structures; and 
I.  To promote the most appropriate use of land and direction of building development which is not in conflict with the comprehensive plan or the adopted policies of the city; to promote stability of development; to protect the character of the districts; to conserve the value of land and buildings; and protect the city's tax base; and 
J.  To promote the most efficient use of city facilities and services; and 
K.  To protect against fire and explosions and other safety hazards, and to provide for fire protection and access by fire equipment and vehicles; and 
L.  To accommodate use activities and operations whose external physical effects are restricted to the area of the district, and in no manner affect in a detrimental way any of the surrounding districts.

Sec. 1.15. - R-3 medium-density multifamily residential district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  The R-3 medium-density multifamily district is established to provide adequate space and site diversification for medium-density areas that are a mixture of single-family, duplex, and multifamily dwelling units of up to eight units per lot. 
2.  This is a zone for transitional areas developed for single-family usage, but because of the need for rehabilitation, or changes in the character of the neighborhood, are now deemed suitable for some multifamily development. 
3.  The area requirements in this district are based on multifamily dwelling units being built on smaller, individual lots and needing to coexist with single-family residences. Only one building will be allowed per lot, and the setbacks will be similar to that of the single-family district. 
4.  This zone allows medium-density developments, and should be located where additional requirements for streets, water and fire protection, wastewater, drainage, and adequate open space are met. R-3 uses should not run traffic over long distances of single-family residential-sized streets, or through single-family neighborhoods, and should be located close to arterials or collectors capable of carrying the additional traffic. 
5.  Multifamily developments are not a buffer between single-family and commercial uses, and should be properly buffered from nonresidential land uses and traffic, or from pollution and/or environmental hazards. 
B.  Permitted uses: 
1.  One single-family, detached dwelling per lot, except guesthouses. Structures must meet the area requirements of the R-1 district. 
2.  One building containing two to eight dwelling units. Duplexes must meet area requirements of the R-2 district. 
3.  Condominiums containing two to eight dwelling units. 
4.  One townhouse per lot. Structures must meet the area requirements of R-TH district. 
5.  Paved parking lots for multifamily residential use. 
6.  Public and private directional signs, official signs, political signs, nameplates or real estate signs. 
7.  Church and other permitted institutions' signs showing names, activities, and service therein provided. 
8.  During construction of a building, one unilluminated sign advertising contractors or architects on such buildings, provided such sign is less than eight square feet in area, provided that signs shall recognize customary setback lines and be removed immediately after completion of such building. 
9.  Storage buildings including portable buildings not larger than 120 square feet of floor area and ten feet in height, and accessory buildings. 
10.  Temporary real estate sales offices located on property being sold, or temporary on-site construction offices, limited to the period of sale, construction, or two years, whichever is less. 
11.  Nurseries, greenhouses, and gardens where the products are not to be sold. 
12.  Day care centers with less than six children enrolled at any one time, except in townhouses. 
13.  Paved automobile parking areas which are necessary to the uses permitted in this district. 
14.  An accessory use customarily related to a principal use authorized in this district. 
C.  Conditional uses (require use permits, see article III): 
1.  Institutional, including day care centers with six children or more enrolled, or in townhouses. 
2.  Home occupations, as defined in this ordinance. 
3.  Associated recreation. 
4.  Guesthouses, or separate servants' quarters. 
5.  A mobile home on an unsubdivided tract of five acres or more. 
6.  Boardinghouses. 
7.  Facilities for railroads or those utilities holding a franchise under the City of Pharr.

9.  Paved parking facilities for nonresidential uses. 
10.  Real estate sales offices or on-site construction offices for more than two years, or occupying mobile homes. 
D.  Prohibited uses: 
1.  Any building erected or land used for other than one or more of the preceding specified uses. 
2.  The storage of equipment, material or vehicles, including abandoned vehicles, which are not necessary to the uses permitted in this district. 
3.  On- and off-premises signs, portable signs, animated or illuminated signs. 
4.  A driveway or crosswalk way, as distinct from a dedicated street, to provide access to premises in a commercial or industrial district. 
5.  Any use of property that does not meet the required minimum lot size; front, side and rear yard dimension; and/or lot width; or exceeds the maximum height, building coverage or density per gross acre as required. 
E.  Area requirements: 
1.  Single-family dwelling units shall meet the requirements of the R-1 district. Only one single-family residential structure will be allowed per lot. 
2.  Townhouses shall meet the requirements of the R-TH district. Only one townhouse will be allowed per lot. 
3.  Duplexes shall meet the requirements of the R-2 district. 
4.  Minimum lot area: 
a.  Single-family usage: 6,000 square feet. 
b.  Duplex and tri-plex usage: 7,500 square feet. 
c.  Four-plex usage: 8,000 square feet. 
d.  Five thru eight apartments: 9,000 square feet. 
5.  Maximum number of residential buildings per lot, one. 
6.  Maximum number of dwelling units per lot: 
a.  Zero-, one- or two-bedroom or efficiency dwelling units, 1,500 square feet of lot area per unit. 
b.  Three- or more bedroom dwelling units, 1,750 square feet of lot area per unit. 
To determine the permitted number of dwelling units in the R-3 district, divide the area of the parcel in question by the "minimum lot area per dwelling unit." The resulting quotient is the maximum number of dwelling units permitted. 
i.e.: 
90' × 100' lot = 9,000 square feet. 
9,000 square feet of lot area ° 1,500 square feet = 6 efficiency apartments. 
The maximum number on a 9,000-square foot lot = 6 efficiencies. 
9,000 square feet of lot area: 1,500 square feet = 6 efficiency apartments, 6 one-bedroom apartments, or 6 two-bedroom apartments. 
9,000 square feet of lot area: 1,750 square feet = 5 three-bedroom units. 
7.  Maximum density per acre: 
a.  Zero-, one- or two-bedroom or efficiency dwelling units, 29 dwelling units per net acre. 
b.  Three- or more bedroom dwelling units, 24 dwelling units per net acre. 
8.  Minimum lot frontage on a public street, 70 feet. 
9.  Minimum lot depth, 100 feet. 
10.  Minimum depth of front setback, 20 feet. 
11.  Minimum depth of rear setback, [5] 15 feet. 
12.  Minimum width of side setback: 
a.  Internal lot, seven feet or ten percent of the lot width, whichever is greater. 
b.  Side yard setback abutting street, 15 feet. 
13.  Minimum distance between buildings on the same lot or parcel of land, 14 feet. 
14.  Minimum distance from the public right-of-way to the entrance to a garage or enclosed carport, unless otherwise specified by the planning and zoning commission, 18 feet. 
15.  Maximum building coverage as a percentage of lot area, 50 percent. 
16.  Minimum amount of permanent, landscaped open space, ten percent. 
17.  Maximum height of structures, 36 feet or 21/2 stories. 
18.  Minimum number of paved, striped, off-street parking spaces required for: 
a.  Zero-bedroom or efficiency dwelling unit, 1.0 spaces per unit. 
b.  One-bedroom dwelling units, 1.5 spaces per unit. 
c.  Two-bedroom dwelling units, 1.75 spaces per unit. 
d.  Three- or more bedroom dwelling units, 2.0 spaces per unit. 
e.  All other uses, see "Off-Street Parking," article IV.

Sec. 1.16. - R-4 high-density multifamily residential district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  The R-4 high-density multifamily district is established to provide adequate space and site diversification for higher density apartment complexes, including high-rise apartments and complexes with a number of buildings on the same tract of land. 
2.  This is a zone for areas that have large unbroken tracts of land suitable for development as large complexes. It is not intended for areas already subdivided into lots, and it is anticipated that developments in this zone will have to plat the property as a whole as part of the development process. 
3.  Traditional area requirements are inappropriate for this district, so setbacks from lot lines are minimal and there are no restrictions as to the number of residential buildings that may be placed on a lot. Height limitations are also relaxed, except when abutting single-family uses. More reliance is placed on square footage per dwelling unit, lot coverage, open space and parking ratios to control density, thereby allowing more flexibility in the design of such projects. 
4.  This zone allows higher density developments, and should be located where internal streets are wider than single-family sized streets, and where there is increased water capacity, fire protection, wastewater and drainage capacity. Adequate open space should be within walking distance (approximately one-fourth mile). Areas should not be zoned to this usage unless they are located on or close to arterials or collectors capable of carrying the additional traffic they will generate. The traffic generated by such uses should not travel through lower density residential areas. 
5.  Higher density multifamily developments are not a buffer between single-family and commercial uses, and should be properly buffered from nonresidential uses, and protected from high volumes of nonresidential traffic, or from pollution and/or environmental hazards. 
B.  Permitted uses: 
1.  One single-family detached dwelling per lot, except guesthouses. Structures must meet the area requirements of the R-1 district. 
2.  One building containing two to eight dwelling units per lot. Duplexes must meet the area requirements of the R-2 district. 
3.  Apartments and condominiums. 
4.  One townhouse per lot. Structures must meet the area requirements of the R-TH district. 
5.  Paved parking lots for multifamily residential use, and other uses permitted in this district. 
6.  Public and private directional signs, official signs, political signs, nameplates or real estate signs. 
7.  Church and other permitted institutions' signs showing names, activities and services therein provided. 
8.  During construction of a building, one unilluminated sign advertising contractors or architects on such buildings, provided such sign is less than eight square feet in area, provided that signs shall recognize customary setback lines and be removed immediately after completion of such building. 
9.  Storage buildings including portable buildings not larger than 120 square feet of floor area and ten feet in height, and accessory buildings. 
10.  Temporary real estate sales offices located on property being sold, or temporary on-site construction offices limited to the period of sale, construction or two years, whichever is less. 
11.  Nurseries, greenhouses, and gardens where the products are not to be sold. 
12.  Day care centers with less than six children enrolled at any one time, except in townhouses. 
13.  An accessory use customarily related to a principal use authorized in this district. 
C.  Conditional uses (require use permits, see article III): 
1.  Institutional, including day care centers, with six children or more enrolled, or in townhouses. 
2.  Home occupations as defined in this ordinance. 
3.  Associated recreation and/or community clubs. 
4.  Guesthouses, or separate servants' quarters. 
5.  A mobile home on an unsubdivided tract of five acres or more. 
6.  Facilities for railroads or those utilities holding a franchise under the city. 
7.  Portable buildings or storage buildings larger than 120 square feet of floor area and ten feet in height used as accessory to residential use. 
8.  Paved parking facilities for nonresidential uses. 
9.  One zero lot line or patio home per lot. 
10.  Real estate sale offices or on-site construction offices for more than two years, or occupying mobile homes. 
D.  Prohibited uses: 
1.  Any building erected or land used for other than one or more of the preceding specified uses. 
2.  The storage of equipment, material or vehicles, including abandoned vehicles which are not necessary to the uses permitted in this district. 
3.  On- and off-premises signs, portable signs, animated or illuminated signs. 
4.  A driveway or crosswalk way, as distinct from a dedicated street, to provide access to premises in a commercial or industrial district. 
5.  Any use of property that does not meet the required minimum lot size; front, side and rear yard dimension; and/or lot width; or exceeds the maximum height, building coverage or density per gross acre as required. 
E.  Area requirements: 
1.  Single-family dwelling units shall meet the area requirements of the R-1 district. Only one single-family residential structure will be allowed per lot. 
2.  Townhouses shall meet the area requirements of the R-TH district. Only one townhouse will be allowed per lot. 
3.  Minimum lot area, 18,000 square feet. All lots in this district must have approved wastewater disposal systems. 
4.  Maximum number of dwelling units per lot: 
a.  Zero-bedroom or efficiency dwelling units, 1,000 square feet of lot area per unit. 
b.  One-bedroom dwelling units, 1,250 square feet of lot per unit. 
c.  Two-bedroom dwelling units, 1,500 square feet of lot per unit. 
d.  Three- or more bedroom dwelling units, 1,750 square feet of lot area per unit. 
To determine the permitted number of dwelling units in the R-4 district, divide the area of the parcel in question by the "minimum lot area per dwelling unit." The resulting quotient is the maximum number of dwelling units permitted. 
i.e.: 
150' × 120' lot = 18,000 square feet. 
18,000 square feet of lot area ° 1,000 square feet = 18 efficiency apartments. 
The maximum number on an 18,000-square foot lot = 18 efficiencies. 
18,000 square feet of lot area ° 1,250 square feet = 14 one-bedroom apartments. 
18,000 square feet of lot area ° 1,500 square feet = 12 two-bedroom apartments. 
18,000 square feet of lot area ° 1,750 square feet = 10 three-bedroom apartments. 
5.  Maximum density per acre: [6] 
a.  Zero-bedroom or efficiency dwelling units, 43 dwelling units per net acre. 
b.  One-bedroom dwelling units, 34 dwelling units per net acre. 
c.  Two-bedroom dwelling units, 29 dwelling units per net acre. 
d.  Three- or more bedroom dwelling units, 24 dwelling units per net acre. 
6.  Minimum lot frontage on a public street, 70 feet.

11.  Minimum distance between buildings on the same lot or parcel of land, 12 feet and an additional one foot for every two feet in height above 35 feet of either structure. 
12.  Minimum distance from the public right-of-way to the entrance to a garage or enclosed carport, unless otherwise specified by the planning and zoning commission, 18 feet. 
13.  Maximum building coverage as a percentage of lot area, 50 percent. 
14.  Minimum amount of permanent, landscaped open space, ten percent. 
15.  Maximum height of structures, where a structure exceeds 36 feet in height, it shall be set back one additional foot for every two feet above 36 feet. 
16.  Minimum number of paved, striped off-street parking spaces required for: 
a.  Zero-bedroom or efficiency dwelling unit, 1.0 space per unit. 
b.  One-bedroom dwelling units, 1.5 spaces per unit. 
c.  Two-bedroom dwelling units, 1.75 spaces per unit. 
d.  Three- or more bedroom dwelling units, 2.0 spaces per unit. 
e.  All other uses, see "Off-Street Parking," article IV. 
17.  Lots with more than five dwelling units that have a side or rear contiguous to an R-1, R-TH, R-2 district, must be separated by a buffer as herein defined. Must also meet the requirements of article V. 
18.  See article VII for modifications and exceptions. 
F.  Required conditions: 
1.  Any owner, builder, or developer of a multiple-family, condominium or townhouse dwelling complex of eight units or more on a single lot or parcel or eight or more single-family townhouse attached units, shall submit to the planning and zoning commission for a review, the site and building plan for the proposed development.

[Sec. 1.17. - Reserved.] 
Sec. 1.18. - R-MH mobile home district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  The R-MH mobile home district is established to provide adequate space and site diversification for mobile home parks and subdivisions. The city recognizes that the mobile home is a viable alternative to the typical single-family residence, and will not discriminate against mobile homes. 
2.  Mobile homes are typically built outside the city limits of Pharr, and do not meet the same building code requirements as the single-family structure. Mobile home parks or subdivisions will, therefore, be allowed to locate near other residential neighborhoods, but individual mobile homes will not be allowed on lots within other residential-type neighborhoods. 
3.  Mobile home lots have different area requirements than spaces in a mobile home park. In addition, mobile home subdivisions have public streets and utilities, built to city standards, whereas mobile home parks do not. While mobile home parks and subdivisions fall under the same zoning category, a mobile home park will not be allowed to convert to a subdivision until the area requirements of a mobile home subdivision have been met, the requirements of the subdivision ordinance have been met and a plat has been approved. 
4.  Unlike the other districts, the city will not zone areas for mobile home usage in advance unless asked to do so by the property owners. This district could, therefore, be considered a "floating zone" and must be "rezoned" to this use. Care must be taken to ensure that the needs for areas zoned for mobile homes are met and that this form of housing is not discriminated against in the rezoning process. 
5.  Mobile home developments are a low- to medium-density use, and have the same additional requirements for streets, water, fire protection, wastewater, drainage and open space as townhouse and duplexes. 
6.  Mobile home developments are not a buffer between single-family and commercial uses, and should be properly buffered from nonresidential uses, and protected from high volumes of nonsingle-family traffic, or from pollution and/or environmental hazards. When properly buffered, a mobile home park should not have an adverse impact on adjacent residential areas or their property values. 
7.  An R-MH district shall not be permitted in the City of Pharr, Texas, after the effective date of amendatory Ordinance No. O-2002-24. 
8.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, mobile homes shall not be permitted in an R-MH zoning district or any other zoning district after the effective date of amendatory Ordinance No. O-2002-24, except to replace an existing mobile home in an existing R-MH zoning district. 
B.  Permitted uses: 
1.  One mobile home or vehicle per lot, whether residential or recreational; or one site-built, single-family home per lot, provided that single-family, site-built homes are permitted under any applicable deed restrictions that are in full force and effect at the time of adoption of this amendatory ordinance.

Sec. 1.19. - R-HCMH HUD-Code manufactured home district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  The R-HCMH HUD-Code manufactured home district is established to provide residents with a residential alternative to R-1 single-family residential districts which allow only site-built, single-family residential dwellings. 
2.  HUD-Code manufactured homes are constructed off-site and typically do not meet the same building code requirements applicable to site-built, single-family structures, but do meet building standards and requirements adopted by the State of Texas for the construction of HUD-Code manufactured homes in compliance with the federal standards and requirements established under Title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, entitled the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. 
3.  HUD-Code manufactured home subdivisions have public streets and utilities built to city standards, whereas one lot subdivision parks do not. While HUD-Code manufactured home parks and subdivisions fall under the same zoning category, a one lot subdivision park will not be allowed to convert to a subdivision with more than one lot until the area requirements of a HUD-Code manufactured home subdivision have been met, the requirements of the subdivision ordinance have been met and a plat has been approved. 
4.  Unlike the other districts, the city will not zone areas for HUD-Code manufactured home usage in advance unless asked to do so by the property owners. This district could, therefore, be considered a "floating zone" and must be "rezoned" to this use. 
5.  HUD-Code manufactured home developments are a low-to medium-density use, and are subject to the same development standards as R-1 residential subdivisions. 
6.  HUD-Code manufactured home developments are not a buffer between single family and commercial uses, and should be properly buffered from nonresidential uses, and protected from high volumes of nonsingle-family traffic, or from pollution and/or environmental hazards. When properly buffered, a HUD-Code manufactured park should not have an adverse impact on adjacent residential areas or their property values. 
R-HCMH SUBDIVISIONS: 
A HUD-Code manufactured home subdivision shall meet all the requirements of the City of Pharr Subdivision Ordinance [chapter 118 of the Code of Ordinances], and any applicable sections of the City of Pharr Manufactured Home and Trailer Ordinance [chapter 78]. Such subdivision shall have as its major purpose the sales and conveyance of property rights and ownership of individual lots to consumers, while not prohibiting rentals. 
A.  Permitted uses: 
1.  One HUD-Code manufactured home per lot, and accessory uses. The home must be skirted. 
2.  One detached single-family dwelling per lot; site built home must meet all the requirements of the R-1 district. 
3.  Public and private directional signs, official signs, political signs, nameplates or real estate signs. 
4.  Church and other permitted institutions' signs showing names, activities and services therein provided. 
5.  Portable storage buildings not larger than 120 square feet of floor area and ten feet in height. 
6.  Nurseries, greenhouses and gardens, where products are not to be sold. 
7.  Day care centers with less than six children enrolled at any one time. 
B.  Conditional uses (require use permits, see article III): 
1.  Institutional uses, including all day care centers with more than six children enrolled at any one time.

3.  Associated recreation and commercial activities. 
4.  Portable buildings and storage buildings larger than 120 square feet of floor area and ten feet in height used as an accessory to the residential use. 
5.  Facilities for railroads or those utilities holding a franchise under the City of Pharr. 
6.  Paved parking facilities for nonresidential uses. 
7.  A paved storage area for unoccupied recreational vehicles and equipment, such as boats and canoes, which must have a fence and a buffer as defined to separate and protect adjacent residential uses. 
8.  Real estate sales offices or temporary construction offices for more than two years. 
C.  Prohibited uses: 
1.  Any building erected or land used for other than one or more of the preceding specified uses. 
2.  The storage of equipment, material or vehicles, including abandoned vehicles, which are not necessary to the uses permitted in this district, except as noted in section 1.18 B.7. 
3.  On- and off-premises signs portable signs animated or illuminated signs. 
4.  A driveway or crosswalk way, as distinct from a dedicated street, to provide access to premises in a commercial or industrial district. 
5.  Any use of property that does not meet the required minimum lot size; front, side and rear yard dimension; and/or lot width; or exceeds the maximum height, building coverage or density per gross acre as required. 
D.  Area requirements: 
1.  Minimum size of tract for development, ten lots.

In a HUD-Code manufactured home or recreational vehicle park, 50 percent of such parking may be provided within 200 feet of the spaces that require the parking. 

Sec. 1.20. - OP office and professional district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  The OP office and professional district is established to create a restrictive district for "clean," attractive, low-intensity office or professional uses, and is considered the "highest" commercial district. 
2.  The uses allowed in this district should not have a blighting effect on adjacent residential areas, and may be located close to all types of residential uses, with appropriate buffers and landscaping. Uses with excessive amounts of traffic, noise, or litter, or with late-night hours are not suitable for this district. 
3.  Because the uses in this district are intended to be low-intensity uses that are compatible with residential areas and will not create excessive amounts of traffic, it may be suitable for shallow depth lots or residential sized lots along a major thoroughfare when developed in accordance with the comprehensive plan. Uses in this district may also be located on streets with potential congestion problems. 
4.  The low-intensity commercial uses allowed in this district are still more intensive than nearly all types of residential developments. Areas should not be zoned to this usage unless they are located on or close to arterials or collectors capable of carrying the additional traffic they will generate, and where there is increased water, fire protection, wastewater, and drainage capacity. Although such uses may locate adjacent to residential areas, they still must be buffered and landscaped to protect such adjacent areas. The traffic from such uses should not travel any long distances over residential sized streets or through residential areas. 
5.  In order to encourage a high standard of office development and to make sure such uses are compatible with adjacent residential districts, the area requirements are more restrictive than for office development in other districts, especially when such uses abut residential areas. This district does allow, however, high-rise office complexes when the setbacks are sufficient and the buildings are located far enough from a residential district. 
B.  Permitted uses: 
1.  Office buildings for professional occupations including: executive, administrative, legal, accounting, writing, clerical, stenographic, drafting, and real estate. 
2.  Medical offices, including clinics, where activities are conducted within a totally enclosed building. 
3.  Other uses similar to the above. 
4.  An accessory use customarily related to a principal use authorized in this district such as a pharmacy or apothecary shop, stores limited to corrective garments or bandages, or optical company or eating establishments accessory to the office complex for the convenience of the occupants and clients may be permitted, provided it is within the building to which it is accessory and does not have a direct outside entrance for customers. 
5.  Drive-ins that are accessory to permitted uses in this district. 
6.  Paved parking lots. 
a.  Provisions for the parking of vehicles may be incidental to the primary use. Such use located within 60 feet of a residential zone must be separated from said lot by a solid buffer fence, must be paved and at a minimum of 35,000 square feet in lot size. If parking of vehicles requires the transport of vehicles to destination, such vehicles must be transported in a light duty weight class truck and cannot exceed 10,000 GVWR (pounds). 
7.  On-premises signs, illuminated or animated, in accordance with adopted city ordinances and codes. 
8.  Agricultural uses on unplatted land, in accordance with all adopted city ordinances and codes. 
C.  Conditional uses (require use permits, see article III):

15.  Maximum number of entrances and/or exits: 
a.  On arterial streets, one per site per each 200 feet of street frontage. 
b.  On collector streets, one per site per each 100 feet of street frontage. 
c.  On local streets, one per site per each 50 feet of street frontage. 
16.  Lots with nonresidential uses that have a side or rear contiguous or separated only by an alley, or easement or street, from any residential district must be separated from such residential district by a buffer as defined.

Section 1.20 contained two subsections designated C. To avoid confusion, the editor has designated the second of the two as C.1. 

Sec. 1.21. - NC neighborhood commercial district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  The NC neighborhood commercial district is established as a limited retail category intended for use near neighborhood areas for the purpose of supplying day-to-day retail needs of the residents in the area. The city will not zone for NC usage in advance unless asked to do so by the property owner. This district could, therefore, be considered a "floating zone." 
2.  The NC district shall occur only at corner locations if both intersecting streets are minor arterials or larger as identified in the comprehensive land use plan. 
3.  Since the site is typically small, and surrounded by residential type land uses, this zoning would have the appearance of a spot zone. It is not an illegal spot zone, however, if it is called for in the comprehensive plan, or if it serves a need in the neighborhood. 
4.  While the NC district may gradually expand away from the intersection, it must begin at one of the four corner sites. 
5.  Care must be taken to ensure that adjacent residential uses are protected. Uses with excessive amounts of traffic, noise, or litter are not intended for this district. The area, landscaping, and buffering requirements are more restrictive in this district in order to protect adjacent uses. 
B.  Permitted uses: Planned neighborhood convenience centers with any of the following permitted uses, provided the site is not larger than three acres: 
1.  Generally recognized retail businesses which supply commodities on the premises for persons residing in adjacent residential areas, such as groceries, meats, dairy products, baked goods, gasoline and similar items. 
2.  Personal services establishments that perform services on the premises such as: beauty parlor, barbershop, shoe repair and self-service laundries, and similar uses, but not including automotive, armature and appliance repair services, and similar type uses. 
3.  Personal services including the following: outpatient medical clinics, offices of doctors, dentists, and similar or allied professions. 
4.  On-premises signs, including those that are illuminated. All signs must be attached to the building and not project more than 12 inches. 
C.  Conditional uses (require use permits, see article III): 
1.  A mobile home used as a temporary office. Not to exceed six months. 
2.  Business establishments which perform services on the premises such as banks, loan companies, insurance and real estate offices. 
3.  Planned neighborhood convenience centers of over three acres. 
4.  Accessory structures (including portable buildings) and uses customarily incidental to the above-permitted uses. 
D.  Required conditions: 
1.  All retail and business establishments must conduct their business within a completely enclosed building except for retail outlets where gasoline products are sold. 
2.  Gasoline service stations or retail outlets where gasoline products are sold at retail prices are limited in their activity to the sale of gasoline, oil and minor accessories only. No repair service is to be performed on the premises. 
3.  Veterinary hospitals or clinics are subject to the limitation that all activities be conducted within a totally enclosed building with no open area impoundment and no external effects such as noise or odor. 
E.  Prohibited uses:

[Secs. 1.22, 1.23. - Reserved.] 
Sec. 1.24. - C-2 business district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  The business district is established to accommodate the existing development in the central area of the city, and to protect the character of this area. It recognizes the unique characteristics of the downtown and its space limitations. 
2.  The use of this district should be limited to those areas that are currently developed as the downtown. Areas that do not have additional on-street parking to make up for the lack of off-street parking, that do not have any trouble meeting the requirements of the general business district, or that are on the fringe of the C-2 district should be zoned general business district, and meet the additional area requirements. 
3.  Existing uses that are part of the C-2 business district require less area and off-street parking requirements since the properties in this district have a very high floor area ratio, and very little additional land for landscaping, off-street parking, and setbacks. 
B.  Permitted uses: 
1.  Generally recognized retail businesses which supply commodities on the premises, such as groceries, meats, dairy products, baked goods, clothing and notions, or hardware and similar uses. 
2.

5.  Restaurants. 
6.  Hotels and motels. 
7.  Sale of liquor, subject to all other adopted ordinances. 
8.  On-premises signs, including those that are animated or illuminated. 
9.  Paved commercial parking lots. 
10.  Other uses similar to the above. 
C.  Conditional uses (require use permits, see article III):

5.  Accessory structures and uses customarily incidental to the above-permitted uses. 
6.  Portable buildings. 
7.  Restaurants selling or distributing alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption. Conditional use permits shall be issued to such establishments only if the applicant agrees to comply with all applicable zoning requirements and conditions.

D.  Required conditions: 
1.  All business establishments other than those selling a service shall be retail service establishments dealing directly with customers. All goods produced on the premises shall be sold at retail prices on premises where produced.

Repair work, steam cleaning or undercoating, vehicle body repair, painting, tire recapping, engine rebuilding, auto dismantling, upholstery, auto glasswork, and such other activities whose external effects could adversely extend beyond the property line are not permitted. 
4.  Veterinary hospitals and clinics are subject to the limitation that all activities be conducted within a totally enclosed building with no open area impoundment and no external effects such as noise or odor which could adversely extend beyond the property lines. 
E.  Prohibited uses: 
1.  Any building erected or land used for other than one or more of the preceding specified uses. 
2.  Off-premises signs.

Sec. 1.25. - C general business district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  The general business district is established to provide adequate space and site diversification for most types of commercial development in the City of Pharr. Larger shopping centers and most of the existing commercial strips along major arterials would be included in this district. The uses specified in this district include most types of retail activity and some wholesale with the exception of those uses which are not compatible with the retail shopping function. For example, lumberyards, contractor yards, and warehousing with high volumes of truck traffic and low volumes of retail-type traffic are not included in this district. 
2.  This district will be the major retail district, with intensive commercial uses and large volumes of retail traffic. The noise, traffic, litter, late-night hours, and possible blighting influences require adequate buffering from residential areas, and the traffic from such uses should not pass through residential areas, except on arterials or major collectors. 
3.  Areas should not be zoned to this usage unless they are located on or close to arterials or major collectors capable of carrying the additional traffic they will generate, and in areas where there is increased water, fire protection, wastewater and drainage capacity. 
4.  This zone is the general business zone, and it is intended that most commercial uses fall in this district, with the exception of the heavy commercial type uses. Since the zone is of a general nature, the area requirements are less stringent and do not require as high a standard of development as the OP and NC districts. 
B.  Permitted uses: 
1.  Office buildings. 
2.  Any retail businesses, personal services, professional services, business services conducted within a completely enclosed building, except the following: lumberyards or contractor yards, farm equipment or other heavy equipment sales or services, farm products warehousing and storage or stockyards, general warehousing or storage. Household goods warehousing and storage in individually rented storage units is permitted. 
3.  Planned shopping centers and neighborhood convenience centers. 
4.  Hotel, motel and/or eating places. 
5.  Drive-in businesses. 
6.  Printing, publishing, and allied products manufacturing accessory to such use. 
7.  Rail and motor vehicle transportation passenger terminals. 
8.  Gasoline service stations, or retail outlets where gasoline products are sold. 
9.  Telephone, telegraph, television, radio or similar media stations, centers, studios, but not including public microwave, radio and television towers. 
10.  Any wholesale trade, or wholesale trade accessory to any permitted retail operation except the following: raw cotton, grain, hide, skins, and raw furs, tobacco, wool or mohair, livestock, commercial or industrial machinery or supplies, metals and minerals, petroleum bulk stations and terminals, scrap or junk waste materials. 
11.  Signs in accordance with adopted ordinances. 
12.  Automotive repair, paint and body shops, provided all work is conducted wholly within a completely enclosed building. That portion of the land used for open storage of vehicles shall be paved and totally obscured by a wall or fence.

Conditional use permits shall be issued to such establishments only if the applicant agrees to comply with all applicable zoning requirements and conditions. If an establishment is denied a conditional use permit or has its conditional use permit revoked, such establishment may not reapply under this subsection until one day [sic] has passed since the date of the previous denial or revocation. 
D.  Prohibited uses: 
1.  Any building erected or land used for other than one or more of the preceding specified uses. 
2.  Any use of property that does not meet the required minimum lot size; front, side and rear yard dimension; and/or lot width; or exceeds the maximum height, building coverage or density per gross acre as required. 
E.  Area requirements: 
1.  Minimum site size, 9,000 square feet. 
2.  Minimum site frontage on a public street, 65 feet. 
3.  Minimum site depth, 200 feet. 
4.  Minimum depth of front setback, 20 feet or equal to one-third the street right-of-way width on which the property fronts, plus one-half the building height over 36 feet with a 50-foot maximum, whichever is greater. 
5.  Minimum width of side setback: 
a.  Without fire-retardant wall, six feet plus half the building height over 36 feet, but in no case shall more than a 50-foot side setback be required. 
b.  With a fire-retardant wall, zero feet plus half the building height over 36 feet, but in no case shall more than a 50-foot side setback be required.

(Ord. No. 84-44, § I, 7-31-84; Ord. No. 89-22, § 1, 8-1-89; Ord. No. O-91-47, § 1, 11-6-91; Ord. No. O-93-22, § 2, 8-17-93) 
Sec. 1.26. - HC heavy commercial district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  The heavy industrial commercial district is established to provide adequate space and site diversification for commercial establishments which would involve influences that would be objectionable in the other commercial districts or adjacent to residential districts. Included in this district are commercial uses that involve large volumes of truck traffic, outside operations and storage of materials and equipment, either for sale or as part of the business, excessive noise from heavy service operations, or any other possibly blighting influences. 
2.  This district is commercial in nature, but has some aspects that are similar to industrial uses. The noise, traffic, litter, late-night hours, outside storage of materials and equipment, and other possibly blighting influences require adequate buffering from residential areas, and the traffic from such uses should not pass through residential areas at all, if possible. These areas should not be located in close proximity to residential areas of any type. Residences and apartments should be discouraged from locating in this district. 
3.  Areas should not be zoned to this usage unless they are located on or close to arterials capable of carrying commercial and truck traffic. They should be located close to major truck routes. Internal streets in such developments should be sized and strengthened to accommodate truck traffic. Fire protection should be adequate for large warehouse-type operations, and the water, wastewater, and drainage systems should have enough existing capacity to support such development. 
B.  Permitted uses: 
1.  Office buildings. 
2.  Any retail business, personal services, professional services, business services. 
3.  Planned shopping centers and neighborhood convenience centers.

11.  Rail and motor vehicle transportation passenger and freight terminals, and service centers. 
12.  Any wholesale trades excluding: raw cotton, grain, hides, skins and raw furs, tobacco, wool or mohair, commercial or industrial machinery or synthetics, metals and minerals, petroleum bulk stations and terminals, packing sheds (and other raw material processing operations such as cotton gins) that are not conducted within a wholly enclosed building. 
13.  Those uses of a commercial, retail or wholesale nature requiring large outdoor loading areas, generating heavy truck or rail traffic and requiring access to major transportation channels and/or creating influences not acceptable in the C district.

E.  Area requirements: 
1.  Minimum site size, 9,000 square feet. 
2.  Minimum site frontage on a public street, 65 feet. 
3.  Minimum site depth, 200 feet.

(Ord. No. 89-22, § 1, 8-1-89; Ord. No. 89-41, § 1, 10-3-89; Ord. No. O-91-48, § 1, 11-6-91; Ord. No. O-93-22, § 3, 8-17-93) 
[Secs. 1.27-1.29. - Reserved.] 
Sec. 1.30. - LI limited industrial district. 
A.  Purpose: 
1.  Industrial development represents a substantial part of the economic base at Pharr, and more is desired. The rapidly changing variety of industry found in Pharr and the development of modern technology make it appropriate and desirable to provide for standards of industrial performance rather than to attempt to categorize by name. The purpose of this district is to create a limited industrial zone that provides for the modern type of industrial uses or industrial park. With the exception of hazardous materials manufacture, this zone allows the same uses as the HI, heavy industrial district. Limitations are placed on the uses in this district to significantly restrict the outside activities and storage of materials, noise, vibration, smoke, pollution, fire and explosive hazard, glare and any other potentially blighting influences. These limitations create a zone that could be considered the "highest and cleanest" industrial zone. 
2.  This zone is intended for industrial parks and larger, cleaner types of industries. The manufacturing uses should be conducted within a totally enclosed building. Any activities conducted outside should be screened and buffered, and no external effects such as excessive noise or odor should extend beyond the property lines. The sites for such uses are typically a minimum of two acres and average five to ten acres, with a significant amount of land dedicated to landscaping. 
3.  Because this is a limited industrial zone with substantial screening and buffering requirements, limited industrial uses are suitable for high-visibility locations such as along the freeway, or within a reasonable distance of residential areas. Residential uses should be discouraged from locating within the industrial district to protect the industries from residential complaints. 
4.  Areas should not be zoned to this usage unless they are located on or close to arterials capable of carrying commercial and truck traffic. They should be located close to major truck routes. Internal streets in such developments should be sized and strengthened to accommodate truck traffic. Each industry should work with the city to make sure the water pressure and capacity is adequate to provide fire protection for that particular industry before such industry is developed. Industries should also be required to prove that the water, wastewater, and drainage capacity is adequate before they are allowed to develop. 
B.  Permitted uses: 
1.  Any of the following uses when the manufacturing, compounding, or processing of previously prepared materials are conducted wholly within a completely enclosed building. That portion of the land used for open storage facilities for materials or equipment used in the manufacturing, compounding or processing or for truck loading and unloading shall be totally obscured by a wall on those sides abutting a residentially zoned district, or an OP, NC, or C-2 district. 
a.  The manufacturing, compounding, processing, packaging or treatment of such products as bakery goods, candy, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, toiletries, food products, hardware and cutlery; 
b.  The manufacturing, compounding, assembling or treatment of articles or merchandise from the following previously prepared materials: bone, canvas, cellophane, cloth, cork, feathers, felt, fiber, fur, glass, hair, horn, leather, paper, plastics, precious or semiprecious metals or stones, sheetmetal (excluding saw and planning mills) and yarns; 
c.  The manufacture of pottery and figurines or other similar ceramic products using only previously pulverized clay, and kilns fired only by electricity or gas; 
d.  Manufacture of musical instruments, toys, novelties, and metal or rubber stamps, or other small molded rubber products; 
e.  Manufacture or assembly of electrical appliances, electronic instruments and devices, radios, and phonographs; 
f.  Laboratories-Experimental, film or testing; 
g.  Manufacture and repair of electric or neon signs, sheetmetal products, including heating and ventilating equipment, cornices, eaves and the like; 
h.  Tool, dye, gauge and machine shops; 
i.  All public utilities, including buildings, necessary structures, storage yards and other related uses; 
j.  Any retail business, personal services, professional services, or business services; 
k.  Office buildings and accessory uses; 
l.  Restaurants and drive-in businesses; 
m.  Gasoline service stations, or retail outlets, where gasoline products are sold; 
n.  Automotive and other repair services, excluding wrecking yards; 
o.  Warehousing and storage; 
p.  Any wholesale trades conducted in an enclosed building; 
q.  Agricultural uses unplatted land in accordance with all other ordinances; 
r.  Other uses of a similar and no more objectionable character to those principal uses permitted subject to any and all provisions of ordinance relating to the use of property within the City of Pharr. 
2.  Accessory structures and uses customarily related to the above principal uses authorized in this district, including the residence for a night watchman or caretaker employed on the premises. 
3.  Amusement parks, circus or carnival grounds, commercial amusements or recreational developments or tents or other temporary structures used for meetings, in accordance with all other applicable ordinances, and located more than 300 feet from the nearest residentially zoned land. 
C.  Conditional uses (require use permits, see article III): 
1.  A portable building used for a night watchman which is not larger than 200 square feet. 
2.  Commercial uses that involve outside storage of materials and equipment and/or outside operations and/or with business hours between the hours of 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 
D.  Prohibited uses:

Some screening is required, but because of the potential for hazardous or possibly blighting uses, this district should not be located close to residential areas of any type. Residential uses should not be allowed within the district for the same reasons. 
3.  Areas should not be zoned to this usage unless they are located on or close to arterials capable of carrying commercial and truck traffic. They should be located close to major truck routes. Internal streets in such developments should be sized and strengthened to accommodate truck traffic. Each industry should work with the city to make sure the water pressure and capacity is adequate to provide fire protection for that particular industry before such industry is developed.

Sec. 1.35. - PUD planned unit development district. 
A.  Purpose: In certain instances the purposes of the zoning ordinance may be achieved by the development of planned units which do not conform in all respects with the land use pattern designated on the zoning map or the district regulations prescribed by this ordinance or the subdivision ordinance. A planned unit development (PUD) may include a combination of different dwelling types and/or a variety of land uses which creatively complement each other and harmonize with existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity. The purpose of the district is to encourage creative development of the land, provide locations for well-planned comprehensive developments, and provide for variety and flexibility in the development patterns of the city which conform with the purposes of the general plan. The planning and zoning commission is empowered to grant permits for planned unit developments subject to review and approval by the governing body. 
B.  Permitted uses: The following uses are permitted as part of an approved planned unit development:

9.  Medical centers or hospitals. 
10.  Any combination of uses that are compatible with one another. 
11.  Other such uses that lend themselves to planning concepts that may not be allowed in other zoning districts. 
12.  For purposes of this ordinance, land use designations in a planned unit development will reflect a specific zone classification in determining allowed uses. Other uses may be considered by the planning and zoning commission and the city commission at the time the ordinance is approved if the additional uses are shown to be compatible to other uses in the development and the surrounding land uses. 
C.  Prohibited uses: 
1.  Any building erected or land used for other than the use shown on the planned unit development plan, as approved by the planning and zoning commission, and as recorded with the director of planning and chief building inspector. 
2.  Any use of property that does not meet the required minimum lot size; front, side and rear yard dimension; and/or lot width, or exceeds the maximum height, building coverage or density per gross acre as shown in the recorded development plan, and approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
3.  Any use deemed by the planning and zoning commission and/or city commission as being detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the citizens of Pharr.

1.  Minimum size of a residential planned unit development, five acres. 
2.  Minimum size of a commercial and/or industrial planned unit development, five acres. 
3.  Minimum size of a planned unit development combining residential, commercial or industrial uses, five acres. 
4.  Development standards and area requirements for each use shall meet or exceed the maximum and minimum standards applicable to such uses as if those uses were situated in the least restrictive districts in which such uses are permitted. 
5.  Modification of these development standards shall be considered by the planning and zoning commission and the city commission under the following circumstances: 
a.  The proposed modifications substantially meet the intent of the zoning and subdivision ordinances and the comprehensive plan. 
b.  The proposed modification provides for better project design. 
c.  The combination of different dwelling types and/or the variety of land uses in the development will complement each other and will harmonize with existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity. 
d.  The development will not generate more traffic than the streets in the vicinity can carry without congestion and the development will not overload utilities. 
e.  Financial reasons will not be the sole reason for modification of standards. 
6.  In approving the planned unit development ordinance and concept and/or development plan, the city commission shall, after recommendations by the planning and zoning commission, specify such land uses, maximum height, floor area ratios, density, minimum off-street parking and loading standards, setbacks, site coverage, minimum off-street parking and loading standards, setbacks, site coverage, building spacing, access, screening walls or landscaping, building area, open space, pedestrian ways, public or private streets, alleys, and other development and protective requirements considered necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare, and to create a reasonable transition to and protection from property adjacent to a planned unit development district. Such standards shall be specified in the ordinance establishing the district, and in the concept and the development plan. 
E.  Application process: An application for a planned unit development district shall be made to the planning and zoning commission in the same manner that an application for a zone change is made.

    The purpose of the regulations described by this article is to allow the compatible and orderly development, within the city, of uses which may be suitable only in certain locations in a zoning district if developed in a specific way or only for a limited period of time. 
Sec. 1.41. - Permit required. 
    A use permit is required for all conditional uses as set forth in the conditional use paragraph of each use district. At no time may a structure or property be adapted to a conditional use without first obtaining a use permit. The conditional use permit is issued to the property owner, or to an individual with written permission from the owner authorizing such individual to use such property for the purpose for which the conditional use permit is being requested, and is not transferable. Any addition to or change in a structure which constitutes a percentage of the structure greater than set out in section 1.79.C.3 herein, and any change in location, change in ownership or business entity owning or carrying out its operation on the property terminates the conditional use permit.

C.  If any request is made by the establishment selling or distributing alcoholic beverages to alter, revise or amend any conditions or requirements under which such establishment has operated under the prior permit, such request shall constitute a request for a new conditional use permit and must follow all the procedures established for a new request. 
D.  If a permittee who has previously held a permit for an establishment selling or distributing alcoholic beverages for a minimum of two years and the permit has lapsed wishes to reapply for a permit for the same location as the permit was previously held, and there have been no negative incidents or reports to the Pharr police department or Texas alcoholic beverage commission during such two-year period, the city commission may authorize a 60-day provisional permit during which period the applicant may reapply for a conditional use permit. 
The applicant must meet all requirements for a conditional use permit within the next 60 days in order to maintain the permit but upon approval of the 60-day provisional permit by the city commission, the city secretary is authorized to execute the application with a limitation of "60 days only" upon such application.

Sec. 1.79. - General. 
    The general public, the city commission, and the planning and zoning commission are directed to take note that nonconformities in the use and development of land and buildings are to be avoided, or eliminated where now existing, wherever and whenever possible, except: 
(1)  When necessary to preserve property rights established prior to the date these regulations became effective or any future amendments to these regulations become effective as to the property in question, and 
(2)  When necessary to promote the general welfare and to protect the character of the surrounding property. 
Except as hereinafter specified, any use, building or structure lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of this ordinance may be continued, even though such use, building or structure may not conform with the provisions of this ordinance for the district in which it is located. In addition, any use, building or structure lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of any amendment to this ordinance may be continued, even though such use, building or structure may not conform with the provisions of said amendment to this ordinance for the district in which it is located. 
A.  Nonconforming uses continued or changed: 
[1.]  The right to continue such nonconforming uses shall be subject to regulations prohibiting the creation of a nuisance and regulations reasonably protecting adjacent property. 
[2.]  If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of a more restrictive classification, or to a conforming use, provided that such use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use of less restrictive classification. 
B.  Conditional uses: Any use existing on the effective date of this ordinance which is listed as a conditional use in the district where it is located shall be and shall remain a nonconforming use until a conditional use permit is obtained as provided in this ordinance. If such use is discontinued or abandoned for 30 consecutive days or for 180 days during any three-year period, the use shall meet the requirements of this ordinance and shall obtain a use permit before it is continued. 
C.  Alteration of nonconforming uses: No existing building or premises devoted to a use that is not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which such building or premises is located shall be enlarged or altered in a way which quantitatively increases its nonconformity, except when required to do so by law or order, unless the use thereof is changed to a use that is permitted in the district in which such building or premises is located, and except as follows: 
1.  When authorized by the board of adjustment in accordance with the provisions of article XII, the substitution for a nonconforming use of another nonconforming use, or an extension of a nonconforming use, may be made. 
2.  Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use. 
3.  When authorized by the board of adjustment in accordance with the provisions of article XII, enlargement or completion of a building devoted to a nonconforming use may be made upon the lot occupied by such building, where such extension is necessary and incidental to the existing use of such building and does not exceed 25 percent of its area of nonconformity. 
4.  When authorized by the board of adjustment in accordance with the provisions of article XII, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout those parts of a building which were manifestly designed or arranged for such use prior to the date on which such use of said building became nonconforming, if no structural alterations, except those required by law, are made therein. 
5.  The provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to prevent the extension of any building existing in any district at the time of the adoption of this ordinance, to the height to which the walls, foundation and framework of such existing building originally were intended, designed and constructed to carry; provided, however, that the actual construction of the extensions in height permitted by this paragraph shall have been duly commenced within two years from the date of the adoption of this ordinance. 
D.  Cessation of use of building or land: For the purposes of the succeeding subsections, a use shall be deemed to have ceased when it has been discontinued for 60 consecutive days or for six months during any three-year period whether with the intent to abandon said use or not.

If, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance and Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 1011e [V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.006], as amended, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be entered on the official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the board of commissioners [city commission].

Regardless of the existence of copies of the official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map, which shall be located in the office of the director of planning, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the city. 
5.  In the event that the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature and/or number of changes and additions, the board of commissioners [city commission] may, by resolution, adopt a new official zoning map, which shall supersede the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk, and bearing the seal of the city and date under the following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces Ordinance No. 74-76 of the City of Pharr, Texas."

6.  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsection (a) [B.1] through (e) [B.5] above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map.

8.  When streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or alleys as shown on the zoning district map, the zoning administrator may apply the district designations on the map to the streets or alleys on the ground in such a manner as to conform to the intent and purpose of this ordinance. 
9.  Whenever any street or alley is vacated, the particular district in which the adjacent property lies shall be automatically extended to the centerline of any such street or alley.

Alternate members shall serve in the absence of one or more of the regular members when requested to do so by the chairman or his authorized representative. All cases to be heard and ruled upon will always be heard by a minimum of four members and a maximum of seven. 
(D)  An individual board member may not act in an official capacity except through the action of the board. When a member is called upon to voice opinions at public or private functions, he/she shall indicate that he/she is speaking for himself/herself and not representing the board or the city unless a formal action by the planning and zoning commission or board of commissioners has been taken on the specific issue. 
(E)  A board member who is absent for three consecutive regular meetings or half of all regular meetings in a "rolling" twelve-month timeframe automatically vacates the member's position. This does not apply to an absence due to illness or injury of the board member, an illness or injury of a board member's immediate family member, or the birth or adoption of the board member's child for 90 days after the event. The board member must notify the director of development services of the reason for the absence not later than the date of the next regular meeting of the board. Failure to notify before the next regular meeting of the board will result in an unexcused absence. 
(F)  At each meeting, each board member shall sign an attendance sheet which indicates that the member does not have a conflict of interest with any item on that agenda, or identifies each agenda item on which the member has a conflict of interest. Failure to sign the sheet results in the member being counted as absent and his/her votes are not counted. 
(G)  A board member who seeks to resign from the board shall submit a written resignation to the chairman. If possible, the resignation should allow for a thirty-day notice so the board of commissioners can appoint a replacement. 
(H)  All board members must be a resident of the city. 
(I)  The director of development services and the assistant city manager shall be ex officio members of the planning and zoning commission without a right to vote but will provide technical support and expertise to the commission. The provisions of subsection (E), above, do not apply to ex officio members. 
(J)  Board members serve without compensation. The board and its members have no authority to expend funds or to incur or make an obligation on behalf of the city unless authorize and approved by the board of commissioners. Board members may be reimbursed for expenses authorized and approved by the board of commissioners. 
(K)  Members will comply with city ordinances, rules and policies applicable to the board and its members, including but not limited to ethics, courtesy and respect. Members are prohibited from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the city, bears a negative impact on public perception of the city, its employees or elected and appointed officials. 
(L)  Members shall not have any administrative or enforcement authority in the day to day operations of the city. They shall have no authority or right to enforce any rule, ordinance or regulation of the city. Any violations are violation of this ordinance. 
Sec. 189.4 Article 4. Officers. 
(A)  The officers of the board shall consist of a chairman and a vice-chairman, secretary and parliamentarian. 
(B)  The chairman is recommended by the mayor and the city council shall approve the recommendation by a vote of the majority of the board of commissioners during the annual appointment process. Should the mayor fail to recommend a chairman for each board, committee or commission, and/or the board of commissioners fails to approve any chairman recommended by the mayor, a majority of the board of commissioners plus one (super-majority) may approve appointment of a chairman. The other officers (except for parliamentarian) shall be elected annually by a majority vote of the commission at the first regular meeting in January. In the event a current officer becomes ineligible to serve as an officer, the commission may hold an emergency election as needed for all officers. 
(C)  The term of office shall be one year, beginning January and ending December. An officer may continue to serve until a successor is elected. A person may not serve as an officer in a designated position of a commission for more than three consecutive one-year terms.

(D)  The director of development services will serve at the parliamentarian for the board and in the absence of the director the assistant city manager shall serve in that capacity. 
(E)  A member may not hold more than one office at a time.

(B)  Staff shall assemble all regular meeting items as directed by city ordinance and internal city policy. 
(C)  Posting of the agenda must comply with Texas Government Code Chapter 551 (Texas Open Meetings Act). 
Sec. 189.7 Article 7. Meetings. 
(A)  The board meetings shall comply with Texas Government Code Chapter 551 (Texas Open Meetings Act). 
(B)  Board meetings shall be governed by Robert's Rules of Order. 
(C)  All meetings of the board shall be open to the public. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member on each questions, or if absent or failing to vote. The director of development services shall be custodian and possessor of records and minutes of the meetings. 
(D)  The board shall meet at least twice a month. In November of each year, the board shall adopt a schedule of the meetings for the upcoming year, as composed by staff. 
(E)  Special meetings may be called by the chairman or at the requested by three or more members. The call shall state the purpose of the meeting, the time and the date. A board may not call a meeting in addition to its regular scheduled meetings as identified in its adopted meeting schedule, more often than once a quarter, unless the meeting is required to comply with a statutory deadline or a deadline established by council. 
(F)  Four members constitute a quorum. A quorum is required for the board to convene a meeting and to conduct business at a meeting. 
(G)  If a quorum for a meeting does not convene within one-half hour of the posted time for the meeting, then the meeting may not be held. 
(H)  An affirmative vote of at least 4 members must be made to approve any motion. 
(I)  The chairman has the same voting privilege as any other member. 
(J)  The board shall allow citizens to address the board on agenda items and during a period of time set aside for citizen communications. The chairman may limit a speaker to three minutes. In the interest of fairness to the applicants and appellants appearing before the board and those appearing in opposition to the same, no discussion shall be held by a member or members of this board with the applicant, appellant, or opposition, who is attempting to influence any board member concerning the application or other matter involving an applicant or appellant before the board either at home or office, or in person, by telephone, letter or electronic communication. All such discussions shall be held during a meeting at which the item is posted for discussion so that all members shall have the full benefit of such a discussion. 
(K)  The development services staff shall prepare the board minutes. The minutes of each board meeting must include the vote of each member on each item before the board and indicate whether a member is absent or failed to vote on an item. 
(L)  The city clerk shall retain agendas, approved minutes, internal review reports and bylaws. The department of development services shall retain all other board documents. The documents are public records under Texas Local Government Code Chapter 552 (Texas Public Information Act). 
(M)  Each person and board member attending a board meeting should observe proper decorum. 
(N)  Debate and motions. Motions are usually classified in several ways: 
(1)  Main motion; 
(2)  Subsidiary motion/un-debatable motions; 
(3)  Privileged motions; and 
(4)  Fully-debatable motions. 
    A main motion is a motion that brings business before the board. Main motions are made while no other motion is pending. Any of the subsidiary or privileged motions may be made while the main motion is pending, and in many cases these motions, if passed, will affect the board's consideration of the main motion. A subsidiary or un-debatable motion is a type of motion by which a deliberative assembly deals directly with a main motion prior to (or instead of) voting on the main motion itself. Subsidiary motions are motions such as to postpone indefinitely, amend and to table. 
    Subsidiary or un-debatable motions involve procedural questions that can be resolved without discussion, such as tabling a main motion, moving the previous question, restricting further discussion of a main motion to a fixed number of minutes, postponing action, or referring an item under discussion to a committee. After a subsidiary or un-debatable motion is offered, the chairman must immediately take a vote, without discussion. 
    Privileged motions grant precedence over ordinary business. Such motions have limited debate permitted. They include setting the time of the next meeting, adjourn, recess or executive session. Any discussion of a privileged motion must be addressed to the motion itself. A motion to fix the time for adjourning the commission meeting, for example, might require limited debate as to the advisability of such a decision, but other points of discussion would be out of order. 
    Fully-debatable motions are subject to unlimited discussion prior to a decision. 
    One of the most important principles of debate is that board member's statements be directly relevant to the item under consideration. Board members recognized by the chairman are given the floor only for the purpose of discussing the item then pending, and they are out of order if they depart from that item. "Debate" can easily evolve into statements of personal philosophy. Interesting though they may seem to the speaker, such departures do not belong in a commission meeting. 
Sec. 189.8 Article 8. Committees/working groups. 
    COMMITTEES 
(A)  The planning and zoning commission will have no committees. 
    WORKING GROUPS 
(A)  The board can determine the size of a working group but the number of board members serving on the working group must be less than a quorum of the board. 
(B)  A working group may designate a chair, with the member's consent, but is not required to do so. 
(C)  Quorum requirements do not apply to working groups. 
(D)  Staff support will not be provided for working groups. 
(E)  Working groups are not required to post their meetings in accordance with the Texas Government Code Chapter 551 (Texas Open Meetings Act). 
Sec. 189.9 Article 9. Parliamentary authority. 
    The rules contained in the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order shall govern the board in all cases to which they are applicable, except when inconsistent with these bylaws or with special rules of procedure which the board or city council may adopt. 
Sec. 189.10 Article 10. Amendment of bylaws. 
    A bylaw amendment is not effective unless approved by the board of commissioners of the city . 
(Ord. No. O-2016-05, 2-15-16) 
ARTICLE XII. - BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT 

Sec. 1.90. - Organization of board of adjustment. 
A.  A board of adjustment is hereby created in accordance with the provisions of Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 1011g [V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.008 et seq.]. The board of adjustment shall consist of five members who are residents and taxpayers of the city, each to be appointed by the mayor and approved by the board of commissioners [city commission] for two years and removable for cause by the appointing authority upon written charges and after public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member whose place becomes vacant for any cause, in the same manner as the original appointment was made. Provided, however, that the board of commissioners [city commission] may by Charter provision or ordinance provide for the appointment of two alternate members of the board who shall serve in the absence of one or more of the regular members when requested to do so by the mayor or city manager, as the case may be. All cases to be heard by the board of adjustment will always be heard by the minimum number of four members. These alternate members, when appointed, shall serve for the same period as the regular members, which is for a term of two years, and any vacancy shall be filled in the same manner and they shall be subject to removal the same as the regular members. 
B.  The director of planning or his authorized representative shall be an ex officio member of the zoning board of adjustment without power of vote and as an ex officio member of such board shall set up and maintain a separate file for each application for appeal, special exception and variance received and shall record therein the names and addresses of all persons, firms and corporations to whom notices are mailed, including the date of mailing and the person by whom such notices were delivered to the mailing clerk, post office or mailbox and further keep a record of all notices published as required herein. All records and files herein provided for shall be permanent and official files and records of the city. 
C.  Two members of the board must be members of the city planning and zoning commission, provided such appointment shall be for the term of office as commissioner only. 
D.  The secretary of the board shall forthwith notify in writing the board of commissioners [city commission], the commission and the city building inspector of each decision, interpretation, special exception and variance granted under the provisions of this ordinance. 
E.  The board of adjustment shall annually select one of its members to be the chairman, a vice-chairman to act in the absence of the chairman, and a secretary. 
Sec. 1.91. - Operational procedure. 
A.  General: 
1.  The board shall adopt rules to govern its proceedings, provided, however, that such rules are not inconsistent with this ordinance or state law. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairman, or in his absence, the vice-chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. 
2.  All meetings of the board shall be open to the public. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep record of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record. 
3.  Appeals to the board may be made by any person aggrieved, or by any municipal officer, department, or board affected by any decision of the director of planning. Such appeal shall be filed with the board by the director of planning within 15 days after the original decision. The appeal shall be accompanied by all papers constituting the record pertaining to such appeal. Formal notice of the appeal shall be issued by the director of planning, such notice to specify the grounds upon which the appeal is made. The board shall set a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal. 
4.  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certified [certifies] to the board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
5.  Fees: Upon notice of appeal being given to the director of planning and before such appeal shall be construed as having been perfected, the applicant must file with such notice of appeal to the board a fee. The board of adjustment, with the concurrence and approval of the board of commissioners [city commission], shall determine and set forth a fee schedule for the purpose of recovering the administrative cost of processing requests and appeals called for by this ordinance. Such fee shall be paid by the applicant and shall not be designed for restricting an applicant's ability to seek a hearing and/or to generate revenue for other than recovery of actual administrative cost incurred by the city. Immediately upon receipt of such application and fee, the director of planning shall note thereon the date of filing, and make a permanent record thereof. 
6.  No appeal to the board for the same or related variance on the same piece of property shall be allowed prior to the expiration of six months from a previous ruling by the board on any appeal to such body unless other property in the immediate vicinity has, within the said six-months' period, been changed or acted on by the board or board of commissioners [city commission] so as to alter the facts and conditions on which the previous board action was based. Such change of circumstances shall permit the rehearing of an appeal by the board prior to the expiration of six-months' period, but such conditions shall in no way have any force in law to compel the board, after a hearing, to grant a subsequent appeal. Such subsequent appeal shall be considered entirely on its merits and the peculiar and specific conditions related to the property on which the appeal is brought. 
7.  At a public hearing relative to any appeal, any interested party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to establish the necessary facts to warrant favorable action of the board on any appeal. Any special exception or variance granted or authorized by the board under the provisions of this ordinance shall authorize the issuance of a building permit or a certificate of occupancy, as the case may be, for a period of 90 days from the date of the favorable action of the board unless said board shall have in its action approved a longer period of time and has so shown such specific longer period in the minutes of its action. If the building permit and/or certificate of occupancy shall not have been applied for within said 90-day period or such extended period as the board may have specifically granted, then the special exception or variance shall be deemed to have been waived and all rights thereunder terminated. Such termination and waiver shall be without prejudice to a subsequent appeal and such subsequent appeal shall be subject to the same regulations and requirements for hearing as herein specified for the original appeal. 
B.  Actions of the board: 
1.  In exercising its powers, the board may, on [in] conformity with the provisions of the statutes of the State of Texas as existing or hereafter amended, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The board shall have the power to impose reasonable conditions to be complied with by the applicant. 
2.  The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance or to effect any variance in said ordinance. 
3.  Any person or persons, jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the board, or any taxpayer or officer, department or board of the municipality may present to a court of record (district court) a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within ten days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board and not thereafter. 
C.  Notice of hearing before the board required: 
1.  The board shall hold a public hearing on all appeals made to it and written notice of such public hearing shall be sent to the applicant, all persons who are owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the property on which the appeal is made, and all other persons deemed by the board to be affected thereby. 
2.  Such notice shall be given not less than 15 days before the date set for hearing to all such owners who have rendered their said property for city taxes as the ownership appears on the last city tax roll. Such notice may be served by deposition of the same, properly addressed and postage paid, in the U.S. post office. 
3.  Notice shall also be given by publishing the same in official publication of the city at least three times and at least 15 days prior to the date set for the hearing, which shall state the time and place of such hearing. 
D.  Jurisdiction of the board: 
1.  Exceptions and variances distinguished: 
a.  A special exception is a permission given by the board properly authorized by this ordinance in specific cases for an applicant to use his property in a manner contrary to the provisions of this ordinance provided such use subserves the general welfare and preserves the community interest. 
b.  A variance is an authorization by the board granting relief and doing substantial justice in the use of the applicant's property by a property owner where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship. 
2.  Special exceptions: 
a.  A special exception may be granted an applicant when the board finds: 
(1)  That the granting of such exception will not be injurious or otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the general public, and 
(2)  That the granting of such exception will not be detrimental or injurious to the property or improvements in such zone or neighborhood in which the property is located, and 
(3)  That the granting of such exception will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance. 
b.  In determining its finding, the board shall take into account the character and use of adjoining buildings and those in the vicinity, the number of persons residing or working in such building or upon such land, traffic conditions in the vicinity, and the conformance of such area to the zoning map and general plan. 
c.  The board may, after public hearing and subject to the conditions and safeguards herein contained, authorize special exceptions to this ordinance as follows: 
(1)  Permit the enlargement of a nonconforming use only when the enlargement will not prolong the life of the nonconforming use. A specific period of time for the return to conformity can be required. 
(2)  Permit the use of a lot or lots in any dwelling district adjacent to any other district, even if separated therefrom by an alley or by a street, for the parking of passenger cars under such safeguards and conditions of the more restricted property, provided no other business use is made of such lot or lots. 
(3)  Permit such modification of a yard, lot area or lot width regulation requirements as may be necessary to secure appropriate improvement of a parcel of land where such parcel was separately owned on the effective date of this ordinance, and is not adjacent to another parcel of the same ownership and where such parcel is of such size that it cannot be improved without such modification or of such restricted area that it cannot be appropriately improved without such modification. 
(4)  Grant conditional use permits in any zone where such uses are allowed conditionally by the provisions of this ordinance. 
(5)  Permit the modification of the requirements for signs. 
(6)  May grant a permit for the extension of a use, height, or area regulation into an adjoining district for a distance of not more than 25 feet, where the boundary line of the district divides a lot in single ownership as of the effective date of this ordinance. 
d.  In granting any special exception under the provisions of this ordinance, the board may designate such conditions in connection therewith which, in its opinion, will secure substantially the purpose and intent of this ordinance. 
3.  Variances: 
a.  A variance may be granted to an applicant when the board finds: 
(1)  That there are special circumstances or conditions applying to the land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or building and do not apply generally to lands or buildings in the same zone or neighborhood, and that said circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building; and 
(2)  That the granting of such variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such zone or neighborhood in which the property is located; and 
(3)  That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance as granted by the board is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose; and 
(4)  That the literal enforcement and strict application of the provisions of this ordinance will result in an unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the general provisions and intent of this ordinance and that in granting such variance the spirit of the ordinance will be preserved and substantial justice done; and 
(5)  In addition to considering the character and use of adjoining buildings and those in the vicinity, the board, in determining its findings, shall take into account the number of persons residing or working in such buildings or upon such land and traffic conditions in the vicinity. 
b.  The board may, after public notice and hearing and subject to the conditions and safeguards herein contained, vary or adapt the strict application of any of the terms of this ordinance under the power and authority herein granted and consistent with section 1.91, subsection D. 
c.  In granting any variance under the provisions of this ordinance, the board may designate such conditions in connection therewith which, in its opinion, will secure substantially the purpose and intent of this ordinance. 
d.  The board may permit the change of occupancy from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use when the extent of the second nonconforming use is found to be less detrimental to the environment than the first. 
e.  The board may permit the enlargement of a nonconforming use only when the enlargement will not prolong the life of the nonconforming use. A specific period of time for the return to conformity can be required. 
f.  The board may permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming structure or building on the lot or tract occupied by such building, provided such reconstruction does not, in the judgment of the board, prevent the return of such property to a conforming use or increase the nonconformity of a nonconforming structure. 
g.  The board may permit such variance of the front yard, side yard, rear yard, lot width, lot depth, coverage, minimum setback standards, off-street parking or off-street loading regulations where the literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would result in an unnecessary hardship, and where such variance is necessary to permit a specific parcel of land which differs from other parcels of land in the same district by being of such restricted area, shape or slope that it cannot be developed in a manner commensurate with the development permitted upon other parcels of land in the same district. A variation from the standard established by this ordinance shall not be granted to relieve a self-created or personal hardship, nor for financial reason only, nor shall such modification be granted to permit any person a privilege in developing a parcel of land not permitted by this ordinance to other parcels of land in the district. 
4.  The board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is error on any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the director of planning in the enforcement of this ordinance. 
5.  The board shall interpret the intent of the zoning district map where uncertainty exists because the physical features on the ground vary from those on the zoning districts map and none of the rules of this ordinance set forth in section 1.82 apply. 
E.  Appeals from the board of adjustment: 
1.  Any person or persons, or any board, taxpayer, department, board or bureau of the city aggrieved by any decision of the board may seek review by a court of record of such decision, in the manner provided by the laws of this state. 
2.  Upon presentation of such petition referred to in section 1.91, subsection B3, the court of record may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the board to review such decision of the board and shall prescribe therein the time within which a return thereto must be made and served upon the realtor's attorney, which shall not be less than ten days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay proceedings upon the decisions appealed from, but the court may, on application, on notice to the board and on due cause shown, grant a restraining order. 
3.  The board shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or such portions thereof as may be called for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified. 
4.  If, upon hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or appoint a reference to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court shall be made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review. 
5.  Costs shall not be allowed against the board unless it shall appear to the court that it acted with gross negligence, or in bad faith, or with malice in making the decision appealed from. 
6.  All issues in any proceedings under this section shall have preference over all other civil actions and proceedings.

4.  Of hearing appeals regarding recommendations on use permits from the planning and zoning commission. Note: On any conditional use permit application voted on by the board of commissioners and denied, reapplication will not be allowed until one year has elapsed from the date of the board's action. 
5.  The planning and zoning commission, with the concurrence and approval of the board of commissioners [city commission], shall determine and set forth a fee schedule for the purpose of recovering the administrative cost of processing requests and the public hearings called for by this section.
