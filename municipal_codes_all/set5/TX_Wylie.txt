PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Wylie, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1997 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1997 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines for ease of use by readers. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Supervising Legal Editor, and Francine King, Technical Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Carole Ehrlich, City Secretary, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Home Rule Charter, as approved by the voters of Wylie on January 19, 1985. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
The Home Rule Charter committee was established by Ordinance No. 84-42 adopted on September 11, 1984. Ordinance No. 85-1 adopted on January 9, 1985, declared that the city had more than 5,000 inhabitants. Following the Charter election on January 19, 1985, Ordinance No. 85-3 adopted on January 21, 1985, canvassed the election returns and declared the results. The Charter election results were 102 for adoption of the Charter and 70 against adoption.

Editor's note- The city asserts, pertaining to Section 6.C, that only the text in the initial sentence of that subsection is now appropriate and relevant pertaining to the filling of vacancies, and that the remainder of Sec. 6.C should have been (but was not) struck through as a proposed deletion in Proposition 2 as presented to voters on May 2, 1998. 
Section 7. - Powers of the City Council. 
    All powers of the city shall be vested in the city council, except as otherwise provided by law or this Charter. The city council shall provide for the exercise thereof and the performance of all duties and obligations imposed upon the city by law.

Except where authorized by law, no mayor or councilman shall hold any other city office or city employment during his term as mayor or councilman, and no former mayor or councilman shall hold any compensated appointive city office or city employment until one year after the expiration of his term as mayor or councilman. 
B.  Appointments and Removals. Neither the city council nor any of its members shall in any manner dictate the appointment or removal of any city administrative officers or employees whom the city manager or any of his subordinates are empowered to appoint, but the city council, at a meeting called for that purpose, may express its views and fully and freely discuss with the city manager anything pertaining to appointment and removal of such officers and employees. 
C.  Interference With Administration.

D.  Reading. The reading aloud of a title and caption of the ordinance shall suffice as a reading. If two councilmen request that the ordinance be read in its entirety, it must be so read. 
Section 14. - Authentication, Recording, Codification, Printing, and Distribution. 
A.  Authentication and Recording. The city secretary shall record in a properly indexed book kept for that purpose, all ordinances and resolutions adopted by the city council, and it shall be kept open for public inspection.

B.  Codification. Within three years after adoption of this Charter, and at least every five years thereafter, the city council shall provide for the preparation of the codification of all general ordinances of the city. Every general ordinance enacted subsequent to such codification shall be enacted as an amendment to the code. For the purposes of this section, general ordinances shall be deemed to be those ordinances of a permanent or continuing nature which affect the residents of the city at large. The codification shall be published promptly, together with this Charter and any amendments thereto, and with appropriate references to state statutes and constitution, and such codes of technical regulations and other rules and regulations as the city council may specify. This compilation shall be known and cited officially as the Wylie City Code and shall be in full force and effect without the necessity of such code or any part thereof being published in any newspaper. The caption, descriptive clause, and other formal parts of the ordinances of the city may be omitted without affecting the validity of such ordinances when they are published as a code. 
C.  Printing of Ordinances and Resolutions. The city council shall cause each ordinance and each amendment to this Charter to be printed promptly following its adoption, and the printed ordinances and Charter amendments shall be distributed free or sold to the public at reasonable prices to be fixed by the city council. A copy of each ordinance and resolution may be placed in city offices. 
Section 15. - Investigations by the City Council. 
    The city council shall have the power to inquire into the official conduct of any department, agency, office, officer, or employee of the city, and for that purpose shall have the power to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, and compel the production of books, papers, and other evidence material to the inquiry. The city council shall provide, by ordinance, penalties for contempt for failing or refusing to obey any such subpoena or to produce any such books, papers or other evidence, and shall have the power to punish any such contempt in the manner provided by such ordinance. 
Section 16. - Bond.

C.  Revenue Bonds. The city shall have the power to borrow money for the purpose of constructing, purchasing, improving, extending or repairing of public utilities, recreational facilities or any other self-liquidating municipal function not prohibited by the constitution and laws of the State of Texas, and to issue revenue bonds to evidence the obligation created thereby. Such shall be a charge upon and payable from the properties, or interest therein pledged, or the income therefrom, or both. The holders of the revenue bonds shall never have the right to demand payment thereof out of monies raised or to be raised by taxation. All such bonds shall be issued in conformity with the laws of the State of Texas and shall be used only for the purpose for which they were issued. 
D.  Certificates of Obligation. The city shall have the power to issue certificates of obligation in conformity with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 271, as the same now exists or is hereafter amended. Provided, however, that the published notice of intention to issue certificates, as provided for in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 271 shall, in addition to language required by V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 271.49, also contain the following statement: 
    The proposed certificates of obligation will be issued without further notice and without approval of the voters of the city unless a sufficient petition, signed by at least [five percent] of the qualified voters of the city, protesting the issuance of the certificates of obligation is filed with the city secretary, within 30 days from the first publication of this notice, prior to consideration of this matter by the Wylie City Council at the above time and date. In the event of the timely filing of a sufficient petition the city council may not authorize issuance of the certificates of obligations unless the issuance is first approved at an election.

If, at such election, a majority of the vote shall be in favor of creating such a debt or refunding outstanding valid bonds of the city, it shall be lawful for the city council to issue bonds as proposed in the ordinance submitting same but if a majority of the vote polled shall be against the creation of such debt or refunding such bonds, the city council shall be without authority to issue the bonds. In all cases when the city council shall order an election for the issuance of bonds of the city, it shall, at the same time, submit the question whether or not a tax shall be levied upon the property in the city for the purpose of paying the interest on the bonds and to create a sinking fund for their redemption.

Any authorization of payment or incurring of obligation in violation of the provisions of this Charter will be void and any payment so made illegal. Such action shall be the cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or made such payment or incurred such obligations, and he shall also be liable to the city for any amount so paid. However, this prohibition shall not be construed to prevent the making or authorizing of payments or making of contracts for capital improvements to be financed wholly or partly by the issuance of bonds, time warrants, certificates of indebtedness, or certificates of obligation, or to prevent the making of any contract or lease providing for payments beyond the end of the fiscal year, provided that such action is made or approved by ordinance.

Sec. 2-2. - Donation acceptance policy and procedures. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to establish procedures for the acceptance of donations to the City of Wylie and specific city departments. A uniform set of procedures shall be followed in acceptance of all solicited or unsolicited donations and proper approval shall be obtained prior to acceptance. All cash, equipment, in-kind services, materials and sponsorships donated to the City of Wylie or city departments shall be accounted for in accordance with the procedures set forth in this policy. 
(b)  Official acceptance. In order for donations of funds, equipment or in-kind services to be accepted, a formal review as outlined within this policy must be conducted. If it is determined that the donation is not in the best interest of the citizens of the City of Wylie, the donation shall be refused. 
(c)  Review prior to acceptance. The city manager or his/her designee shall review all donations for appropriateness and best use. Acceptance or refusal of donations shall be as determined by the city manager. The following are criteria which may be applied in determining if a donation is appropriate for acceptance: 
(1)  Is the use of the item or money for a designated purchase consistent with existing city policy, program outcomes and department/city goals? 
(2)  Do restrictions upon the use of the item or funds make it practical to accept? 
(3)  Do restrictions on disposal or retention of the item or funds make it practical to accept? 
(4)  Is required accounting for the item or funds excessively difficult? 
(5)  Would equipment require extensive repair or maintenance, and if so, is maintenance support available? 
(6)  Does use of equipment or materials require the purchase of additional items to be useful? 
(7)  Does acceptance of funds, equipment or in-kind services or materials present a conflict of interest for the city or its employees? Regardless of the value of the donation, if the donor is a contractor, potential contractor or there is reason to believe there may be a conflict of interest, then the city manager will determine if the gift should be accepted, rejected or submitted to council for approval. 
(8)  Will the donation result in an increase to the city's budget? Recipients must bear in mind that donations are to be considered one-time supplements to departments and should not be used to develop new programs or services which would require budget supplements from the city in the current or subsequent years. 
(d)  Approval. Donations with a value up to and including $5,000.00 may be approved by the city manager. Donations with a value that exceeds $5,000.00 must be approved by the city council. 
(e)  Specific use donations of funds. All donated funds which are given for a specific use shall be recorded in such a manner as to easily identify the intended use. Donations shall be receipted by the finance department, and a budget notation shall be prepared for all donations in excess of $5,000.00 specifying the intended revenue and expenditure account(s) to be increased. 
(f)  Memorials, donations in honor of individuals. Donations which are contingent upon recognition of an individual by plaque, sign, or other insignia on city property shall be accepted only after approval of the city council. The exception being those donations which fall under the criteria of the park memorial dedication policy approved by the city council on June 24, 2003 [included as section 78-2]. 
(g)  Donations of equipment. Donations of equipment will be considered based on program outcomes, department goals and needs. Each donation will be evaluated for usefulness and costs of potential replacement/rental rates will be considered. If there is any question as to the legal owner of the donated item, proof of ownership may be requested. 
(h)  Nonspecific use donations. Donors who wish to give a gift which is not specific to a given department may give a gift to the city in general. The city manager will determine if such gifts should go to a specific department or to a general city donation fund. Once determined, the donated money will be expended either for general purposes, or as a one-time supplement to a departmental operating budget. Approved donations shall be receipted by the finance department, and a budget notation shall be prepared for all donations in excess of $5,000.00 specifying the intended revenue and expenditure account(s) to be increased. 
(i)  Solicitations for community events. All solicitations on behalf of the City of Wylie, specific city departments, or which are distributed on the official letterhead of the city, shall be approved by the city manager prior to solicitation. In-kind contributions and sponsorships for specific events will be treated in the same way as donated funds. 
(j)  Solicitations for City of Wylie programs. Programs which will involve solicitations for program specific donations and/or in-kind donations (i.e. Reach For a Star) must receive prior approval from the city manager and may, after approval, establish separate program criteria. If determined necessary by the city manager, additional review of the proposed program may be required to evaluate potential risk and liability. 
(k)  Acknowledgement and receipt. A donation receipt form will be completed when donations are received, with the form completed by city staff. The donor shall retain a copy, the director shall be sent a copy and a copy will be sent to finance. The donor, not staff, must place a value on the gift.

(2)  Any current elected officials or board/commissions member or anyone seeking to become an elected officials or board/commissions member may submit a written request for a waiver of any provision of the code of ethics. The board of ethics is empowered to grant a waiver if it finds that the waiver will serve the best interests of the city. The board shall issue appropriate notice of its meeting on the waiver and its meeting shall be open to the public. The board shall either issue or deny the waiver within six weeks of receiving the request. 
(g)  Complaints or inquiries to the board of ethics . Any person may file an official written complaint or inquiry with the board of ethics asking whether a current elected officials or board/commissions member has failed to comply with this code of ethics. 
    Prior to review by the board of ethics, the city attorney shall first determine the following:

(h)  Procedures for complaints or inquiries . The city council shall adopt written rules to govern the board of ethics in order to create a process that is fair both to the person who submitted the complaint or inquiry and the person who is the subject of the complaint or inquiry. In addition to rules which the board may in its discretion adopt, the rules shall: 
(1)  Establish time lines for all aspects of its handling of complaints or inquiries. The time lines shall be sufficiently long to enable a person who is the subject of a complaint or inquiry to have adequate time to understand the complaint or inquiry and prepare a response. The rules shall allow the board to alter the time lines upon a request of the subject of a complaint or inquiry for more time to prepare; 
(2)  Require the complaint or inquiry to be in writing on a form approved by the board, to be signed, and to show the home or business address and telephone number of the person who submitted it. The form shall contain a statement that must be signed and which states that, to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable reflection, the information in the complaint or inquiry is true. The rules shall require the complaint or inquiry to describe the facts that constitute the violation of this code of ethics in sufficient detail so that the board and the person who is the subject of the complaint or inquiry can reasonably be expected to understand the nature of any offense that is being alleged; 
(3)  Prohibit the board from accepting complaints or inquiries about actions that took place or became known to the complainant more than six months prior to the date of filing; 
(4)  Require the board to notify the person who is the subject of the complaint or inquiry that a complaint or inquiry has been filed. The rules shall require the Board to provide the notification in a timely manner, but no more than five days from the day the complaint or inquiry was filed. The rules shall require the notification to include a copy of the full complaint or inquiry; a copy of any portion of this article that is alleged to have been or that may be violated; and the board's rules for dealing with complaints or inquiries; 
(5)  Require the board to provide the subject of the complaint or inquiry with a copy of the complaint or inquiry before it provides copies to any other parties. The rules shall recognize that distribution to the public of a complaint or inquiry prior to screening by the board as required in below could harm the reputation of an innocent person and is contrary to the public interest; therefore, the rules shall prohibit the public release of the complaint or inquiry until the screening process in below has been completed; 
(6)  Require the board or a committee of the board to meet within 31 days of receiving a complaint or inquiry to screen the complaint or inquiry. The rules shall allow the board to immediately dismiss a complaint or inquiry if: 
a.  The alleged violation is a minor or de minimis violation; 
b.  The complaint or inquiry is, on its face, frivolous, groundless, or brought for purposes of harassment; 
c.  The matter has become moot because the person who is the subject of the complaint or inquiry is no longer an elected officials or board/commissions member; 
d.  The person who is the subject of the complaint or inquiry had obtained a waiver or an advisory opinion under subsection (f) of this section permitting the conduct. 
The rules shall require the dismissal and the reason for dismissal to be in writing and available to the public. 
(7)  Require the board to have hearings at meetings, which are open to the public on complaints or inquiries, which have not been dismissed pursuant to subsection (g) of this section of this section or resolved under subsection (f). 
(8)  Allow any person who is the subject of a complaint or inquiry to designate a representative if he or she wishes to be represented by someone else, to present evidence, and to cross-examine witnesses. The rules shall allow the person who submitted the complaint or inquiry and the subject of the complaint or inquiry sufficient time to examine and respond to any evidence not presented to them in advance of the hearing; 
(9)  Require deliberations on complaints or inquiries to be conducted in open session; 
(10)  Allow the board to dismiss a complaint or inquiry without a finding for or against the subject of the complaint or inquiry if the person committed the violation due to oversight and comes into voluntary compliance; 
(11)  Allow the board to dismiss a complaint or inquiry if the person who submitted it does not appear at hearing and if, in the opinion of the board, it would be unfair to the subject of the complaint or inquiry not to have the opportunity to examine the person. The rules shall, however, require the board to schedule the hearing at a time that is reasonably convenient to both the person who submitted the complaint or inquiry and the subject of the complaint or inquiry; 
(12)  Require the board to base a finding of a violation upon [clear and convincing evidence]; 
(13)  Require the board to inform the person who submitted the complaint or inquiry and the subject of the complaint or inquiry in writing if it believes a complaint or inquiry is frivolous, groundless, or brought for purposes of harassment; 
(14)  Prohibit members who have not been present for the hearing from participating in a recommendation; 
(15)  Require that findings and recommendations be made only by a majority of the board; 
(16)  Allow the board to consider, when it makes findings and recommendations, the severity of offense; the presence or absence of any intention to conceal, deceive, or mislead; whether the violation was deliberate, negligent, or inadvertent; and whether the incident was isolated or part of a pattern; 
(17)  Allow the board to issue an advisory opinion in response to a complaint or inquiry, in lieu of making findings and recommendations, where deemed appropriate by the board.

If the unvaccinated animal is under four months of age at the time of the second vaccination, an additional booster shall be given when the animal reaches four months of age. If a veterinarian determines that a quarantined animal does not show the clinical signs of rabies, it may be released to the owner prior to or upon expiration of the quarantine period, provided the owner has paid all of the reasonable costs of such quarantine and any veterinarian bills. However, if the quarantined animal shows the clinical signs of the disease of rabies, the animal shall be humanely destroyed and its head or brain submitted to the nearest laboratory certified by the state department of health for rabies diagnosis for testing.

(b)  Any animal suspected of biting a person or animal shall be placed under a quarantine watch to determine if the animal is infected with rabies. This quarantine shall be for a period not less than ten days after the biting of such person or animal. The length of the quarantine shall be determined by the investigating animal control officer. 
(c)  The owner of the animal shall surrender the animal to the animal control officer immediately, or otherwise arrange for the animal control officer to pick up and retain such animal, in a separate kennel at the animal shelter for the period of the quarantine. After the animal has been released from quarantine, the owner may redeem the animal from the animal shelter by payment of the fees for quarantine, impoundment and medical and veterinary expenses prescribed in the fee schedule in appendix C of the Code.

(3)  The owner will observe the animal for any signs of illness or personality changes and report such changes to the animal control officer. 
(4)  The animal may not be moved from the known quarantine location without prior notification and approval of the animal control officer. 
(5)  The animal will remain under quarantine until the owner is notified that the final health inspection has been made and that the animal has been cleared by the animal control officer. Contact will be made by phone, personal service or certified mail. 
(6)  The animal may not receive a vaccination for rabies during the quarantine period. 
(7)  Failure to comply with all conditions of residence quarantine will result in the animal being impounded at the animal shelter for the duration of the quarantine period. 
(8)  Persons wishing to use the optional home quarantine shall be required to sign an agreement and pay the required fees attached thereto. The remains of any animal which expires during a home quarantine shall be delivered to the animal control center. Failure to deliver such remains shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
(e)  After the animal has been released from quarantine, the owner will have five days in which to have the animal registered with the city by the purchase of a city registration tag. 
(f)  It shall be unlawful for any person to interfere with the enforcement of this section or to fail to refuse to surrender to an animal control officer or other member of the environmental health department any animal involved or suspected of being involved in a bite case, or to otherwise fail or refuse to provide for the quarantining of animals as may be authorized by this chapter.

(Ord. No. 2008-49, § 3, 11-11-2008) 
Sec. 22-31. - Notice of proceedings. 
(a)  Notice of all proceedings before the board shall be given by the building official pursuant to the requirements set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 214, subch. A, when applicable. The building official shall also provide notice of all proceedings by: 
(1)  Sending written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested and by regular mail to all owners of the affected property as listed in the latest deed records; and 
(2)  Sending written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested and by regular mail to each lienholder for the affected property, as shown by the records in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the affected property is located, if the address of the lienholder can be ascertained from the deed of trust establishing the lien or other applicable instruments on file in the office of the county clerk; and 
(3)  Sending written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested and by regular mail to the party who filed an appeal with the board, if applicable; and 
(4)  Posting a copy of the notice on the front door of the building or structure situated on the affected property or as close to the front door as practicable. 
(b)  Notices shall be mailed and posted before the tenth day before the date of the hearing before the board and must state the date, time, subject, and place of the hearing. In addition, the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least once before the tenth day before the date of the hearing. 
(c)  If the address of a person having an interest in the property as shown in the deed records is unknown or if the notice is returned undelivered, a copy of such notice posted on the building or structure shall constitute notice to any person having an interest in the property who does not receive personal service. 
(Ord. No. 2008-49, § 3, 11-11-2008) 
Sec. 22-32. - Procedures to follow when order issued. 
    After the decision becomes final, a copy of the order issued by the board shall be promptly mailed first class, certified, return receipt requested to all persons to whom notice is required to be sent under section 22-30 hereof. In addition, a copy of the order shall be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city within ten calendar days after the date of mailing the copy as provided in this section. Also, a copy of the order shall be filed in the office of the city secretary and in the deed records of the county in which the land is located. 
(Ord. No. 2008-49, § 3, 11-11-2008) 
Sec. 22-33. - Appeals from board orders. 
    A decision of the board is the final administrative remedies and is binding upon all parties. Upon the filing of a decision with the city secretary and the building official, it is the duty of the building official to enforce the decision of the board. A person aggrieved by a decision of the board may within 30 days after receiving notice of the board's decision, appeal to a district court of the appropriate jurisdiction. The suit must be filed against the board as defendant and service of process must be made upon the board by serving the city secretary. If no suit is filed within the 30 days, the decision of the board shall be final and binding. With respect to orders issued hereunder pursuant to authority granted in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 54, subch. C, as hereafter amended, if appeals are not taken within the period prescribed under ch. 54, the decision of the board shall be, in all things, final and binding. 
(Ord. No. 2008-49, § 3, 11-11-2008) 
Sec. 22-34. - Failure to comply with order of board. 
    Failure to comply with an order issued by the board shall entitle the city to avail itself of any and all remedies provided by law, including but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  In the enforcement of the board's order, to vacate, secure, remove, repair or demolish a building or relocate the occupants at its expense and assess the expenses as a lien upon the real property on which the building or structure is located; 
(2)  In the enforcement of the board's order, to remedy at its expense conditions caused by accumulations of refuse, vegetation or other matter creating breeding and living places for insects and rodents and assess the expenses as a lien upon the real property on which the condition existed; 
(3)  To proceed under the jurisdiction of the municipal court of the city; provided, however, that this remedy shall not be construed to require an order from the board before the city may proceed under the jurisdiction of the municipal court; 
(4)  To enforce a civil penalty by filing a certified copy of the order with the district clerk of the appropriate county; and 
(5)  To proceed, in appropriate cases, in district or county court to enforce the city ordinances and orders of the board.

--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-32 , §§ 2, 3(Exh. A), adopted Dec. 12, 2017, repealed and re-enacted Art. III to read as set out herein. Former Art. III, §§ 22-41, 22-42, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2013-08, §§ 2-4, adopted Feb. 26, 2013. 

Sec. 22-41. - Adoption of the International Building Code. 
    The International Building Code, copyrighted by the International Code Council, Inc., save and except the amendments set forth in Exhibit "A", attached hereto and incorporated herein for all purposes, is hereby adopted as the Building Code for Wylie, prescribing regulations applicable to all commercial or nonresidential residential and existing premises structures and constitutes minimum requirements and standards for commercial or nonresidential residential and existing premises construction applications (the "2015 International Building Code"). The 2015 International Building Code is made a part of this Ordinance as if fully set forth herein. One (1) copy of the 2015 International Building Code is on file in the office of the City Secretary of Wylie being marked and designated as the 2015 International Building Code. 
(Ord. No. 2017-32 , §§ 2, 3, 12-12-2017) 
Sec. 22-42. - Amendments to the International Building Code. 
    [The following sections, paragraphs, and sentences of the 2015 International Building Code are hereby amended as follows:] 
Section 101.4; change to read as follows: 
101.4 Referenced codes. The other codes listed in Sections 101.4.1 through 101.4.8 and referenced elsewhere in this code, when specifically adopted, shall be considered part of the requirements of this code to the prescribed extent of each such reference. Whenever amendments have been adopted to the referenced codes and standards, each reference to said code and standard shall be considered to reference the amendments as well. Any reference to NFPA 70 or the Electrical Code shall mean the Electrical Code as adopted. 
(Reason: Legal wording to recognize locally adopted codes and amendments adopted with referenced codes. The former ICC Electrical Code is now Appendix K of this code but no longer called by that name.) 
Section 101.4.8; add the following: 
101.4.8 Electrical. The provisions of the Electrical Code shall apply to the installation of electrical systems, including alterations, repairs, replacement, equipment, appliances, fixtures, fittings and appurtenances thereto. 
(Reason: This was dropped when ICC quit publishing the ICC Electrical Code, but the Electrical Code still should be referenced regardless of how it is adopted.) 
Section 103 and 103.1 amend to insert the Department Name 
103.1 Creation of enforcement agency. The City of Wylie Building Inspection Division is hereby created and the official in charge thereof shall be known as the Building Official. 
(Reason: Reminder to be sure ordinance reads the same as designated by the city.) 
Section 105.2 Work exempt from permit; under sub-title entitled "Building" delete items 1, 2, 10 and 11. 
(Reason: Item deleted is for one- and two-family dwellings regulated by the International Residential Code. Accessory structures, fences and shade cloth structures would require a permit for commercial properties to ensure compliance with local ordinance, egress, accessibility, flame spread of fabric, wind/snow design load, etc.). 
Section 109; add Section 109.7 to read as follows: 
109.7 Re-inspection Fee. A fee as established by city council resolution may be charged when: 
1.  The inspection called for is not ready when the inspector arrives; 
2.  No building address or permit card is clearly posted; 
3.  City approved plans are not on the job site available to the inspector; 
4.  The building is locked or work otherwise not available for inspection when called; 
5.  The job site is red-tagged twice for the same item; 
6.  The original red tag has been removed from the job site. 
7.  Failure to maintain erosion control, trash control or tree protection. 
Any re-inspection fees assessed shall be paid before any more inspections are made on that job site. 
(Reason: This fee is not a fine or penalty but is designed to compensate for time and trips when inspections are called for when not ready.) 
Section 109; add Section 109.8, 109.8.1, 109.8.2 and 109.9 to read as follows: 
109.8 Work without a permit. 
109.8.1 Investigation. Whenever work for which a permit is required by this code has been commenced without first obtaining a permit, a special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work. 
109.8.2 Fee. An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected whether or not a permit is subsequently issued. The investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the permit fee required by this code or the city fee schedule as applicable. The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt the applicant from compliance with all other provisions of either this code or the technical codes nor from penalty prescribed by law. 
109.9 Unauthorized cover up fee. Any work concealed without first obtaining the required inspection in violation of Section 110 shall be assessed a fee as established by the city fee schedule. 
(Reason: This fee is not a fine or penalty but is designed to compensate for time and to remove incentive to attempt to evade permits and code compliance. Text taken from former Uniform Administrative Code.) 
Section 110.3.5; Lath, gypsum board and gypsum panel product inspection. Delete exception. 
(Reason: Lath or gypsum board inspections are performed in this area.) 
Section 202; amend definition of Ambulatory Care Facility as follows: 
AMBULATORY CARE FACILITY. Buildings or portions thereof used to provide medical, surgical, psychiatric, nursing or similar care on a less than 24-hour basis to individuals who are rendered incapable of self-preservation by the services provided. This group may include but not be limited to the following: 
- Dialysis centers 
- Sedation dentistry 
- Surgery centers 
- Colonic centers 
- Psychiatric centers 
(Reason: To clarify the range of uses included in the definition. [Explanatory note related to Ambulatory Care Facilities: This group of uses includes medical or dental offices where persons are put under for dental surgery or other services. Section 903.2.2 will now require such uses to be sprinklered if on other than the floor of exit discharge or if four or more persons are put under on the level of exit discharge. Recommend (1.) jurisdictions document any pre-existing non-conforming conditions prior to issuing a new C of O for a change of tenant and, (2.) On any medical or dental office specify on C of O the maximum number of persons permitted to be put under general anesthesia. 
It is recommended that before a Certificate of Occupancy is issued, a letter of intended use from the business owner shall be included and a C of O documenting the maximum number of care recipients incapable of self-preservation allowed.) 
Section 202; add definition of Assisting Living Facilities to read as follows. 
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES. A building or part thereof housing persons, on a 24-hour basis, who because of age, mental disability or other reasons, live in a supervised residential environment which provides personal care services. The occupants are capable of responding to an emergency situation without physical assistance from staff. 
(Reason: The code references Assisted Living facilities and definition was deleted.) 
Section 202; change definition of "Atrium" as follows: 
ATRIUM. An opening connecting three or more stories. {Balance remains unchanged} 
(Reason: Accepted practice in the region based on legacy codes. Section 1019 permits unenclosed two story stairways under certain circumstances.) 
Section 202; add definition of "Repair Garage" as follows: 
REPAIR GARAGE. A building, structure or portion thereof used for servicing or repairing motor vehicles. This occupancy shall also include garages involved in minor repair, modification and servicing of motor vehicles for items such as lube changes, inspections, windshield repair or replacement, shocks, minor part replacement and other such minor repairs. 
(Reason: The code references aligns with fire code) 
Section 202; amend definition of SPECIAL INSPECTOR to read as follows: 
SPECIAL INSPECTOR. A qualified person employed or retained by an approved agency who shall prove to the satisfaction of the registered design professional in responsible charge and the Building Official as having the competence necessary to inspect a particular type of construction requiring special inspection. 
(Reason: The registered design professional in responsible charge should be included.) 
Option B 
Section 202; amend definition to read as follows: 
HIGH-RISE BUILDING. A building with an occupied floor located more than 55 feet (16 764 mm) above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access. 
(Reason: To define high-rise, as it influences sprinkler requirement thresholds based on the firefighting capabilities of a jurisdiction.) 
Section 303.1.3; add a sentence to read as follows: 
303.1.3 Associated with Group E occupancies. A room or space used for assembly purposes that is associated with a Group E occupancy is not considered a separate occupancy Except when applying the assembly requirements of Chapter 10 and 11. 
(Reason: To clarify that egress and accessibility requirements are applicable for assembly areas, i.e., cafeteria, auditoriums, etc.) 
Section 304.1; add the following to the list of occupancies: 
Fire stations 
Police stations with detention facilities for 5 or less 
(Reason: Consistent with regional practice dating back to the legacy codes.) 
Section 307.1.1; add the following sentence to Exception 4: 
4.  Cleaning establishments ... {Text unchanged} ... with Section 707 or 1-hour horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 or both. See also IFC Chapter 21, Dry Cleaning Plant provisions. 
(Reason: To call attention to detailed requirements in the Fire Code.) 
Section 403.1, Exception 3; change to read as follows: 
3.  The open air portion of a building [remainder unchanged] 
(Reason: To clarify enclosed portions are not exempt.) 
Section 403.3, Exception; delete item 2. 
(Reason: To provide adequate fire protection to enclosed areas.) 
Section 403.3.2; change to read as follows: 
[F] 403.3.2 Water supply to required fire pumps. In buildings that are more than 120 feet (36.5 m) in building height, required fire pumps shall be supplied by connections to no fewer than two water mains located in different streets. Separate supply piping shall be provided between each connection to the water main and the pumps. Each connection and the supply piping between the connection and the pumps shall be sized to supply the flow and pressure required for the pumps to operate. 
Exception: {No change to exception.} 
(Reason: The 2009 edition of the IFC added this requirement based on a need for redundancy of the water supply similar to the redundancy of the power supply to the fire pumps required for such tall buildings, partially due to the fact that these buildings are rarely fully evacuated in a fire event. More commonly, the alarm activates on the floor of the event, the floor above and the floor below. Back-up power to the fire pump becomes critical for this reason. Certainly, the power is pointless if the water supply is impaired for any reason, so a similar requirement is provided here for redundant water supplies. The 2015 edition changes the requirement to only apply to very tall buildings over 420 ft. This amendment modifies/lowers the requirement to 120 ft., based on this same height requirement for fire service access elevators. Again, the language from the 2009 and 2012 editions of the code applied to any high-rise building. This compromise at 120 feet is based on the above technical justification of defend-in-place scenarios in fire incidents in such tall structures.) 
Section 404.5; delete Exception. 
(Reason: Consistent with amended atrium definition.) 
Section 406.3.5.1 Carport separation; add sentence to read as follows: 
A fire separation is not required between a Group R-2 and U carport provided that the carport is entirely open on all sides and that the distance between the two is at least 10 feet (3048 mm). 
(Reason: Simplifies the fire separation distance and eliminates the need to obtain opening information on existing buildings when adding carports in existing apartment complexes. Consistent with legacy codes in effect in region for years and no record of problems with car fires spreading to apartments as a result.) 
Section 506.2.2; add sentence to read as follows: 
506.3.2.1 Open Space Limits. Such open space shall be either on the same lot or dedicated for public use and shall be accessed from a street or approved fire lane. In order to be considered as accessible, if not in direct contact with a street or fire lane, a minimum 10-foot wide pathway meeting fire department access from the street or approved fire lane shall be provided. 
(Reason: To define what is considered accessible. Consistent with regional amendment to IFC 504.1.) 
Section 712.1.9, change item 4 to read as follows: 
4.  Is not open to a corridor in Group I and H occupancies. 
(Reason: To be consistent with amended definition of an atrium.) 
Section 901.6.1; add Section 901.6.1.1 to read as follows: 
901.6.1.1 Standpipe Testing. Building owners/managers must maintain and test standpipe systems as per NFPA 25 requirements. The following additional requirements shall be applied to the testing that is required every 5 years: 
1.  The piping between the Fire Department Connection (FDC) and the standpipe shall be backflushed when foreign material is present, and also hydrostatically tested for all FDCs on any type of standpipe system. Hydrostatic testing shall also be conducted in accordance with NFPA 25 requirements for the different types of standpipe systems. 
2.  For any manual (dry or wet) standpipe system not having an automatic water supply capable of flowing water through the standpipe, the tester shall connect hose from a fire hydrant or portable pumping system (as approved by the fire code official) to each FDC, and flow water through the standpipe system to the roof outlet to verify that each inlet connection functions properly. Confirm that there are no open hose valves prior to introducing water into a dry standpipe. There is no required pressure criteria at the outlet. Verify that check valves function properly and that there are no closed control valves on the system. 
3.  Any pressure relief, reducing, or control valves shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of NFPA 25. All hose valves shall be exercised. 
4.  If the FDC is not already provided with approved caps, the contractor shall install such caps for all FDCs as required by the fire code official. 
5.  Upon successful completion of standpipe test, place a blue tag (as per Texas Administrative Code, Fire Sprinkler Rules for Inspection, Test and Maintenance Service (ITM) Tag) at the bottom of each standpipe riser in the building. The tag shall be check-marked as "Fifth Year" for Type of ITM, and the note on the back of the tag shall read "5 Year Standpipe Test" at a minimum. 
6.  The procedures required by Texas Administrative Code Fire Sprinkler Rules with regard to Yellow Tags and Red Tags or any deficiencies noted during the testing, including the required notification of the local Authority Having Jurisdiction (fire code official) shall be followed. 
7.  Additionally, records of the testing shall be maintained by the owner and contractor, if applicable, as required by the State Rules mentioned above and NFPA 25. 
8.  Standpipe system tests where water will be flowed external to the building shall not be conducted during freezing conditions or during the day prior to expected night time freezing conditions. 
9.  Contact the fire code official for requests to remove existing fire hose from Class II and III standpipe systems where employees are not trained in the utilization of this firefighting equipment. All standpipe hose valves must remain in place and be provided with an approved cap and chain when approval is given to remove hose by the fire code official. 
(Reason: Increases the reliability of the fire protection system and re-emphasizes the requirements of NFPA 25 relative to standpipe systems, as well as ensuring that FDC connections are similarly tested/maintained to ensure operation in an emergency incident.) 
Section 903.1.1; change to read as follows: 
[F] 903.1.1 Alternative protection. Alternative automatic fire-extinguishing systems complying with Section 904 shall be permitted in addition to automatic sprinkler protection where recognized by the applicable standard, or as approved by the fire code official. 
(Reason: Such alternative systems do not provide the reliability of automatic sprinkler protection in general. An applicant could pursue an Alternate Method request to help mitigate the reliability issues with these alternative systems with the fire code official if so desired, or there may be circumstances in which the fire code official is acceptable to allowing an alternate system in lieu of sprinklers, such as kitchen hoods or paint booths. This also meets with local practices in the region.) 
Section 903.2; add the following: 
[F] 903.2 Where required. Approved automatic sprinkler systems in new buildings and structures shall be provided in the locations described in Sections 903.2.1 through 903.2.12. Automatic Sprinklers shall not be installed in elevator machine rooms, elevator machine spaces, and elevator hoistways, other than pits where such sprinklers would not necessitate shunt trip requirements under any circumstances. Storage shall not be allowed within the elevator machine room. Signage shall be provided at the entry doors to the elevator machine room indicating "ELEVATOR MACHINERY - NO STORAGE ALLOWED." 
(Reason: Firefighter and public safety. This amendment eliminates the shunt trip requirement of the International Building Code Section 3006.5 for the purpose of elevator passenger and firefighter safety. This amendment is contingent on the Building Code amendment eliminating the Exceptions to Section 3006.4, such that passive fire barriers for these areas are maintained. This also meets with local practices in the region.) 
[F] Section 903.2; delete the exception. 
(Reason: The exception deletion is due to the fact that such telecom areas pose an undue fire risk to the structural integrity of the building. This also meets with local practices in the region.) 
Section 903.2.9; add Section 903.2.9.3 to read as follows: 
[F] 903.2.9.3 Self-service storage facility. An automatic sprinkler system shall be installed throughout all self-service storage facilities. 
(Reason: Fire departments are unable to inspect these commercial occupancies and are unaware of the contents being stored. Previous allowance to separate units by fire barriers is difficult to enforce maintenance after opening.) 
Section 903.2.11; change 903.2.11.3 and add 903.2.11.7, 903.2.11.8, and 903.2.11.9 as follows: 
903.2.11.3 Buildings 35 feet or more in height. An automatic sprinkler system shall be installed throughout buildings that have one or more stories, other than penthouses in compliance with Section 1510 of the International Building Code, located 35 feet 10 668 mm) or more above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access, measured to the finished floor. 
Exceptions: Open parking structures in compliance with Section 406.5 of the International Building Code, having no other occupancies above the subject garage. 
903.2.11.7 High-Piled Combustible Storage. For any building with a clear height exceeding 12 feet (4572 mm), see Chapter 32 of the IFC to determine if those provisions apply. 
903.2.11.8 Spray Booths and Rooms. New and existing spray booths and spraying rooms shall be protected by an approved automatic fire-extinguishing system. 
903.2.11.9 Buildings Over 6,000 sq. ft. An automatic sprinkler system shall be installed throughout all buildings with a building area 6,000 sq. ft. or greater and in all existing buildings that are enlarged to be 6,000 sq. ft. or greater. For the purpose of this provision, fire walls shall not define separate buildings. 
Exception: Open parking garages in compliance with Section 406.5 of the International Building Code. 
(Reason: Provides jurisdictions options as to their desired level of sprinkler protection based on multiple factors including firefighting philosophies/capabilities.) 
Section 903.3.1.1.1; change to read as follows: 
[F] 903.3.1.1.1 Exempt locations. When approved by the fire code official, automatic sprinklers shall not be required in the following rooms or areas where such ...{text unchanged}... because it is damp, of fire-resistance-rated construction or contains electrical equipment. 
1.  Any room where the application of water, or flame and water, constitutes a serious life or fire hazard. 
2.  Any room or space where sprinklers are considered undesirable because of the nature of the contents, when approved by the code official. 
3.  Generator and transformer rooms, under the direct control of a public utility, separated from the remainder of the building by walls and floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assemblies having a fire-resistance rating of not less than 2 hours. 
4.  Elevator machine rooms, machinery spaces, and hoistways, other than pits where such sprinklers would not necessitate shunt trip requirements under any circumstances. 
5.  {Delete.} 
(Reason: Gives more direction to code official. Exception 4 deleted to provide protection where fire risks are poorly addressed. Amendment 903.2 addresses Exception 5. above relative to the elimination of sprinkler protection in these areas to avoid the shunt trip requirement.) 
Section 903.3.1.2.3; add section to read as follows: 
[F] Section 903.3.1.2.3 Attics and Attached Garages. Sprinkler protection is required in attic spaces of such buildings two or more stories in height, in accordance with NFPA 13 and or NFPA 13R requirements, and attached garages. 
(Reason: Attic protection is required due to issues with fire exposure via soffit vents, as well as firefighter safety. Several jurisdictions indicated experience with un-protected attic fires resulting in displacement of all building occupants. NFPA 13 provides for applicable attic sprinkler protection requirements, as well as exemptions to such, based on noncombustible construction, etc. Attached garages already require sprinklers via NFPA 13R - this amendment just re-emphasizes the requirement.) 
Section 903.3.1.3; change to read as follows: 
[F] 903.3.1.3 NFPA 13D sprinkler systems. Automatic sprinkler systems installed in one- and two-family dwellings; Group R-3; Group R-4 Condition 1 and townhouses shall be permitted to be installed throughout in accordance with NFPA 13D or in accordance with state law. 
(Reason: To allow the use of the Plumbing section of the IRC and recognize current state stipulations in this regard.) 
Section 903.3.1.4; add to read as follows: 
[F] 903.3.1.4 Freeze protection. Freeze protection systems for automatic fire sprinkler systems shall be in accordance with the requirements of the applicable referenced NFPA standard and this section. 
903.3.1.4.1 Attics. Only dry-pipe, preaction, or listed antifreeze automatic fire sprinkler systems shall be allowed to protect attic spaces. 
Exception: Wet-pipe fire sprinkler systems shall be allowed to protect non-ventilated attic spaces where: 
1.  The attic sprinklers are supplied by a separate floor control valve assembly to allow ease of draining the attic system without impairing sprinklers throughout the rest of the building, and 
2.  Adequate heat shall be provided for freeze protection as per the applicable referenced NFPA standard, and 
3.  The attic space is a part of the building's thermal, or heat, envelope, such that insulation is provided at the roof deck, rather than at the ceiling level. 
903.3.1.4.2 Heat trace/insulation. Heat trace/insulation shall only be allowed where approved by the fire code official for small sections of large diameter water-filled pipe. 
(Reason: In the last few years, severe winters brought to light several issues with current practices for sprinklering attics, not the least of which was wet-pipe sprinklers in ventilated attics provided with space heaters, etc., for freeze protection of such piping. This practice is not acceptable for the protection of water-filled piping in a ventilated attic space as it does not provide a reliable means of maintaining the minimum 40 degrees required by NFPA, wastes energy, and presents a potential ignition source to the attic space. Listed antifreeze is specifically included because NFPA currently allows such even though there is no currently listed antifreeze at the time of development of these amendments. The intent of this amendment is to help reduce the large number of freeze breaks that have occurred in the past with water-filled wet-pipe sprinkler systems in the future, most specifically in attic spaces.) 
Section 903.3.5; add a second paragraph to read as follows: 
[F] Water supply as required for such systems shall be provided in conformance with the supply requirements of the respective standards; however, every water-based fire protection system shall be designed with a 10 psi safety factor. Reference Section 507.4 for additional design requirements. 
(Reason: To define uniform safety factor.) 
Section 903.4; add a second paragraph after the exceptions to read as follows: 
[F] Sprinkler and standpipe system water-flow detectors shall be provided for each floor tap to the sprinkler system and shall cause an alarm upon detection of water flow for more than 45 seconds. All control valves in the sprinkler and standpipe systems except for fire department hose connection valves shall be electrically supervised to initiate a supervisory signal at the central station upon tampering. 
(Reason: To avoid significant water losses. Consistent with amendment to IFC 905.9.) 
Section 903.4.2; add second paragraph to read as follows: 
[F] The alarm device required on the exterior of the building shall be a weatherproof horn/strobe notification appliance with a minimum 75 candela strobe rating, installed as close as practicable to the fire department connection. 
(Reason: Fire department connections are not always located at the riser; this allows the fire department faster access.) 
Section 905.2; change to read as follows: 
[F] 905.2 Installation standard. Standpipe systems shall be installed in accordance with this section and NFPA 14. Manual dry standpipe systems shall be supervised with a minimum of 10 psig and a maximum of 40 psig air pressure with a high/low alarm. 
(Reason: To define manual dry standpipe supervision requirements. Helps ensure the integrity of the standpipe system via supervision, such that open hose valves will result in a supervisory low air alarm.) 
Section 905.3; add Section 905.3.9 and exception to read as follows: 
[F] 905.3.9 Buildings exceeding 10,000 sq. ft. In buildings exceeding 10,000 square feet in area per story and where any portion of the building's interior area is more than 200 feet (60960 mm) of travel, vertically and horizontally, from the nearest point of fire department vehicle access, Class I automatic wet or manual wet standpipes shall be provided. 
Exceptions: 
1.  Automatic dry and semi-automatic dry standpipes are allowed as provided for in NFPA 14. 
2.  R-2 occupancies of four stories or less in height having no interior corridors. 
(Reason: Allows for the rapid deployment of hose lines to the body of the fire.) 
Section 905.4, change Item 1., 3., and 5. and add Item 7. to read as follows: 
[F] 1.  In every required exit stairway, a hose connection shall be provided for each story above and below grade plane. Hose connections shall be located at an intermediate landing between stories, unless otherwise approved by the fire code official. 
2.  {No change.} 
3.  In every exit passageway, at the entrance from the exit passageway to other areas of a building. 
Exception: Where floor areas adjacent to an exit passageway are reachable from an exit stairway hose connection by a ...{No change to rest.} 
4.  {No change.} 
5.  Where the roof has a slope less than four units vertical in 12 units horizontal (33.3-percent slope), each standpipe shall be provided with a two-way hose connection located to serve the roof or at the highest landing of an exit stairway with stair access to the roof provided in accordance with Section 1011.12. 
6.  {No change.} 
7.  When required by this Chapter, standpipe connections shall be placed adjacent to all required exits to the structure and at two hundred feet (200') intervals along major corridors thereafter, or as otherwise approved by the fire code official. 
(Reason: Item 1., 3., and 5. amendments to remove 'interior' will help to clarify that such connections are required for all 'exit' stairways, to ensure firefighter capabilities are not diminished in these tall buildings, simply because the stair is on the exterior of the building. Item 5. reduces the amount of pressure required to facilitate testing, and provides backup protection for fire fighter safety. Item 7. allows for the rapid deployment of hose lines to the body of the fire.) 
Section 905.9; add a second paragraph after the exceptions to read as follows: 
[F] Sprinkler and standpipe system water-flow detectors shall be provided for each floor tap to the sprinkler system and shall cause an alarm upon detection of water flow for more than 45 seconds. All control valves in the sprinkler and standpipe systems except for fire department hose connection valves shall be electrically supervised to initiate a supervisory signal at the central station upon tampering. 
(Reason: To avoid significant water losses. Consistent with amendment to IFC 903.4.) 
Section 907.1; add Section 907.1.4 and 907.1.4.1 to read as follows: 
[F] 907.1.4 Design standards. Where a new fire alarm system is installed, the devices shall be addressable. Fire alarm systems utilizing more than 20 smoke detectors shall have analog initiating devices. 
(Reason: Provides for the ability of descriptive identification of alarms, and reduces need for panel replacement in the future. Updated wording to match the language of the new requirement at 907.5.2.3. Change of terminology allows for reference back to definitions of NFPA 72) 
Section 907.2.1; change to read as follows: 
[F] 907.2.1 Group A. A manual fire alarm system that activates the occupant notification system in accordance with Section 907.5 shall be installed in Group A occupancies where the having an occupant load of 300 or more persons or more than 100 persons above or below the lowest level of exit discharge. Group A occupancies not separated from one another in accordance with Section 707.3.-10 of the International Building Code shall be considered as a single occupancy for the purposes of applying this section. Portions of Group E occupancies occupied for assembly purposes shall be provided with a fire alarm system as required for the Group E occupancy. 
Exception : {No change.} 
Activation of fire alarm notification appliances shall: 
1.  Cause illumination of the means of egress with light of not less than 1 foot-candle (11 lux) at the walking surface level, and 
2.  Stop any conflicting or confusing sounds and visual distractions. 
(Reason: Increases the requirement to be consistent with Group B requirement. Also addresses issue found in Group A occupancies of reduced lighting levels and other A/V equipment that distracts from fire alarm notification devices or reduces ability of fire alarm system to notify occupants of the emergency condition.) 
Section 907.2.3; change to read as follows: 
[F] 907.2.3 Group E. A manual fire alarm system that initiates the occupant notification signal utilizing an emergency voice/alarm communication system meeting the requirements of Section 907.5.2.2 and installed in accordance with Section 907.6 shall be installed in Group E educational occupancies. When automatic sprinkler systems or smoke detectors are installed, such systems or detectors shall be connected to the building fire alarm system. An approved smoke detection system shall be installed in Group E day care occupancies. Unless separated by a minimum of 100' open space, all buildings, whether portable buildings or the main building, will be considered one building for alarm occupant load consideration and interconnection of alarm systems. 
Exceptions: 
1.  {No change.} 
1.1.  Residential In-Home day care with not more than 12 children may use interconnected single station detectors in all habitable rooms. (For care of more than five children 21/2 or less years of age, see Section 907.2.6.) 
{No change to remainder of exceptions.} 
(Reason: To distinguish educational from day care occupancy minimum protection requirements. Further, to define threshold at which portable buildings are considered a separate building for the purposes of alarm systems. Exceptions provide consistency with State law concerning such occupancies.) 
Section 907.2.13, Exception 3; change to read as follows: 
[F] 3.  Open air portions of buildings with an occupancy in Group A-5 in accordance with Section 303.1 of the International Building Code; however, this exception does not apply to accessory uses including but not limited to sky boxes, restaurants and similarly enclosed areas. 
(Reason: To indicate that enclosed areas within open air seating type occupancies are not exempted from automatic fire alarm system requirements.) 
Section 907.4.2; add Section 907.4.2.7 to read as follows: 
[F] 907.4.2.7 Type. Manual alarm initiating devices shall be an approved double action type. 
(Reason: Helps to reduce false alarms.) 
Section 907.6.1; add Section 907.6.1.1 to read as follows: 
[F] 907.6.1.1 Wiring Installation. All fire alarm systems shall be installed in such a manner that a failure of any single initiating device or single open in an initiating circuit conductor will not interfere with the normal operation of other such devices. All signaling line circuits (SLC) shall be installed in such a way that a single open will not interfere with the operation of any addressable devices (Class A). Outgoing and return SLC conductors shall be installed in accordance with NFPA 72 requirements for Class A circuits and shall have a minimum of four feet separation horizontal and one foot vertical between supply and return circuit conductors. The initiating device circuit (IDC) from a signaling line circuit interface device may be wired Class B, provided the distance from the interface device to the initiating device is ten feet or less. 
(Reason: To provide uniformity in system specifications and guidance to design engineers. Improves reliability of fire alarm devices and systems.) 
Section 907.6.3; delete all four Exceptions. 
(Reason: To assist responding personnel in locating the emergency event for all fire alarm systems.) 
Section 907.6.6; - add sentence at end of paragraph to read as follows: 
[F] See 907.6.3 for the required information transmitted to the supervising station. 
(Reason: To assist responding personnel in locating the emergency event for all fire alarm systems. This was moved from 907.6.5.3 in the 2012 IFC and reworded to match new code language and sections.) 
Section 909.22; add to read as follows: 
[F] 909.22 Stairway or ramp pressurization alternative. Where the building is equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 and the stair pressurization alternative is chosen for compliance with Building Code requirements for a smokeproof enclosure, interior exit stairways or ramps shall be pressurized to a minimum of 0.10 inches of water (25 Pa) and a maximum of 0.35 inches of water (87 Pa) in the shaft relative to the building measured with all interior exit stairway and ramp doors closed under maximum anticipated conditions of stack effect and wind effect. Such systems shall comply with Section 909, including the installation of a separate fire-fighter's smoke control panel as per Section 909.16, and a Smoke Control Permit shall be required from the Fire Department as per Section 105.7. 
[F] 909.22.1 Ventilating equipment. The activation of ventilating equipment for the stair or ramp pressurization system shall be by smoke detectors installed at each floor level at an approved location at the entrance to the smokeproof enclosure. When the closing device for the stairway or ramp shaft and vestibule doors is activated by smoke detection or power failure, mechanical equipment shall activate and operate at the required performance levels. Smoke detectors shall be installed in accordance with Section 907.3. 
[F] 909.22.1.1 Ventilation systems. Smokeproof enclosure ventilation systems shall be independent of other building ventilation systems. The equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall comply with one of the following: 
1.  Equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall be located exterior to the building and directly connected to the smokeproof enclosure or connected to the smokeproof enclosure by ductwork enclosed by not less than 2-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the Building Code, or both. 
2.  Equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall be located within the smokeproof enclosure with intake or exhaust directly from and to the outside or through ductwork enclosed by not less than 2-hour barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the Building Code, or both. 
3.  Equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall be located within the building if separated from the remainder of the building, including other mechanical equipment, by not less than 2-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the Building Code, or both. 
Exceptions: 
1.  Control wiring and power wiring utilizing a 2-hour rated cable or cable system. 
2.  Where encased with not less than 2 inches (51 mm) of concrete. 
3.  Control wiring and power wiring protected by a listed electrical circuit protective systems with a fire-resistance rating of not less than 2 hours. 
[F] 909.22.1.2 Standby power. Mechanical vestibule and stairway and ramp shaft ventilation systems and automatic fire detection systems shall be provided with standby power in accordance with Section 2702 of the Building Code. 
[F] 909.22.1.3 Acceptance and testing. Before the mechanical equipment is approved, the system shall be tested in the presence of the fire code official to confirm that the system is operating in compliance with these requirements. 
(Reason: To assist with enforcement of such as a smoke control system, as per Section 909.6.3, especially since a permit is now specifically required for such systems in the Fire Code. Also ensures that a firefighter's override panel is provided as per 909.16 for such systems. The above amendment copies the applicable requirements for such systems from Section 909.20 of the Building Code into the Fire Code. Although the published code did copy the elevator pressurization requirements into the Fire Code, it did not copy over the stair pressurization requirements.) 
Section 910.2; change Exception 2. and 3. to read as follows: 
[F] 2.  Only manual smoke and heat removal shall be required in areas of buildings equipped with early suppression fast-response (ESFR) sprinklers. Automatic smoke and heat removal is prohibited. 
3.  Only manual smoke and heat removal shall be required in areas of buildings equipped with control mode special application sprinklers with a response time index of 50(m*S) 1/2 or less that are listed to control a fire in stored commodities with 12 or fewer sprinklers. Automatic smoke and heat removal is prohibited. 
(Reason: Allows the fire department to control the smoke and heat during and after a fire event, while still prohibiting such systems from being automatically activated, which is a potential detriment to the particular sprinkler systems indicated.) 
Section 910.2; add subsections 910.2.3 with exceptions to read as follows: 
[F] 910.2.3 Group H. Buildings and portions thereof used as a Group H occupancy as follows: 
1.  In occupancies classified as Group H-2 or H-3, any of which are more than 15,000 square feet (1394 m 2 ) in single floor area. 
Exception: Buildings of noncombustible construction containing only noncombustible materials. 
2.  In areas of buildings in Group H used for storing Class 2, 3, and 4 liquid and solid oxidizers, Class 1 and unclassified detonable organic peroxides, Class 3 and 4 unstable (reactive) materials, or Class 2 or 3 water-reactive materials as required for a high-hazard commodity classification. 
Exception: Buildings of noncombustible construction containing only noncombustible materials. 
(Reason: Maintains a fire protection device utilized in such occupancies where it is sometimes necessary to allow chemicals to burn out, rather than extinguish.) 
Section 910.3; add section 910.3.4 to read as follows: 
[F] 910.3.4 Vent operation. Smoke and heat vents shall be capable of being operated by approved automatic and manual means. Automatic operation of smoke and heat vents shall conform to the provisions of Sections 910.3.2.1 through 910.3.2.3. 
[F] 910.3.4.1 Sprinklered buildings. Where installed in buildings equipped with an approved automatic sprinkler system, smoke and heat vents shall be designed to operate automatically. 
The automatic operating mechanism of the smoke and heat vents shall operate at a temperature rating at least 100 degrees F (approximately 38 degrees Celsius) greater than the temperature rating of the sprinklers installed. 
Exception: Manual only system per 910.2 
[F] 910.3.4.2 Nonsprinklered buildings. Where installed in buildings not equipped with an approved automatic sprinkler system, smoke and heat vents shall operate automatically by actuation of a heat-responsive device rated at between 100°F (56°C) and 220°F (122°C) above ambient. 
Exception: Listed gravity-operated drop out vents. 
(Reason: Amendment continues to keep applicable wording from prior to the 2012 edition of the IFC. Specifically, automatic activation criteria is no longer specifically required in the published code. Specifying a temperature range at which smoke and heat vents should activate in sprinklered buildings helps to ensure that the sprinkler system has an opportunity to activate and control the fire prior to vent operation.) 
Section 910.4.3.1; change to read as follows: 
[F] 910.4.3.1 Makeup air. Makeup air openings shall be provided within 6 feet (1829 mm) of the floor level. Operation of makeup air openings shall be automatic. The minimum gross area of makeup air inlets shall be 8 square feet per 1,000 cubic feet per minute (0.74 m2 per 0.4719 m3/s) of smoke exhaust. 
(Reason: Makeup air has been required to be automatic for several years now in this region when mechanical smoke exhaust systems are proposed. This allows such systems to be activated from the smoke control panel by first responders without having to physically go around the exterior of the building opening doors manually. Such requires a significant number of first responders on scene to conduct this operation and significantly delays activation and/or capability of the smoke exhaust system.) 
Section 910.4.4; change to read as follows: 
[F] 910.4.4 Activation. The mechanical smoke removal system shall be activated automatically by the automatic sprinkler system or by an approved fire detection system. Individual manual controls shall also be provided. 
Exception: Manual only systems per Section 910.2. 
(Reason: The provision of a manual only mechanical smoke removal system does not provide equivalency with automatic smoke and heat vents. This amendment clarifies that the primary intent is for automatic systems, unless exceptions are provided as in 910.2 - consistent with the charging statements of the section.) 
Section 912.2; add Section 912.2.3 to read as follows: 
[F] 912.2.3 Hydrant distance. An approved fire hydrant shall be located within 100 feet of the fire department connection as the fire hose lays along an unobstructed path. 
(Reason: To accommodate limited hose lengths, improve response times where the FDC is needed to achieve fire control, and improve ease of locating a fire hydrant in those situations also. Also, consistent with NFPA 14 criteria.) 
Section 913.2.1; add second paragraph and exception to read as follows: 
[F] When located on the ground level at an exterior wall, the fire pump room shall be provided with an exterior fire department access door that is not less than 3 ft. in width and 6 ft.-8 in. in height, regardless of any interior doors that are provided. A key box shall be provided at this door, as required by Section 506.1. 
Exception: When it is necessary to locate the fire pump room on other levels or not at an exterior wall, the corridor leading to the fire pump room access from the exterior of the building shall be provided with equivalent fire resistance as that required for the pump room, or as approved by the fire code official. Access keys shall be provided in the key box as required by Section 506.1. 
(Reason: This requirement allows fire fighters safer access to the fire pump room. The requirement allows access without being required to enter the building and locate the fire pump room interior access door during a fire event. The exception recognizes that this will not always be a feasible design scenario for some buildings, and as such, provides an acceptable alternative to protect the pathway to the fire pump room.) 
Section 1006.2.2.6 Add a new Section 1006.2.2.6 as follows: 
1006.2.2.6 Electrical Rooms. For electrical rooms, special exiting requirements may apply. Reference the electrical code as adopted. 
(Reason: Cross reference necessary for coordination with the NEC which has exiting requirements as well.) 
Section 1009.1; add the following Exception 4: 
Exceptions: {previous exceptions unchanged} 
4.  Buildings regulated under State Law and built in accordance with State registered plans, including any variances or waivers granted by the State, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of Section 1009. 
(Reason: To accommodate buildings regulated under Texas State Law and to be consistent with amendments to Chapter 11.) 
Section 1010.1.9.4 Bolt Locks; amend exceptions 3 and 4 as follows: 
Exceptions: 
3.  Where a pair of doors serves an occupant load of less than 50 persons in a Group B, F, M or S occupancy. {Remainder unchanged} 
4.  Where a pair of doors serves a Group A, B, F, M or S occupancy {Remainder unchanged} 
(Reason: Application to M occupancies reflects regional practice; No. 4 expanded to Group A due to it being a similar scenario to other uses; No. 4 was regional practice.) 
Section 1015.8 Window Openings. REVISE text as follows: 
1.  Operable windows where the top of the sill of the opening is located more than 55 feet (16 764 mm) above the finished grade or other surface below and that are provided with window fall prevention devices that comply with ASTM F 2006. 
(Reason: In Option B jurisdictions, change "75 feet" to "55 feet".) 
Section 1020.1 Construction; add exception 6 to read as follows: 
6.  In group B occupancies, corridor walls and ceilings need not be of fire-resistive construction within a single tenant space when the space is equipped with approved automatic smoke-detection within the corridor. The actuation of any detector shall activate self-annunciating alarms audible in all areas within the corridor. Smoke detectors shall be connected to an approved automatic fire alarm system where such system is provided. 
(Reason: Revise the 2012 published NCTCOG amendment to this section to now read closer to that of the City of Dallas 2012 amendment.) 
Section 1029.1.1.1 Delete this section. Spaces under grandstands and bleachers; 
(Reason: Unenforceable.) 
Section 1101.1 Scope; add exception to Section 1101.1 as follows: 
Exception: Components of projects regulated by and registered with Architectural Barriers Division of Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation shall be deemed to be incompliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(Reason: To accommodate buildings regulated under state law. Further clarified in 2015 to mean components that are specifically addressed by TDLR shall be exempt.) 
Section 1203.1; amend to read as follows: 
1203.1 General. Buildings shall be provided with natural ventilation in accordance with Section 1203.4, or mechanical ventilation in accordance with the International Mechanical Code. 
Where air infiltration rate in a dwelling unit is 5 air changes or less per hour when tested with a blower door at a pressure 0.2 inch w.c. (50 Pa) in accordance with Section 402.4.1.2 of the International Energy Conservation Code, the dwelling unit shall be ventilated by mechanical means in accordance with Section 403 of the International Mechanical Code. 
(Reason: See IECC change to performance testing. Whole-house ventilation is recognized as necessary). 
Table 1505.1; delete footnote c and replace footnote b with the following: 
b.  Non-classified roof coverings shall be permitted on buildings of U occupancies having not more than 120 sq. ft. of protected roof area. When exceeding 120 sq. ft. of protected roof area, buildings of U occupancies may use non-rated non-combustible roof coverings. 
c.  [delete] 
(Reason: Conforms to regional practice affording increased fire protection.) 
Section 1505.7; delete the section 
(Reason: Conforms to regional practice.) 
Section 1510.1; add a sentence to read as follows: 
1510.1 General. Materials and methods of applications used for recovering or replacing an existing roof covering shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 15. All individual replacement shingles or shakes shall be in compliance with the rating required by Table 1505.1. 
{text of exception unchanged} 
(Reason: Relocated the text to more appropriate place. Previously was footnote "b" to Table 1505.1) 
Section 1704.2, Special inspections and tests is amended to read as follows: 
1704.2 Special inspections and tests. Where application is made to the Building Official for construction as specified in Section 105, the owner or the owner's authorized agent, or the registered design professional in responsible charge, other than the contractor, shall employ one or more approved agencies to provide special inspections and tests during construction on the types of work listed under Section 1705 and identify the approved agencies to the Building Official. The special inspector shall not be employed by the contractor. These special inspections and tests are in addition to the inspections identified by the Building Official that are identified in Section 110. 
(Reason: The RDPRC should be included in the documentation.) 
Section 1704.2.1, Special inspector qualifications, is amended to read as follows: 
1704.2.1 Special inspector qualifications. Prior to the start of construction and or upon request, the approved agencies shall provide written documentation to the registered design professional in responsible charge and the building official demonstrating the competence and relevant experience or training of the special inspectors who will perform the special inspections and tests during construction. [Remainder unchanged] 
(Reason: The RDPRC should be included in the documentation.) 
Section 1704.2.4, Report requirement, is amended to read as follows: 
1704.2.4 Report requirement. Approved agencies shall keep records of special inspections and tests. The approved agency shall submit reports of special inspections and tests to the Building Official upon request, and to the registered design professional in responsible charge. Individual inspection reports shall indicate that work inspected or tested was or was not completed in conformance to approved construction documents. [Remainder unchanged] 
(Reason: The RDPRC should be included in the documentation and building official can choose to request reports as required.) 
Section 1704.2.5.2, Fabricator approval, is amended to read as follows: 
1704.2.5.1 Fabricator approval. Special inspections during fabrications required by Section 1704 are not required where the work is done on the premises of a fabricator registered and approved to perform such work without special inspection. Approval shall be based upon review of the fabricator's written procedural and quality control manuals and periodic auditing of fabrication practices by an approved agency, or a fabricator that is enrolled in a nationally accepted inspections program. At completion of fabrication, the acceptable or approved fabricator shall submit a certificate of compliance to the owner or the owner's authorized agent or the registered design professional in responsible charge stating that the work was performed in accordance with the approved construction documents. The certificate of compliance shall also be made available to the Building Official upon request. 
(Reason: The RDPRC should be included in the documentation and fabricators can be accepted or approved.) 
Section 2901.1; add a sentence to read as follows: 
[P] 2901.1 Scope. {existing text to remain} The provisions of this Chapter are meant to work in coordination with the provisions of Chapter 4 of the International Plumbing Code. Should any conflicts arise between the two chapters, the Building Official shall determine which provision applies. 
(Reason: Gives building official discretion.) 
Section 2902.1; add a second paragraph to read as follows: 
In other than E Occupancies, the minimum number of fixtures in Table 2902.1 may be lowered, if requested in writing, by the applicant stating reasons for a reduced number and approved by the Building Official. 
(Reason: To allow flexibility for designer to consider specific occupancy needs.) 
Table 2902.1; add footnote f to read as follows: 
f.  Drinking fountains are not required in M Occupancies with an occupant load of 100 or less, B Occupancies with an occupant load of 25 or less, and for dining and/or drinking establishments. 
(Reason: Adjustment meets the needs of specific occupancy types.) 
Section 2902.1.3; add new Section 2902.1.3 to read as follows: 
2902.1.3 Additional fixtures for food preparation facilities. In addition to the fixtures required in this Chapter, all food service facilities shall be provided with additional fixtures set out in this section. 
2902.1.3.1 Hand washing lavatory. At least one hand washing lavatory shall be provided for use by employees that is accessible from food preparation, food dispensing and ware washing areas. Additional hand washing lavatories may be required based on convenience of use by employees. 
2902.1.3.2 Service sink. In new or remodeled food service establishments, at least one service sink or one floor sink shall be provided so that it is conveniently located for the cleaning of mops or similar wet floor cleaning tool and for the disposal of mop water and similar liquid waste. The location of the service sink(s) and/or mop sink(s) shall be approved by the City of Wylie. 
(Reason: Coordinates Health law requirements with code language for consistent regional practice.) 
Section 3002.1 Hoistway Enclosure Protection; add exceptions to read as follows: 
Exceptions: 
1.  Elevators wholly located within atriums complying with Section 404 shall not require hoistway enclosure protection. 
2.  Elevators in open or enclosed parking garages that serve only the parking garage, and complying with Sections 406.5 and 406.6, respectively, shall not require hoistway enclosure protection. 
(Reason: Provides specific Code recognition that elevators within atriums and within parking garages do not require hoistway enclosure protection.) 
Section 3005.4 Machine rooms, control rooms, machinery spaces and control spaces. 
Revise text to read: 
Elevator machine rooms, control rooms, control spaces and machinery spaces shall be enclosed with fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711, or both. 
[Remainder unchanged] 
(Reason: This amendment eliminates code language so as to be consistent with the regional goal to require passive enclosures of these areas unless a hoistway enclosure is not required by other Code provisions. See companion change to eliminate fire sprinklers thereby eliminating shunt trip.) 
Section 3005.7 add a Section 3005.7 as follows: 
3005.7 Fire Protection in Machine rooms, control rooms, machinery spaces and control spaces. 
3005.7.1 Automatic sprinkler system. The building shall be equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1, except as otherwise permitted by Section 903.3.1.1.1 and as prohibited by Section 3005.7.2.1. 
3005.7.2.1 Prohibited locations. Automatic sprinklers shall not be installed in machine rooms, elevator machinery spaces, control rooms, control spaces and elevator hoist-ways. 
3005.7.2.2 Sprinkler system monitoring. The sprinkler system shall have a sprinkler control valve supervisory switch and water-flow initiating device provided for each floor that is monitored by the building's fire alarm system. 
3005.7.3 Water protection. An approved method to prevent water from infiltrating into the hoistway enclosure from the operation of the automatic sprinkler system outside the elevator lobby shall be provided. 
3005.7.4 Shunt trip. Means for elevator shutdown in accordance with Section 3005.5 shall not be installed. 
(Reason: Firefighter and public safety. This amendment eliminates the shunt trip requirement of the International Building Code Section 3005.5 for the purpose of elevator passenger and firefighter safety. 
The new section above is intended to be identical to Sections 3007.2, 3007.3, and 3007.4 for Fire Service Access Elevators and Sections 3008.2, 3008.3 and 3008.4 for Occupant Evacuation Elevators.) 
Section 3005.8 add Section 3005.8 as follows: 
3005.8 Storage. Storage shall not be allowed within the elevator machine room, control room, machinery spaces and or control spaces. Provide approved signage at each entry to the above listed locations stating: "No Storage Allowed." 
(Reason: Reinforces the need to maintain space clean and free of combustibles. See companion change to eliminate fire sprinklers therein, to always require an enclosure-with IBC 3005.4 exceptions deleted-resulting in the limited need for a shunt trip system.) 
Section 3006.2, Hoistway opening protection required. Revise text as follows: 
5.  The building is a high rise and the elevator hoistway is more than 55 feet (16 764 mm) in height. The height of the hoistway shall be measured from the lowest floor at or above grade to the highest floors served by the hoistway. 
(Reason: 2015 IBC text does not address hoistways that are >75' in height that are both below grade and above grade but not located above the high rise classification nor does the IBC address hoistways wholly located above grade such as those that serve above sky lobbies.) 
Section 3109.1; change to read as follows: 
3109.1 General. Swimming pools shall comply with the requirements of sections 3109.2 through 3109.5 and other applicable sections of this code and complying with applicable state laws. 
(Reason: To recognize "state requirements".)

    The following articles, paragraphs, and sentences of the 2017 National Electrical Code (NEC) are hereby amended as follows: 
Article 100; add the following to definitions: 
Engineering Supervision. Supervision by a Qualified State of Texas Licensed Professional Engineer engaged primarily in the design or maintenance of electrical installations. 
(Reason for change: To better define the qualifications for engineering supervision. This term is used twenty-four times in the 2017 National Electrical Code.) 
Article 100; remove the amendment to the following definition: 
Intersystem Bonding Termination. A device that provides a means for connecting intersystem bonding conductors for communication systems to the grounding electrode system. 
(Reason for change: Remove the above amendment. Updates to the 2017 National Electrical Code Article 250.94(A) only accommodate connecting communication systems to an intersystem bonding termination device, but Article 250.94(B) provides an alternative or other means. 
Article 110.2; change the following to read as follows: 
110.2 Approval. The conductors and equipment required or permitted by this Code shall be acceptable only if approved. Approval of equipment may be evident by listing and labeling of equipment by a Nationally Recognized Testing Lab (NRTL) with a certification mark of that laboratory or a qualified third party inspection agency approved by the AHJ. 
Exception: Unlisted equipment that is relocated to another location within a jurisdiction or is field modified is subject to the approval by the AHJ. This approval may be by a field evaluation by a NRTL or qualified third party inspection agency approved by the AHJ. 
Informational Note No. 1: See 90.7, Examination of Equipment for Safety, and 110.3, Examination, Identification, Installation, and Use of Equipment. See definitions of Approved, Identified, Labeled, and Listed. 
Informational Note No. 2: Manufacturer's self-certification of equipment may not necessarily comply with U.S. product safety standards as certified by an NRTL. 
Informational Note No. 3: National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 790 and 791 provide an example of an approved method for qualifying a third party inspection agency. 
(Reason for change: To add clarity and provide more positive options for enforcement and approval of unlisted equipment.) 
Article 210.52(G) (1) Garages: remove the amendment that deleted the following: 
(1)  Garages. In each attached garage and in each detached garage with electric power. At least one receptacle outlet shall be installed for each car space. 
(Reason FOR CHANGE: Updates to this section in the 2017 National Electrical Code provided relief by removing "shall not supply outlets outside of the garage.") 
Article 500.8 (A) (3); change to read as follows: 
500.8 Equipment. Articles 500 through 504 require equipment construction and installation that ensure safe performance under conditions of proper use and maintenance. 
Informational Note No. 1: It is important that inspection authorities and users exercise more than ordinary care with regard to installation and maintenance. 
Informational Note No. 2: Since there is no consistent relationship between explosion properties and ignition temperature, the two are independent requirements. 
Informational Note No. 3: Low ambient conditions require special consideration. Explosion proof or dust-ignition proof equipment may not be suitable for use at temperatures lower than -25°C (-13°F) unless they are identified for low-temperature service. However, at low ambient temperatures, flammable concentrations of vapors may not exist in a location classified as Class I, Division 1 at normal ambient temperature. 
(A)  Suitability. Suitability of identified equipment shall be determined by one of the following: 
(1)  Equipment listing or labeling; 
(2)  Evidence of equipment evaluation from a qualified testing laboratory or inspection agency concerned with product evaluation; or, 
(3)  Evidence acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction such as a manufacturer's self-evaluation or. An engineering judgment signed and sealed by a qualified licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. 
Informational Note: Additional documentation for equipment may include certificates demonstrating compliance with applicable equipment standards, indicating special conditions of use, and other pertinent information. 
(Reason FOR CHANGE: Carry over from previous amendment with change to better define the qualifications for an engineering judgment.) 
Article 505.7 (A) changed to read as follows: 
505.7 Special Precaution. Article 505 requires equipment construction and installation that ensures safe performance under conditions of proper use and maintenance. 
Informational Note No. 1: It is important that inspection authorities and users exercise more than ordinary care with regard to the installation and maintenance of electrical equipment in hazardous (classified) locations. 
Informational Note No. 2: Low ambient conditions require special consideration. Electrical equipment depending on the protection techniques described by 505.8(A) may not be suitable for use at temperatures lower than -20°C (-4°F) unless they are identified for use at lower temperatures. However, at low ambient temperatures, flammable concentrations of vapors may not exist in a location classified Class I, Zones 0, 1, or 2 at normal ambient temperature. 
(A)  Implementation of Zone Classification System. Classification of areas, engineering and design, selection of equipment and wiring methods, installation, and inspection shall be performed by a qualified licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. 
(Reason FOR CHANGE: Carry over from previous amendment with change to better define the qualifications for an engineering judgment.) 
Article 517.30 Essential Electrical Systems for Hospitals; remove the amendment that created a new (H) and added the following language: 
(G)  Coordination. Overcurrent protective devices serving the essential electrical system shall be coordinated for the period of time that a fault's duration extends beyond 0.1 second. 
E xception No. 1: Between transformer primary and secondary overcurrent protective devices, where only one overcurrent protective device or set of overcurrent protective devices exists on the transformer secondary. 
Exception No. 2: Between overcurrent protective devices of the same size (ampere rating) in series. 
Informational Note: The terms coordination and coordinated as used in this section do not cover the full range of overcurrent conditions. 
(Reason FOR CHANGE: Due to no action by the 2017 code-making panel 15 and NFPA 99, this amendment is not applicable.) 
Article 600.6(A) (1) At Point of Entry to a Sign; Exception 1 changed to read as follows: 
Exception No. 1: A disconnect shall not be required for branch circuits(s) or feeder conductor(s) passing through the sign where enclosed in a Chapter 3 listed raceway or metal-jacketed cable identified for the location. The conductor(s) shall not serve the sign body or sign enclosure where passing through. 
Article 600.6(A) (1) At Point of Entry to a Sign; create a new Exception No. 2 to add the following language: 
Exception No. 2: A disconnect shall not be required at the point of entry to a sign body, sign enclosure, or pole for branch circuit conductor(s). The conductors shall be enclosed in a Chapter 3 listed raceway or metal-jacketed cable identified for the location. The conductor(s) shall be routed to a device box which contains the disconnect. A field-applied permanent warning label that is visible during servicing shall be applied to the raceway at or near the point of entry into the sign enclosure or sign body. The warning label shall comply with 110.21(B) and state the following: "Danger. This raceway contains energized conductors." The marking shall include the location of the disconnecting means for the energized conductor(s). The disconnecting means shall be capable of being locked in the open position in accordance with 110.25. 
Article 600.6(A) (1) At Point of Entry to a Sign; move the original Exception 2 to create a new Exception No. 3 and add the following language: 
Exception No. 3: A disconnect shall not be required at the point of entry to a sign enclosure or sign body for branch circuit(s) or feeder conductor(s) that supply an internal panelboard(s) in a sign enclosure or sign body. The conductors shall be enclosed in a Chapter 3 listed raceway or metal-jacketed cable identified for the location. A field-applied permanent warning label that is visible during servicing shall be applied to the raceway at or near the point of entry into the sign enclosure or sign body. The warning label shall comply with 110.21(B) and state the following: "Danger. This raceway contains energized conductors." The marking shall include the location of the disconnecting means for the energized conductor(s). The disconnecting means shall be capable of being locked in the open position in accordance with 110.25. 
(2017 Code) Informational Note: The location of the disconnect is intended to allow service or maintenance personnel complete and local control of the disconnecting means. 
(Reason FOR CHANGE: This is a modification of the nationwide sign manufacturing practice that was standard before the 2014 Code revision. It is more reasonable but not less than the current Code requirements. It provides local control of the disconnect by service personnel as the informational note suggests, while requiring a sign disconnect to be at or within sight of the sign. This also allows sign designers more flexibility in the placement of the disconnecting means in relation to the location of the sign.) 
Article 680.25(A) remove the amendment that added the following language and exception: 
680.25 Feeders. These provisions shall apply to any feeder on the supply side of panelboards supplying branch circuits for pool equipment covered in Part II of this article and on the load side of the service equipment or the source of a separately derived system. 
(A)  Wiring Methods. 
(1)  Feeders. Feeders shall be installed in rigid metal conduit, intermediate metal conduit. The following wiring methods shall be permitted if not subject to physical damage: 
(1)  Liquidtight flexible nonmetallic conduit 
(2)  Rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit 
(3)  Reinforced thermosetting resin conduit 
(4)  Electrical metallic tubing where installed on or in a building 
(5)  Electrical nonmetallic tubing where installed within a building 
(6)  Type MC Cable where installed within a building and if not subject to corrosive environment 
(Reason FOR CHANGE: Updates to this section in the 2017 National Electrical Code provided relief by recognizing these wiring methods.)

For the purpose of fire sprinkler protection and fire alarm requirements included in this section, the work area shall be extended to include at least the entire tenant space or spaces bounded by walls capable of resisting the passage of smoke containing the subject work area, and if the work area includes a corridor, hallway, or other exit access, then such corridor, hallway, or other exit access shall be protected in its entirety on that particular floor level. 
(Reason: The intent is to avoid work area protection that would result in partial sprinkler or fire alarm protection. Partial sprinkler protection not delineated by walls would be a clear violation of NFPA 13 and would not allow the sprinkler to perform or function as intended. Also, partial fire alarm coverage is a clear violation of the Fire Code, NFPA 72, and ADA.) 
Section 804.2.2, Number 2; change Exception to read as follows: 
Exception: Where the building does not have sufficient municipal water supply for design of a fire sprinkler system available to the floor without installation of a new fire pump, fire sprinkler protection shall not be required.

Section 804.2.5; change Exception to read as follows: 
Exception: Supervision is not required where the Fire Code does not require such for new construction. 
(Reason: The published exceptions are over-reaching and will result in inconsistencies among supervised protection systems and cause confusion for first responders as well.) 
Section 804.3; change section to read as follows: 
804.3 Standpipes. Refer to Section 1103.6 of the Fire Code for retroactive standpipe requirements. 
{Delete rest of Section 804.3.}

Section 805.3.1.2; add change to read as follows: 
805.3.1.2 Fire Escapes required. For other than Group I-2, where more than one exit is required an existing fire escape complying with section 805.3.1.2.1 shall be accepted as providing one of the required means of egress. 
(Reason: Higher level of safety by not allowing new fire escapes.)

805.3.1.2.1 Fire Escape access and details - ... 
2.  Access to a fire escape shall be through a door ... 
3.  Strike whole section 
5.  In all building of Group E occupancy up to and including the 12th grade, building of Group I occupancy, boarding houses, and childcare centers, ladders of any type are prohibited on fire escapes used as a required means of egress. 
(Reason: Higher level of safety by not allowing new fire escapes. Consistency with language and defined term in IBC.) 
Section 805.5.2 Transoms Add note to read as follows: 
B and E occupancies are not included in the list and consideration should be given to adding them depending on existing buildings stock. 
(Reason: Transom windows were historically a common practice in school buildings and each jurisdiction should evaluate the impact on their stakeholders and their community with regards to section) 
Section 806.2; add an exception to read as follows: 
Exception: Components of projects regulated by and registered with Architectural Barriers Division of Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation shall be deemed to be incompliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(Reason: with COG amendments to Section 1101.2 of IBC) 
Section 904.1; add sentence to read as follows: 
For the purpose of fire sprinkler protection and fire alarm requirements included in this section, the work area shall be extended to include at least the entire tenant space or spaces bounded by walls containing the subject work area, and if the work area includes a corridor, hallway, or other exit access, then such corridor, hallway, or other exit access shall be protected in its entirety on that particular floor level. 
(Reason: The intent is to avoid work area protection that would result in partial sprinkler or fire alarm protection. Partial sprinkler protection not delineated by walls would be a clear violation of NFPA 13 and the Fire Code and would not allow the sprinkler system to perform or function as intended. Also, partial fire alarm coverage is a clear violation of the Fire Code, NFPA 72, and ADA.) 
Section 904.1; add sentence to read as follows: 
904.1.1 High-rise buildings. An automatic sprinkler system shall be provided in work areas of high-rise building. 
(Reason: Level 3 alterations are affecting more than 50% of the existing high-rise building, and as such, sprinkler protection is more than justifiable, even when fire pumps, etc., are necessary. It is noted that the work area method is one of three different methods available to the designer/owner in the IEBC.) 
Section 1103.5 Flood Hazard areas. (Jurisdictions may consider the option to amend or delete depending on local enforcement and flood hazard ordinances.) 
(Reason: Flood hazard ordinances may be administered by other departments within the city.) 
Section 1201.4 Flood hazard areas. (Jurisdictions may consider the option to amend or delete depending on local enforcement and flood hazard ordinances.) 
(Reason: Flood hazard ordinances may be administered by other departments within the city.) 
Section 1302.7 Flood hazard areas. (Jurisdictions may consider the option to amend or delete depending on local enforcement and flood hazard ordinances.) 
(Reason: Flood hazard ordinances may be administered by other departments within the city.) 
Section 1401.2; change to read as follows: 
1401.2 Applicability. Structures existing prior to the date of an approved final inspection issued under a code edition which is at least two published code editions preceding the currently adopted building code; or a change of occupancy, {rest of section un-changed}. 
(Reason: For consistency with amendment in Chapter 2 relative to allowable use of this code for existing building.) 
Section 1401.3.2; change to read as follows: 
1401.3.2 Compliance with other codes. Buildings that are evaluated in accordance with this section shall comply with the International Fire Code. 
(Reason: NCTCOG does not currently review the IPMC for recommended amendments at this time.) 
Chapter 16 - Referenced Standards; change to read as follows:

PROJECTION FACTOR. The ratio of the horizontal depth of the overhang, eave or permanently attached shading device, divided by the distance measured vertically from the bottom of the fenestration glazing to the underside of the overhang, eave or permanently attached shading device. 
(Reason: The amendment to Section 402.3.2 Glazed fenestration SHGC was proposed by the TAB and ESL determined the proposal to be not less restrictive than the 2009, 2012 and 2015 IECC. This added definition is necessary as part of that amendment. The amendment will provide additional options for SHGC selection.) 
Section R202; add the following definition: 
DYNAMIC GLAZING. Any fenestration product that has the fully reversible ability to change it performance properties, including U-factor, solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), or visible transmittance (VT). 
(Reason: This term is referenced in Section R402.3.2. This definition of DYNAMIC GLAZING is also found in the Commercial provisions of the code.) 
Table R402.1.2 INSULATION AND FENESTRATION REQUIREMENTS BY COMPONENT; Amend by changing the WOOD FRAME WALL R-VALUE for CLIMATE ZONE 3 to read as follows: 
13 
(Reason: Retain the values in the 2009 code.) 
NOTE: Effective September 1, 2016 this proposed amendment is deemed less stringent than the residential provisions of the 2015 IECC and therefore would not be considered a recommended amendment. 
Table R402.1.4 EQUIVALENT U-FACTORS; Amend by changing the WOOD FRAME WALL U-FACTOR for CLIMATE ZONE 3 to read as follows: 
0.082 
(Reason: Retain the values in the 2009 code.) 
NOTE: Effective September 1, 2016 this proposed amendment is deemed less stringent than the residential provisions of the 2015 IECC and therefore would not be considered a recommended amendment. 
Section R402.3.2 Glazed fenestration SHGC; amend by adding a paragraph and table following the exception to read as follows: 
Where vertical fenestration is shaded by an overhang, eave, or permanently attached shading device, the SHGC required in Table R402.1.2 shall be reduced by using the multipliers in Table R402.3.2 SHGC Multipliers for Permanent Projections. 
Table R402.3.2 SHGC Multipliers for Permanent Projections a 
Projection

a North oriented means within 45 degrees of true north. 
(Reason: The amendment to Section 402.3.2 Glazed fenestration SHGC was proposed by the TAB and ESL determined the proposal to be not less restrictive than the 2009 and 2015 IECC. This added definition is necessary as part of that amendment. The amendment will provide additional options for SHGC selection.) 
Section R402.4.1.2 Testing; modify the first paragraph to read as follows: 
R402.4.1.2 Testing. The building or dwelling unit shall be tested and verified as having an air leakage rate of not exceeding 5 air changes per hour in Climate Zone 3. {Remainder of text unchanged} 
(Reason: The 2015 IECC requires mandatory door blower testing on each dwelling unit. The visual inspection is no longer an option to performance testing. This change will give some additional time for those builders not currently using a performance approach to adapt construction practices.) 
NOTE: Effective September 1, 2016 this proposed amendment is deemed less stringent than the residential provisions of the 2015 IECC and therefore would not be considered a recommended amendment. 
R402.4.1.2 Testing; Add a last paragraph to read as follows: 
Mandatory testing shall only be performed by individuals that are certified to perform air infiltration testing certified by national or state organizations as approved by the building official. The certified individuals must be an independent third-party entity, and may not be employed; or have any financial interest in the company that constructs the structure. 
(Reason: The 2012/15 International Residential Code (IRC) and International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) includes enhanced emphasis on envelope infiltration and duct leakage. Significant changes in the residential energy requirements include more frequent requirement of performance testing for leakage. Residential Duct systems must be tested unless all ducts and equipment are located within the conditioned space. Envelope testing is required to demonstrate compliance with maximum allowable leakage rate. This language puts the regulatory authority on notice that the testing requires specialized credentials and establishes a conflict of interest baseline). 
R403.3.3 Duct Testing (Mandatory) Add a last paragraph to read as follows: 
Mandatory testing shall only be performed by individuals that are certified to perform duct testing leakage testing certified by national or state organizations as approved by the building official. The certified individuals must be an independent third-party entity, and may not be employed; or have any financial interest in the company that constructs the structure. 
(Reason: The 2015 International Residential Code (IRC) and International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) includes enhanced emphasis on envelope infiltration and duct leakage. Significant changes in the residential energy requirements include more frequent requirement of performance testing for leakage. Residential Duct systems must be tested unless all ducts and equipment are located within the conditioned space. Envelope testing is required to demonstrate compliance with maximum allowable leakage rate. This language puts the regulatory authority on notice that the testing requires specialized credentials and establishes a conflict of interest baseline). 
Section C402.2.7/R402.2; Add Section C402.2.9 and R402.2.14 to read as follows: 
Section C402.2.7/R402.2.14 Insulation installed in walls. To insure that insulation remains in place, insulation installed in walls shall be totally enclosed on all sides consisting of framing lumber, gypsum, sheathing, wood structural panel sheathing, netting or other equivalent material approved by the building official. 
(Reason: This will increase the performance of the insulation by ensuring that the insulation stays in place.) 
Section R405.6.2; add the following sentence to the end of paragraph: 
Acceptable performance software simulation tools may include, but are not limited to, REM Rate TM , Energy Gauge and IC3. Other performance software programs accredited by RESNET BESTEST and having the ability to provide a report as outlined in R405.4.2 may also be deemed acceptable performance simulation programs and may be considered by the building official. 
(Reason: These performance software tools are accredited by RESNET at the time of recommendation.) 
TABLE R406.4 MAXIMUM ENERGY RATING INDEX; amend to read as follows: 
TABLE R406.4 1 
MAXIMUM ENERGY RATING INDEX

Sec. 22-421. - Adoption of the International Residential Code. 
    The International Residential Code, copyrighted by the International Code Council, Inc., save and except the amendments set forth in Exhibit "A", attached hereto and incorporated herein for all purposes, is hereby adopted as the One and Two Family Building Code for Wylie, prescribing regulations applicable to all residential and existing premises structures and constitutes minimum requirements and standards for residential and existing premises construction applications (the "2015 International Residential Code"). The 2015 International Residential Code is made a part of this Ordinance as if fully set forth herein. One (1) copy of the 2015 International Residential Code is on file in the office of the City Secretary of Wylie being marked and designated as the 2015 International Residential Code. 
(Ord. No. 2017-39 , §§ 2, 3, 12-12-2017) 
Sec. 22-422. - Amendments to the International Residential Code. 
    The following sections, paragraphs, and sentences of the 2015 International Residential Code are hereby amended as follows: 
Section R102.4; change to read as follows: 
R102.4 Referenced codes and standards. The codes, when specifically adopted, and standards referenced in this code shall be considered part of the requirements of this code to the prescribed extent of each such reference and as further regulated in Sections R102.4.1 and R102.4.2. Whenever amendments have been adopted to the referenced codes and standards, each reference to said code and standard shall be considered to reference the amendments as well. Any reference made to NFPA 70 or the Electrical Code shall mean the Electrical Code as adopted. 
(Reason: Legal wording to recognize locally adopted codes and amendments adopted with referenced codes. Note: the former ICC Electrical Code is now Appendix K of the IBC, but no longer called by that name. If adopting in that location, be sure to include language that includes structures under IRC and IBC.) 
Section R104.10.1 Flood Hazard areas; delete this section. 
(Reason: Flood hazard ordinances may be administered by other departments within the city.) 
Section R105.3.1.1 & R106.1.4; delete these sections. 
(Reason: Floodplain provisions are addressed locally.) 
Section R110 (R110.1 through R110.5); delete the section. 
(Reason: Issuing CO's for residences is not a common practice in the area.) 
Section R202; change definition of "Townhouse" to read as follows: 
TOWNHOUSE. A single-family dwelling unit constructed in a group of three or more attached units separated by property lines in which each unit extends from foundation to roof and with a yard or public way on at least two sides. 
(Reason: To distinguish Townhouses on separate lots.)

Section R302.1; add exception #6 to read as follows: 
Exceptions: {previous exceptions unchanged} 
6.  Open non-combustible carport structures may be constructed when also approved within adopted ordinances. 
(Reason: Refers to other ordinances, such as zoning ordinances.) 
Section R302.3; add Exception #3 to read as follows: 
Exceptions: 
1.  {existing text unchanged} 
2.  {existing text unchanged} 
3.  Two-family dwelling units that are also divided by a property line through the structure shall be separated as required for townhouses. 
(Reason: Provide guidance for a common construction method in this area. Correlates with amendment to IRC Section R202 Townhouse definition.) 
Section R302.5.1; change to read as follows: 
R302.5.1 Opening protection. Openings from a private garage directly into a room used for sleeping purposes shall not be permitted. Other openings between the garage and residence shall be equipped with solid wood doors not less than 1? inches (35 mm) in thickness, solid or honeycomb core steel doors not less than 1? inches (35 mm) thick, or 20-minute fire-rated doors. 
(Reason: Absence of data linking self-closing devices to increased safety. Self-closing devices often fail to close the door entirely.) 
Section R303.3, Exception; amend to read as follows: 
Exception: {existing text unchanged} Exhaust air from the space shall be exhaust out to the outdoors unless the space contains only a water closet, a lavatory, or water closet and a lavatory may be ventilated with an approved mechanical recirculating fan or similar device designed to remove odors from the air. 
(Reason: Consistent with common local practice as recirculating fans are recognized as acceptable air movement.) 
Section R313 Automatic Fire Sprinkler Systems. Delete subsections in their entirety. 
(Reason: In 2009, the State Legislature enacted SB 1410 prohibiting cities from enacting fire sprinkler mandates in residential dwellings. However, jurisdictions with ordinances that required sprinklers for residential dwellings prior to and enforced before January 1, 2009, may remain in place.) 
Section R315.2.2 Alterations, repairs and additions. Amend to read as follows: 
Exception: 
2.  Installation, alteration or repairs of electrical powered. {remaining text unchanged} 
(Reason: Code intent is to protect against the products of combustion.) 
Section R322 Flood Resistant Construction. Deleted Section. 
(Reason: Floodplain hazard ordinances may be administered by other departments within the city.) 
Section R326 Swimming Pools, Spas and Hot Tubs. Amended to read as follows: 
R326.1 General. The design and construction of pools and spas shall comply with the 2015 IRC Appendix Q. Swimming Pools, Spas and Hot Tubs. 
(Reason: New Pool and Spa code not under review. In lieu of adoption of new pool code, previous edition of 2012 Appendix G is proposed for continued use but renamed 2015 Appendix Q.) 
Section R401.2, amended by adding a new paragraph following the existing paragraph to read as follows. 
Section R401.2. Requirements. {existing text unchanged} ... 
Every foundation and/or footing, or any size addition to an existing post-tension foundation, regulated by this code shall be designed and sealed by a Texas-registered engineer. 
(Amendment to 2012 IRC carried forward to 2015 IRC.) 
Section R602.6.1; amend the following: 
R602.6.1 Drilling and notching of top plate. When piping or ductwork is placed in or partly in an exterior wall or interior load-bearing wall, necessitating cutting, drilling or notching of the top plate by more than 50 percent of its width, a galvanized metal tie not less than 0.054 inch thick (1.37 mm) (16 Ga) and 5 inches (127 mm) wide shall be fastened across and to the plate at each side of the opening with not less than eight 10d (0.148 inch diameter) having a minimum length of 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) at each side or equivalent. Fasteners will be offset to prevent splitting of the top plate material. The metal tie must extend a minimum of 6 inches past the opening. See figure R602.6.1. {remainder unchanged} 
(Amendment to 2012 IRC carried forward to 2015 IRC.) 
Figure R602.6.1; delete the figure and insert the following figure: 

(Amendment to 2012 IRC carried forward to 2015 IRC also provides additional assurance of maintaining the integrity of the framing by spreading the nailing pattern.) 
Section R703.8.4.1; add a second paragraph to read as follows: 
In stud framed exterior walls, all ties shall be anchored to studs as follows: 
1.  When studs are 16 in (407 mm) o.c., stud ties shall be spaced no further apart than 24 in (737 mm) vertically starting approximately 12 in (381 mm) from the foundation; or 
2.  When studs are 24 in (610 mm) o.c., stud ties shall be spaced no further apart than 16 in (483 mm) vertically starting approximately 8 in (254 mm) from the foundation. 
(Reason: (Amendment to 2012 IRC carried forward to 2015 IRC. Provide easy to install and inspect dimensions to clarify how to anchor and to distinguish "studs" from other types of construction.) 
Section R902.1; Amend and add exception #3 to read as follows: 
R902.1 Roofing covering materials. Roofs shall be covered with materials as set forth in Sections R904 and R905. Class A, B, or C roofing shall be installed. {remainder unchanged} 
Exceptions: 
1.  {text unchanged} 
2.  {text unchanged} 
3.  {text unchanged} 
4.  {text unchanged} 
5.  Non-classified roof coverings shall be permitted on one-story detached accessory structures used as tool and storage sheds, playhouses and similar uses, provided the floor area does not exceed (area defined by jurisdiction). 
(Reason: to address accessory structures Group U exempt from permits per Section R105.2) 
Chapter 11 [RE] - Energy Efficiency is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
N1101.1 Scope. This chapter regulates the energy efficiency for the design and construction of buildings regulated by this code. 
N1101.2 Compliance. Compliance shall be demonstrated by meeting the requirements of the residential provisions of 2015 International Energy Conservation Code. 
(Reason: The text of the residential provisions of the 2015 IRC is extracted from the 2015 edition of the International Energy Conservation Code-Residential Provisions and has been editorially revised to conform to the scope and application of this code. The section numbers appearing in parenthesis after each section number are the section numbers of the corresponding text in the International Energy Conservation Code-Residential Provisions. This approach simply minimizes the number of amendments to the IRC) 
Section M1305.1.3; change to read as follows: 
M1305.1.3 Appliances in attics. Attics containing appliances shall be provided ... {bulk of paragraph unchanged} ... sides of the appliance where access is required. The clear access opening dimensions shall be a minimum of 20 inches by 30 inches (508 mm by 762 mm), or larger and large enough to allow removal of the largest appliance. A walkway to an appliance shall be rated as a floor as approved by the building official. As a minimum, for access to the attic space, provide one of the following: 
1.  A permanent stair. 
2.  A pull down stair with a minimum 300 lb (136 kg) capacity. 
3.  An access door from an upper floor level. 
Exceptions: 
1.  The passageway and level service space are not required where the appliance can be serviced and removed through the required opening. 
2.  Where the passageway is unobstructed ...{remaining text unchanged} 
(Reason: To provide a safe means of accessibility to appliances in attics and to allow for different types of construction limitations. Consistent with regional amendment to IFGC and IMC 306.3.) 
Section M1411.3; change to read as follows: 
M1411.3 Condensate disposal. Condensate from all cooling coils or evaporators shall be conveyed from the drain pan outlet to a sanitary sewer through a trap, by means of a direct or indirect drain. Each cooling coil condensate drain shall run separately to the point of disposal and may not be interconnected to other condensate drains. {remaining text unchanged} 
(Reason: Reflects regional practice and to reduce excessive runoff into storm drains.) 
Section M1411.3.1, Items 3 and 4; add text to read as follows: 
M1411.3.1 Auxiliary and secondary drain systems. {bulk of paragraph unchanged} 
1.  {text unchanged} 
2.  {text unchanged} 
3.  An auxiliary drain pan ... {bulk of text unchanged}... with Item 1 of this section. A water level detection device may be installed only with prior approval of the building official. 
4.  A water level detection device ... {bulk of text unchanged}... overflow rim of such pan. A water level detection device may be installed only with prior approval of the building official. 
(Reason: Reflects standard practice in this area.) 
Section M1411.3.1.1; add text to read as follows: 
M1411.3.1.1 Water-level monitoring devices. On down-flow units ...{bulk of text unchanged}... installed in the drain line. A water level detection device may be installed only with prior approval of the building official. 
(Reason: Reflects standard practice in this area.) 
M1503.4 Makeup Air Required Amend and add exception as follows: 
M1503.4 Makeup air required. Exhaust hood systems capable of exhausting in excess of 400 cubic feet per minute (0.19 m3/s) shall be provided with makeup air at a rate approximately equal to the difference between the exhaust air rate and 400 cubic feet per minute. Such makeup air systems shall be equipped with a means of closure and shall be automatically controlled to start and operate simultaneously with the exhaust system. 
Exception: Where all appliances in the house are of sealed combustion, power-vent, unvented, or electric, the exhaust hood system shall be permitted to exhaust up to 600 cubic feet per minute (0.28 m3/s) without providing makeup air. Exhaust hood systems capable of exhausting in excess of 600 cubic feet per minute (0.28 m3/s) shall be provided with a makeup air at a rate approximately equal to the difference between the exhaust air rate and 600 cubic feet per minute. 
(Reason: Exception requires makeup air equaling the amount above and beyond 400 cfm for larger fan which will address concerns related to "fresh" air from the outdoors in hot humid climates creating a burden on HVAC equipment and negative efficiency impacts from back-drafting and wasted energy. 
Section M2005.2; change to read as follows: 
M2005.2 Prohibited locations. Fuel-fired water heaters shall not be installed in a room used as a storage closet. Water heaters located in a bedroom or bathroom shall be installed in a sealed enclosure so that combustion air will not be taken from the living space. Access to such enclosure may be from the bedroom or bathroom when through a solid door, weather-stripped in accordance with the exterior door air leakage requirements of the International Energy Conservation Code and equipped with an approved self-closing device. Installation of direct-vent water heaters within an enclosure is not required. 
(Reason: Corresponds with the provisions of IFGC Section 303, exception #5.) 
Section G2415.2.1 (404.2.1); add a second paragraph to read as follows: 
Both ends of each section of medium pressure gas piping shall identify its operating gas pressure with an approved tag. The tags are to be composed of aluminum or stainless steel and the following wording shall be stamped into the tag: 
"WARNING: 1/2 to 5 psi gas pressure - Do Not Remove" 
(Reason: To protect homeowners and plumbers.) 
Section G2415.2.2 (404.2.2); add an exception to read as follows: 
Exception: Corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST) shall be a minimum of 1/2" (18 EDH). 
(Reason: Pipe less than 1/2" has a history in this region of causing whistling.) 
Section G2415.12 (404.12); change to read as follows: 
G2415.12 (404.12) Minimum burial depth. Underground piping systems shall be installed a minimum depth of 18 inches (457 mm) below grade. 
(Reason: To provide increased protection to piping systems.) 
Section G2417.1 (406.1); change to read as follows: 
G2417.1 (406.1) General. Prior to acceptance and initial operation, all piping installations shall be inspected and pressure tested to determine that the materials, design, fabrication, and installation practices comply with the requirements of this code. The permit holder shall make the applicable tests prescribed in Sections 2417.1.1 through 2417.1.5 to determine compliance with the provisions of this code. The permit holder shall give reasonable advance notice to the building official when the piping system is ready for testing. The equipment, material, power and labor necessary for the inspections and test shall be furnished by the permit holder and the permit holder shall be responsible for determining that the work will withstand the test pressure prescribed in the following tests. 
(Reason: To utilize language used in the IPC regarding who is responsible for testing procedures.) 
Section G2417.4; change to read as follows: 
G2417.4 (406.4) Test pressure measurement. Test pressure shall be measured with a monometer or with a pressure-measuring device designed and calibrated to read, record, or indicate a pressure loss caused by leakage during the pressure test period. The source of pressure shall be isolated before the pressure tests are made. 
(Reason: To require the use of more accurate diaphragm gauges. Spring gauges do not provide accurate measurement below approximately 17 psig.) 
Section G2417.4.1; change to read as follows: 
G2417.4.1 (406.4.1) Test pressure. The test pressure to be used shall be no less than 3 psig (20 kPa gauge), or at the discretion of the Code Official, the piping and valves may be tested at a pressure of at least six (6) inches (152 mm) of mercury, measured with a manometer or slope gauge. 
For tests requiring a pressure of 3 psig, diaphragm gauges shall utilize a dial with a minimum diameter of three and one half inches (3 1/2"), a set hand, 1/10 pound incrementation and pressure range not to exceed 6 psi for tests requiring a pressure of 3 psig. For tests requiring a pressure of 10 psig, diaphragm gauges shall utilize a dial with a minimum diameter of three and one-half inches (3 1/2"), a set hand, a minimum of 2/10 pound incrementation and a pressure range not to exceed 20 psi. For welded piping, and for piping carrying gas at pressures in excess of fourteen (14) inches water column pressure (3.48 kPa) (1/2 psi) and less than 200 inches of water column pressure (52.2 kPa) (7.5 psi), the test pressure shall not be less than ten (10) pounds per square inch (69.6 kPa). For piping carrying gas at a pressure that exceeds 200 inches of water column (52.2 kPa) (7.5 psi), the test pressure shall be not less than one and one-half times the proposed maximum working pressure. 
Diaphragm gauges used for testing must display a current calibration and be in good working condition. The appropriate test must be applied to the diaphragm gauge used for testing. 
(Reason: To provide for lesser pressures to coordinate with the use of more accurate diaphragm gauges.) 
Section G2417.4.2; change to read as follows: 
G2417.4.2 (406.4.2) Test duration. The test duration shall be held for a length of time satisfactory to the Building Official, but in no case for less than fifteen (15) minutes. For welded piping, and for piping carrying gas at pressures in excess of fourteen (14) inches water column pressure (3.48 kPa), the test duration shall be held for a length of time satisfactory to the Building Official, but in no case for less than thirty (30) minutes. 
(Reason: To comply with accepted regional practices.) 
Section G2420.1 (406.1); add Section G2420.1.4 to read as follows: 
G2420.1.4 Valves in CSST installations. Shutoff valves installed with corrugated stainless steel (CSST) piping systems shall be supported with an approved termination fitting, or equivalent support, suitable for the size of the valves, of adequate strength and quality, and located at intervals so as to prevent or damp out excessive vibration but in no case greater than 12-inches from the center of the valve. Supports shall be installed so as not to interfere with the free expansion and contraction of the system's piping, fittings, and valves between anchors. All valves and supports shall be designed and installed so they will not be disengaged by movement of the supporting piping. 
(Reason: To provide proper security to CSST valves. These standards were established in this region in 1999 when CSST was an emerging technology.) 
Section G2420.5.1 (409.5.1); add text to read as follows: 
G2420.5.1 (409.5.1) Located within the same room. The shutoff valve ...{bulk of paragraph unchanged}... in accordance with the appliance manufacturer's instructions. A secondary shutoff valve must be installed within 3 feet (914 mm) of the firebox if appliance shutoff is located in the firebox. 
(Reason: Reflects regional practice and provides an additional measure of safety.) 
Section G2421.1 (410.1); add text and Exception to read as follows: 
G2421.1 (410.1) Pressure regulators. A line pressure regulator shall be ... {bulk of paragraph unchanged}... approved for outdoor installation. Access to regulators shall comply with the requirements for access to appliances as specified in Section M1305. 
Exception: A passageway or level service space is not required when the regulator is capable of being serviced and removed through the required attic opening. 
(Reason: To require adequate access to regulators.) 
Section G2445.2 (621.2); add Exception to read as follows: 
G2445.2 (621.2) Prohibited use. One or more unvented room heaters shall not be used as the sole source of comfort heating in a dwelling unit. 
Exception: Existing approved unvented room heaters may continue to be used in dwelling units, in accordance with the code provisions in effect when installed, when approved by the Building Official unless an unsafe condition is determined to exist as described in International Fuel Gas Code Section 108.7 of the Fuel Gas Code. 
(Reason: Gives code official discretion.) 
Section G2448.1.1 (624.1.1); change to read as follows: 
G2448.1.1 (624.1.1) Installation requirements. The requirements for water heaters relative to access, sizing, relief valves, drain pans and scald protection shall be in accordance with this code. 
(Reason: To clarify installation requirements. Also corresponds with amendments regarding water heater access.) 
Section P2801.6.1; change to read as follows: 
Section P2801.6.1 Pan size and drain.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-44 , § 2, 3 (Exh. A), adopted Dec. 9, 2014, repealed former Art. XX, §§ 22-441-22-450, and enacted a new Art. XX as set out herein. The former Art. XX pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2009-21, §§ 2, 3 (Exh. A), adopted Aug. 11, 2009 and Ord. No. 2014-02, § 2, adopted Jan. 14, 2014. 

Sec. 22-441. - Intent. 
(a)  Signs are an important component of the urban built environment, providing important information, and directions to community residents and visitors. However: 
(1)  The uncontrolled proliferation of signs are hazardous to users of streets and highways within the City of Wylie and will adversely affect the safety and efficiency of the city's transportation network; and 
(2)  Unless the location, number, setback, lighting, and size of signs are regulated, the scattering of the signs throughout the city would be detrimental to the preservation of scenic resources and so to the economic base of the city; and 
(3)  The proliferation of signs in the city has an adverse effect on adjacent property values; and 
(4)  The orderly and uniform regulation of signs are a substantial factor in guiding the attractive and aesthetic development of properties in accordance with the comprehensive plan and thereby avoiding detrimental impacts of signs on the appearance of the city. 
(b)  Therefore, it is the intent of these regulations: 
(1)  To protect the safety and efficiency of the city's transportation network by reducing the confusion or distraction to motorists and enhancing the motorist's ability to see pedestrians, obstacles, other vehicles, and traffic signs; 
(2)  To preserve, protect, and enhance areas of historical, architectural, cultural, aesthetic, and economic value regardless of whether they are natural or manmade; 
(3)  To protect the value of adjacent and nearby properties, in particular, residentially zoned properties from the impact of lighting, size, height, movement, and location of signs; 
(4)  To enhance the image of the city which is conveyed to tourists and visitors by controlling the location, number, and size of signs; 
(5)  To integrate sign regulations more effectively with other regulations by establishing regulations for setbacks, height, and spacing to allow for lighting, ventilation, and preservation of views in a manner consistent with land uses in the various zoning districts; and 
(6)  To preserve and enhance the appearance of the city and the public interest in aesthetics, and to control and reduce visual clutter and blight.

(Reason: To protect homeowners and plumbers.) 
Section 402.3; add an exception to read as follows: 
Exception: Corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST) shall be a minimum of 1/2" (18 EHD). 
(Reason: Pipe less than 1/2" has a history in this region of causing whistling.) 
Section 404.12; change to read as follows: 
404.12 Minimum burial depth. Underground piping systems shall be installed a minimum depth of 18 inches (458 mm) top of pipe below grade. 
(Reason: To provide increased protection to piping systems and address reference number change.) 
Section 406.1; change to read as follows: 
406.1 General. Prior to acceptance and initial operation, all piping installations shall be inspected and pressure tested to determine that the materials, design, fabrication, and installation practices comply with the requirements of this code. The permit holder shall make the applicable tests prescribed in Sections 406.1.1 through 406.1.5 to determine compliance with the provisions of this code. The permit holder shall give reasonable advance notice to the code official when the piping system is ready for testing. The equipment, material, power and labor necessary for the inspections and test shall be furnished by the permit holder and the permit holder shall be responsible for determining that the work will withstand the test pressure prescribed in the following tests. 
(Reason: To utilize language used in the IPC regarding who is responsible for testing procedures.) 
Section 406.4; change to read as follows: 
406.4 Test pressure measurement. Test pressure shall be measured with a monometer or with a pressure-measuring device designed and calibrated to read, record, or indicate a pressure loss caused by leakage during the pressure test period. The source of pressure shall be isolated before the pressure tests are made. 
(Reason: To require the use of more accurate diaphragm gauges. Spring gauges do not provide accurate measurement below approximately 17 psig.) 
Section 406.4.1; change to read as follows: 
406.4.1 Test pressure. The test pressure to be used shall be no less than 3 psig (20 kPa gauge), or at the discretion of the Code Official, the piping and valves may be tested at a pressure of at least six (6) inches (152 mm) of mercury, measured with a manometer or slope gauge. For tests requiring a pressure of 3 psig, diaphragm gauges shall utilize a dial with a minimum diameter of three and one half inches (31/2"), a set hand, 1/10 pound incrimination and pressure range not to exceed 6 psi for tests requiring a pressure of 3 psig. For tests requiring a pressure of 10 psig, diaphragm gauges shall utilize a dial with a minimum diameter of three and one-half inches (3 1/2"), a set hand, a minimum of 2/10 pound incrimination and a pressure range not to exceed 20 psi. For welded piping, and for piping carrying gas at pressures in excess of fourteen (14) inches water column pressure (3.48 kPa) (1/2 psi) and less than 200 inches of water column pressure (52.2 kPa) (7.5 psi), the test pressure shall not be less than ten (10) pounds per square inch (69.6 kPa). For piping carrying gas at a pressure that exceeds 200 inches of water column (52.2 kPa) (7.5 psi), the test pressure shall be not less than one and one-half times the proposed maximum working pressure. 
Diaphragm gauges used for testing must display a current calibration and be in good working condition. The appropriate test must be applied to the diaphragm gauge used for testing.

Sec. 38-22. - Alarm permit requirements. 
(a)  The owner or person in control of an alarm site commits an offense if he installs an alarm system or possesses an activated alarm system without first obtaining an alarm permit from the chief. A separate permit is required for each alarm site. 
(b)  The application for such alarm permit shall contain the following information: 
(1)  Name, business address, home address, business telephone number and home telephone number of the person who is applying for the permit; and 
(2)  Name, business telephone number, and home telephone number of two persons who are authorized and have agreed to receive notification at any time from responding police or fire personnel to come to the alarm site within 30 minutes after receiving such notification; and 
(3)  Classification of the alarm site as residential, commercial, or banking institution; and 
(4)  Purpose of the alarm (i.e., burglary, robbery, fire or medical assistance, etc., or any combination thereof); and 
(5)  Any other information required by the chief to insure compliance with all provisions of this article. 
(c)  The permit holder shall notify the chief of any change in the information contained in the application within five days of such change. Any failure of the alarm user to update any of the information required to obtain an alarm permit as changes occur shall constitute a violation of this article. 
(d)  If the application complies with all requirements of this section, the chief shall issue a permit. 
(e)  Any false statement of a material nature made by an applicant for the purpose of obtaining a permit shall be grounds for denial of the issuance of the permit, or cancellation of the permit if one has been issued. 
(f)  A permit is not assignable or transferable to another person. 
(g)  The permit required by this section shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of its issuance, unless revoked by the chief under the provisions of this article. The permit shall be renewed annually by the permit holder, provided that the permit holder is not in violation of this article. Failure to renew the permit within 30 days of its expiration will be subject to the issuance of a citation. 
(h)  A nonrefundable monthly fee, as determined by the city, shall be paid for the permit by the applicant for each alarm system. 
(i)  It is the responsibility of each alarm user to obtain an alarm permit before operating their alarm system. If a citizen purchases or occupies a premise that has an alarm system monitored directly by the police/fire department, it is the new owner's/occupant's responsibility to obtain an alarm permit and indicate in writing to continue direct monitoring. If this process is not completed within ten days of taking occupancy of the premises, the new owner/occupant will be mailed a certified letter instructing them to obtain the above permit and indicate in writing if they wish to continue direct alarm monitoring with the department. If the letter is unclaimed by the new owner/occupant and returned to the department, an officer will post the letter on the front door of the residence securely with tape. The officer will fill out an affidavit of fact concerning his actions in this matter. If the new owner/occupant does not respond within ten days after receiving the certified letter, and/or after the letter is posted on the front door of the premises, the alarm system located at the premises will be disconnected from direct alarm monitoring with the city. 
(j)  The alarm permit contains emergency contact information on the alarm user with necessary information about the alarm system. This permit must be obtained before operating an alarm system. If the alarm system is operated without a valid alarm permit and the system is activated resulting in an emergency response, the officer responding to the alarm will issue a citation in the name of the alarm user for "operating a nonpermitted alarm system." If the alarm user is not home at the time of the alarm activation, the citation may be left with any authorized adult person present at the time of the alarm response. If no one is home when the response is made, the officer issuing the citation will keep all copies with him and make several attempts to personally deliver the citation. If the citation is not personally delivered after 72 hours, the officer will have the citation delivered by certified mail to the alarm user. The court date will be set no sooner than 30 days from the date of the certified letter to allow for proper notice. If the certified letter is unclaimed by the alarm user and returned to the police/fire department, it will be returned to the officer who issued the citation to be posted on the front door of the premises. This will be done by posting the letter to the front door of the residence securely with tape. The officer will then fill out an affidavit of fact concerning his actions in this matter.

(b)  In addition to the requirements set forth by the UL or ANSI Standards, as amended, the following additional requirements shall be met for all alarm systems installed and operated in the city: 
(1)  All alarm systems installed on or after the effective date of this ordinance and all alarm systems heretofore installed shall have a standby power supply for the control panel and attached equipment. This secondary source of power shall be installed so that if the main source of power fails, the system shall not cause a nonvalid alarm. All standby power must be capable of operating the system for a minimum of four continuous hours. All new installations shall have rechargeable power supplies installed at the time of the initial installation of the alarm system. 
(2)  All commercial alarm systems that use the telephone line to transmit a fire alarm signal must be equipped with a Digital Alarm Communicator Transmitter (ACT) as described in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 72), as amended. 
(3)  New alarm systems shall be installed in such a manner that the protective circuits shall indicate whether they are closed prior to being turned on. 
(4)  All triggering devices utilized in alarm systems within the city shall be adjusted to the degree reasonably possible to suppress nonvalid indications of fire or intrusion, so that alarms shall not be activated by natural phenomena, including but not limited to, transient pressure changes in water pipes, short flashes of light, wind noises or exterior pressure change, such as rattling or vibration of windows or sonic booms, and vehicular noise adjacent to the installation. 
(c)  In addition to the aforesaid requirements for alarm systems, those alarm systems which connect directly to the police/fire department for monitoring shall meet or exceed the following standards: 
(1)  All alarm systems which are directly connected to the department shall be installed by a licensed alarm business in accordance with the standard procedures published by the department, as amended. 
(2)  All alarm systems shall have the standby power sources required in subsection (b)(1) above installed and operational prior to interconnection to the police/fire department. In the fire alarm condition, local annunciation must be provided until manually reset. In the burglar alarm condition, the panel shall reset after 15 minutes in alarm status, but shall retain all indication of the prior alarm status until the system is manually disarmed. 
(3)  Fire alarm indications, when transmitted directly to the city police/fire department, shall originate from smoke or heat detectors at the alarm site. 
(4)  Levels of communications defined: 
a.  A level one communication is an alarm signal which shall be monitored directly by the city police/fire department. 
b.  A level two communication shall consist of a digital dialing device with redundancy, programmed to transmit alarm signals via the residential telephone line and/or radio transmitter to an alarm monitoring station. 
(d)  A local alarm installed after September 1, 1983, shall be designed and maintained to terminate the audible signal within 15 minutes of activation. A local alarm which sounds for a period in excess of 15 minutes shall constitute prima facie proof that the permit holder has violated this section. 
(e)  A permit holder shall maintain the alarm system in such a manner as to assure proper operation and to minimize false alarm notifications. The alarm user shall assure that all batteries utilized as standby power sources in their alarm systems are tested at least once annually and replaced when found to be defective. 
(f)  The alarm permit holder for an alarm system which causes an alarm notification to be sent directly to the city shall adjust the mechanism so that upon activation the system will not transmit another alarm signal without first being manually reset. 
(g)  A permit holder commits an offense if he allows alarm signals to be reported through a relaying intermediary that is not licensed by the state board of private investigators and private security agencies. 
(h)  A person who relays alarm notifications to the city shall communicate such alarm notifications only in a manner and form designated by the chief. 
(i)  The chief shall maintain a written record of all alarm notifications, including but not limited to, the following:

(1)  The chief, in his sole discretion, may terminate law enforcement responses to a permit holder because of excessive false alarms if the permit holder fails to pay the false alarm fees required by this article. In order to effect termination, the chief must issue written notice to the alarm permit holder that the account is past due on false alarm charges. The notice must specify that law enforcement responses will be terminated if the alarm permit holder does not remit payment or make arrangements for payment within a period of time not less than 30 days from the date of the notice provided herein. In addition, the chief, in his sole discretion, may issue a citation to the permit holder if the permit holder fails to pay the noticed false alarm charges. 
(2)  The chief may set standards for burglar alarm systems to be permitted and may refuse to permit particular systems which in his sole discretion have a history of unreliability. 
(3)  The city may not consider a false burglary alarm to have occurred unless a response is made by the police department within 30 minutes of the alarm notification, and the police department determines, in its sole discretion, from an inspection of the interior or exterior of the premises that the alarm was false. 
(Ord. No. 90-6, §§ 4, 5, 3-27-1990; Ord. No. 2000-01, § 3(D), 1-11-2000; Ord. No. 2014-41 , § 3, 12-9-2014) 
Sec. 38-25. - Revocation of alarm permit.

In the event the appeal is for the revocation of a permit, the filing of an appeal shall allow the permit holder to continue to use the alarm system during the administrative appeal process. If an appeal is not made within such ten day period, the action of the chief is final. 
(2)  The city manager shall serve as hearing officer at an appeal and shall consider evidence by any interested person. The formal rules of evidence do not apply at the appeal hearing.

(Ord. No. 2010-09, § 2, 7-13-2010) 
Sec. 42-116. - Notification of violation. 
    Whenever the director finds that a person has violated a prohibition, or continues to violate, failed to meet a requirement of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the authorized director may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation: 
(1)  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
(2)  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
(3)  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
(4)  The abatement of remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
(5)  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; or 
(6)  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.

Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
    When the director finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or any order issued hereunder, the director may serve upon that person a written notice of violation. Within ten calendar days of the receipt of this notice, the person shall submit to the director: 
(1)  An explanation of the violation; and 
(2)  A plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of reoccurrence thereof, to include specific required actions. 
    If the person denies that any violation occurred and/or contends that no corrective action is necessary, an explanation of the basis of any such denial or contention shall be submitted to the director within ten calendar days of receipt of the notice. 
    Submission of an explanation and/or plan in no way relieves the person of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, prior to issuing a notice of violation. 
    The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance with any provision in this article or any order issued hereunder. Such documents may include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 42-117, 42-118, 42-119, 42-120, and 42-121 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.

Notice shall be served on the person and such notice shall include: 
(1)  The time and place for the hearing; 
(2)  The proposed enforcement action; 
(3)  The reasons for such action; and 
(4)  A request that the person show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. 
    The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the person. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the rights and procedures specified in section 42-122 of this article. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.

Such remedial, abatement, and restoration action may include, but not be limited to: monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of the adverse effects and determination of the appropriate remedial, abatement, and/or restoration action; confinement, removal, cleanup, treatment, and disposal of any discharged or released pollution or contamination; prevention, minimization, and/or mitigation of any damage to the public health, welfare, or the environment that may result from the violation; restoration or replacement of city property or natural resources damaged by the violation. The order may direct that the remediation, abatement, and/or restoration be accomplished on a specified compliance schedule and/or be completed within a specified period of time. An order issued under this section does not relieve the person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of an order under this section shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against any responsible party.

(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements of this article; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this section shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a person's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters in the state, including immediate termination of a site's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The director may allow the person to commence or recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the person. the cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person under this article. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director within ten calendar days of receipt of the emergency cease and desist order.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-41 , §§ 2, 3 (Exh. A), adopted Dec. 12, 2017, repealed and re-enacted Art. III to read as set out herein. Former Art. III, §§ 46-41-46-45, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2013-06, §§ 2-6, adopted Feb. 12, 2013. 

Sec. 46-41. - Adoption of the International Fire Code. 
    The City Council hereby adopts the 2015 Edition of the International Fire Code, copyrighted by the International Code Council, Inc., save and except the deletions and additions set forth in Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated herein for all purposes, and including Appendix D thereto, prescribing regulations governing, among other things, conditions hazardous to life and property from fire, hazardous materials or explosions in Wylie ("2015 International Fire Code"). Where options are provided in Exhibit A, the City Council hereby adopts Option B. The 2015 International Fire Code is made a part of this Ordinance as if fully set forth herein. One (1) copy of the 2015 International Fire Code shall be kept on file in the office of the City Secretary of Wylie being marked and designated as the 2015 International Fire Code. 
(Ord. No. 2017-41 , §§ 2, 3, 12-12-2017) 
Sec. 46-42. - Amendments to the International Fire Code[4] 
    The following deletions and additions of the 2015 International Fire Code are hereby approved and adopted: 
Section 102.1; change #3 to read as follows: 
3.  Existing structures, facilities, and conditions when required in Chapter 11 or in specific sections of this code. 
(Reason: To clarify that there are other provisions in the fire code applicable to existing buildings that are not located in Chapter 11, such as Section 505 Premises Identification.) 
Section 105.3.3; change to read as follows: 
105.3.3 Occupancy Prohibited before Approval. The building or structure shall not be occupied prior to the fire code official issuing a permit when required and conducting associated inspections indicating the applicable provisions of this code have been met. 
(Reason: For clarity to allow for better understanding in areas not requiring such permits, such as unincorporated areas of counties. This amendment may be struck by a city.) 
Section 105.7; add Section 105.7.19 to read as follows: 
105.7.19 Electronic access control systems. Construction permits are required for the installation or modification of an electronic access control system, as specified in Chapter 10. A separate construction permit is required for the installation or modification of a fire alarm system that may be connected to the access control system. Maintenance performed in accordance with this code is not considered a modification and does not require a permit. 
(Reason: Adds construction permit requirements for electronic access control systems affecting access and/or egress to ensure proper design and installation of such systems. These changes reflect local practices of municipalities in this region.) 
[B] AMBULATORY CARE FACILITY. Buildings or portions thereof used to provide medical, surgical, psychiatric, nursing, or similar care on a less than 24-hour basis to persons who are rendered incapable of self-preservation by the services provided. This group may include but not be limited to the following: 
- Dialysis centers 
- Procedures involving sedation 
- Sedation dentistry 
- Surgery centers 
- Colonic centers 
- Psychiatric centers 
(Reason: to clarify the range of uses included in the definition) 
[B] ATRIUM. An opening connecting three or more stories ... {remaining text unchanged} 
(Reason: Accepted practice in the region based on legacy codes. IBC Section 1009 permits unenclosed two story stairways under certain circumstances.) 
[B] DEFEND IN PLACE. A method of emergency response that engages building components and trained staff to provide occupant safety during an emergency. Emergency response involves remaining in place, relocating within the building, or both, without evacuating the building. 
(Reason: Added from International Building Code (IBC) definitions for consistency in interpretation of the subject requirements pertaining to such occupancies.) 
FIRE WATCH. A temporary measure intended to ensure continuous and systematic surveillance of a building or portion thereof, whether occupied or unoccupied, by one or more qualified individuals or standby personnel when required by the fire code official, for the purposes of identifying and controlling fire hazards, detecting early signs of unwanted fire, raising an alarm of fire and notifying the fire department. 
(Reason: Clearly defines options to the fire department for providing a fire watch.) 
FIREWORKS. Any composition or device for the purpose of producing a visible or an audible effect for entertainment purposes by combustion, deflagration, detonation, and/or activated by ignition with a match or other heat producing device that meets the definition of 1.4G fireworks or 1.3G fireworks as set forth herein. ... {remainder of text unchanged}... 
(Reason: Increased safety from fireworks related injuries.) 
HIGH-PILED COMBUSTIBLE STORAGE: add a second paragraph to read as follows: 
Any building classified as a group S Occupancy or Speculative Building exceeding 6,000 sq. ft. that has a clear height in excess of 14 feet, making it possible to be used for storage in excess of 12 feet, shall be considered to be high-piled storage. When a specific product cannot be identified, a fire protection system and life safety features shall be installed as for Class IV commodities, to the maximum pile height. 
(Reason: To provide protection for worst-case scenario in flexible or unknown situations.) 
HIGH-RISE BUILDING. A building with an occupied floor located more than 55 feet (16,764 mm) above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access. 
(Reason: Allows for additional construction safety features to be provided, based on firefighting response capabilities.) 
REPAIR GARAGE. A building, structure or portion thereof used for servicing or repairing motor vehicles. This occupancy shall also include garages involved in minor repair, modification and servicing of motor vehicles for items such as lube changes, inspections, windshield repair or replacement, shocks, minor part replacement, and other such minor repairs. 
(Reason: To further clarify types of service work allowed in a repair garage, as well as to correspond with definition in the IBC.) 
SELF-SERVICE STORAGE FACILITY. Real property designed and used for the purpose of renting or leasing individual storage spaces to customers for the purpose of storing and removing personal property on a self-service basis. 
(Reason: To provide a definition that does not exist in the code.) 
STANDBY PERSONNEL. Qualified fire service personnel, approved by the Fire Chief. When utilized, the number required shall be as directed by the Fire Chief. Charges for utilization shall be as normally calculated by the jurisdiction. 
UPGRADED OR REPLACED FIRE ALARM SYSTEM. A fire alarm system that is upgraded or replaced includes, but is not limited to the following: 
  Replacing one single board or fire alarm control unit component with a newer model 
  Installing a new fire alarm control unit in addition to or in place of an existing one

The following are not considered an upgrade or replacement: 
  Firmware updates 
  Software updates 
  Replacing boards of the same model with chips utilizing the same or newer firmware 
(Reason: This is referenced in several places, but the wording of "upgraded or replaced" is somewhat ambiguous and open to interpretation. Defining it here allows for consistent application across the region.) 
Section 307.1.1; change to read as follows: 
307.1.1 Prohibited Open Burning. Open burning that is offensive or objectionable because of smoke emissions or when atmospheric conditions or local circumstances make such fires hazardous shall be prohibited. 
Exception: {No change.} 
(Reason: To further protect adjacent property owners/occupants from open burning and/or smoke emissions from open burning.) 
Section 307.2; change to read as follows: 
307.2 Permit Required. A permit shall be obtained from the fire code official in accordance with Section 105.6 prior to kindling a fire for recognized silvicultural or range or wildlife management practices, prevention or control of disease or pests, or open burning.

1.  Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) guidelines and/or restrictions. 
2.  State, County, or Local temporary or permanent bans on open burning. 
3.  Local written policies as established by the fire code official. 
(Reason: Amendments to 307.2, 307.4, 307.4.3, and 307.5 better explain current requirements and recognize that jurisdictions have local established policies that best fit their environments.) 
Section 307.3; change to read as follows: 
307.3 Extinguishment Authority. The fire code official is authorized to order the extinguishment by the permit holder, another person responsible or the fire department of open burning that creates or adds to a hazardous or objectionable situation. 
(Reason: Provides direction as to responsible parties relative to extinguishment of the subject open burning.) 
Section 307.4; change to read as follows: 
307.4 Location. The location for open burning shall not be less than 300 feet (91,440 mm) from any structure, and provisions shall be made to prevent the fire from spreading to within 300 feet (91,440 mm) of any structure. 
Exceptions: {No change.} 
(Reason: To increase the separation distance thereby increasing the safety to adjacent properties, as per applicable TCEQ rules and regulations regarding outdoor burning.) 
Section 307.4.3, Exceptions: add exception #2 to read as follows: 
Exceptions: 
2.  Where buildings, balconies and decks are protected by an approved automatic sprinkler system. 
(Reason: To reflect similar allowances for open-flame cooking in these same locations.)

307.4.5 Trench Burns. Trench burns shall be conducted in air curtain trenches and in accordance with Section 307.2. 
(Reason: To provide a greater level of safety for this potentially hazardous fire exposure condition. Decrease in separation distance allowed for outdoor firepits due to permanent nature of construction having substantial securement.) 
Section 307.5; change to read as follows: 
307.5 Attendance. Open burning, trench burns, bonfires, recreational fires, and use of portable outdoor fireplaces shall be constantly attended until the ... {Remainder of section unchanged} 
(Reason: Adds attendance for trench burns based on previous amendment provision for such.) 
Section 308.1.4; change to read as follows: 
308.1.4 Open-flame Cooking Devices. Open-flame cooking devices, charcoal grills and other similar devices used for cooking shall not be located or used on combustible balconies, decks, or within 10 feet (3048 mm) of combustible construction. 
Exceptions: 
1.  One- and two-family dwellings, except that LP-gas containers are limited to a water capacity not greater than 50 pounds (22.68 kg) [nominal 20 pound (9.08 kg) LP-gas capacity] with an aggregate LP-gas capacity not to exceed 100 lbs (5 containers). 
2.  Where buildings, balconies and decks are protected by an approved automatic sprinkler system, except that LP-gas containers are limited to a water capacity not greater than 50 pounds (22.68 kg) [nominal 20 pound (9.08 kg) LP-gas capacity], with an aggregate LP-gas capacity not to exceed 40 lbs (2 containers). 
3.  {No change.} 
(Reason: Decrease fire risk in multi-family dwellings and minimizes ignition sources and clarify allowable limits for 1 & 2 family dwellings, and allow an expansion for sprinklered multi-family uses. This amendment adds clarification and defines the container size allowed for residences.) 
Section 308.1.6.2, Exception #3; change to read as follows: 
Exceptions: 
3.  Torches or flame-producing devices in accordance with Section 308.1.3. 
(Reason: Section identified in published code is inappropriate.) 
Section 308.1.6.3; change to read as follows: 
308.1.6.3 Sky Lanterns. A person shall not release or cause to be released an unmanned free-floating devices containing an open flame or other heat source, such as but not limited to a sky lantern. 
(Reason: Eliminates the potential fire hazard presented by utilization of such devices and the potential accidental release of such devices.) 
Section 311.5; change to read as follows: 
311.5 Placards. The fire code official is authorized to require marking of any vacant or abandoned buildings or structures determined to be unsafe pursuant to Section 110 of this code relating to structural or interior hazards, as required by Section 311.5.1 through 311.5.5. 
(Reason: There may be situations where placarding is not desired or necessary; also clarifies intent that it is not the fire code official's responsibility to provide the placard.) 
{Note that prior amendment to Section 401.9 in the 2012 IFC recommended amendments has been relocated to Section 901.6.3 as a more appropriate location for the requirement.} 
Section 403.5; change Section 403.5 to read as follows: 
403.5 Group E Occupancies. An approved fire safety and evacuation plan in accordance with Section 404 shall be prepared and maintained for Group E occupancies and for buildings containing both a Group E occupancy and an atrium. A diagram depicting two evacuation routes shall be posted in a conspicuous location in each classroom. Group E occupancies shall also comply with Sections 403.5.1 through 403.5.3. 
(Reason: The diagrams are intended to assist with egress in such occupancies - specifically, the primary teacher is not always present to assist children with egress. Also, such will help reinforce evacuation drill requirements.) 
Section 404.2.2; add Number 4.10 to read as follows: 
4.10 Fire extinguishing system controls. 
(Reason: The committee believed this information could be of great help to such plans to facilitate locating sprinkler valves to minimize water damage, for instance.) 
Section 405.4; change Section 405.4 to read as follows: 
405.4 Time. The fire code official may require an evacuation drill at any time. Drills shall be held at unexpected times and under varying conditions to simulate the unusual conditions that occur in case of fire. 
(Reason: This change clarifies who may require a fire or evacuation drill). 
Section 501.4; change to read as follows: 
501.4 Timing of Installation. When fire apparatus access roads or a water supply for fire protection is required to be installed for any structure or development, they shall be installed, tested, and approved prior to the time of which construction has progressed beyond completion of the foundation of any structure. 
(Reason: Reflects current practice in the region relative to ensuring fire department and EMS access during construction, which can be a time of increased frequency for emergency incidents.) 
Section 503.1.1; add sentence to read as follows: 
Except for one- or two-family dwellings, the path of measurement shall be along a minimum of a ten feet (10') wide unobstructed pathway around the external walls of the structure. 
(Reason: Recognizes that the hose lay provision can only be measured along a pathway that is wide enough for fire fighter access.) 
Section 503.2.1; change to read as follows: 
503.2.1 Dimensions. Fire apparatus access roads shall have an unobstructed width of not less than 24 feet (7315 mm), exclusive of shoulders, except for approved security gates in accordance with Section 503.6, and an unobstructed vertical clearance of not less than 14 feet (4267 mm). 
Exception: Vertical clearance may be reduced; provided such reduction does not impair access by fire apparatus and approved signs are installed and maintained indicating the established vertical clearance when approved. 
(Reason: Amendments to 503.2.1 and 503.2.2 recognize that the equipment now used in firefighting is increasing in size. The code already recognizes that larger dimensions may be required under Section 503.2.2. The amendments are to standardize the dimensions for this area. With the increase in fire apparatus size, this will allow for the passage of two fire apparatus during a fire or EMS emergency.) 
Section 503.2.2; change to read as follows: 
503.2.2 Authority. The fire code official shall have the authority to require an increase in the minimum access widths and vertical clearances where they are inadequate for fire or rescue operations. 
(Reason: Amendments to 503.2.1 and 503.2.2 recognize that the equipment now used in firefighting is increasing in size. The code already recognizes that larger dimensions may be required under Section 503.2.2. The amendments are to standardize the dimensions for this area. With the increase in fire apparatus size, this will allow for the passage of two fire apparatus during a fire or EMS emergency.) 
Section 503.2.3; change Section 503.2.3 to read as follows: 
503.2.3 Surface. Fire apparatus access roads shall be designed and maintained to support imposed loads of 80,000 Lbs for fire apparatus and shall be surfaced so as to provide all-weather driving capabilities. 
(Reason: To address the current size of fire trucks in use - figure derived from DOT requirements for waiver of vehicle exceeding such weight.) 
Section 503.3; change to read as follows: 
503.3 Marking. Striping, signs, or other markings, when approved by the fire code official, shall be provided for fire apparatus access roads to identify such roads or prohibit the obstruction thereof. Striping, signs and other markings shall be maintained in a clean and legible condition at all times and be replaced or repaired when necessary to provide adequate visibility. 
(1) Striping - Fire apparatus access roads shall be continuously marked by painted lines of red traffic paint six inches (6") in width to show the boundaries of the lane. The words "NO PARKING FIRE LANE" or "FIRE LANE NO PARKING" shall appear in four inch (4") white letters at 25 feet intervals on the red border markings along both sides of the fire lanes. Where a curb is available, the striping shall be on the vertical face of the curb. 
(2) Signs - Signs shall read "NO PARKING FIRE LANE" or "FIRE LANE NO PARKING" and shall be 12" wide and 18" high. Signs shall be painted on a white background with letters and borders in red, using not less than 2" lettering. Signs shall be permanently affixed to a stationary post and the bottom of the sign shall be six feet, six inches (6'6") above finished grade. Signs shall be spaced not more than fifty feet (50') apart along both sides of the fire lane. Signs may be installed on permanent buildings or walls or as approved by the Fire Chief. 
(Reason: Establishes a standard method of marking and reflects local long-standing practices.) 
Section 503.4; change to read as follows: 
503.4 Obstruction of Fire Apparatus Access Roads. Fire apparatus access roads shall not be obstructed in any manner, including the parking of vehicles. The minimum widths and clearances established in Section 503.2.1 and any area marked as a fire lane as described in Section 503.3 shall be maintained at all times. 
(Reason: As originally worded, the section implied that vehicles could be parked in the marked fire lane and not be in violation if the minimum width is still maintained. Current accepted enforcement practice is to require the entire marked fire lane to be maintained clear and unobstructed.) 
Section 505.1; change to read as follows: 
505.1 Address Identification. New and existing buildings shall be provided with approved address identification. The address identification shall be legible and placed in a position that is visible from the street or road fronting the property. Address identification characters shall contrast with their background. Address numbers shall be Arabic numbers or alphabetical letters. Numbers shall not be spelled out. Each character shall be not less than 6 inches (152.4 mm) high with a minimum stroke width of 1/2 inch (12.7 mm). Where required by the fire code official, address numbers shall be provided in additional approved locations to facilitate emergency response. Where access is by means of a private road, buildings do not immediately front a street, and/or the building cannot be viewed from the public way, a monument, pole or other sign with approved 6 inch (152.4 mm) height building numerals or addresses and 4 inch (101.6 mm) height suite/apartment numerals of a color contrasting with the background of the building or other approved means shall be used to identify the structure. Numerals or addresses shall be posted on a minimum 20 inch (508 mm) by 30 inch (762 mm) background on border. Address identification shall be maintained. 
Exception: R-3 Single Family occupancies shall have approved numerals of a minimum 3 1/2 inches (88.9 mm) in height and a color contrasting with the background clearly visible and legible from the street fronting the property and rear alleyway where such alleyway exists. 
(Reason: To increase the minimum addressing requirements for commercial properties and establish a minimum for single-family residential properties Such improves legibility of these signs which are critical to emergency response in a more timely manner.) 
Section 507.4; change to read as follows: 
507.4 Water Supply Test Date and Information. The water supply test used for hydraulic calculation of fire protection systems shall be conducted in accordance with NFPA 291 "Recommended Practice for Fire Flow Testing and Marking of Hydrants" and within one year of sprinkler plan submittal. The fire code official shall be notified prior to the water supply test. Water supply tests shall be witnessed by the fire code official, as required. The exact location of the static/residual hydrant and the flow hydrant shall be indicated on the design drawings. All fire protection plan submittals shall be accompanied by a hard copy of the waterflow test report, or as approved by the fire code official. The report must indicate the dominant water tank level at the time of the test and the maximum and minimum operating levels of the tank, as well, or identify applicable water supply fluctuation. The licensed contractor must then design the fire protection system based on this fluctuation information, as per the applicable referenced NFPA standard. Reference Section 903.3.5 for additional design requirements. 
(Reason: Clarifies intent of the test to ensure contractor accounts for water supply fluctuations.) 
Section 507.5.4; change to read as follows: 
507.5.4 Obstruction. Unobstructed access to fire hydrants shall be maintained at all times. Posts, fences, vehicles, growth, trash, storage and other materials or objects shall not be placed or kept near fire hydrants, fire department inlet connections or fire protection system control valves in a manner that would prevent such equipment or fire hydrants from being immediately discernible. The fire department shall not be deterred or hindered from gaining immediate access to fire protection equipment or fire hydrants. 
(Reason: Maintains wording from 2006 Code to ensure these critical devices are available in an emergency incident.) 
Section 509.1.2; add new Section 509.1.2 to read as follows: 
509.1.2 Sign Requirements. Unless more stringent requirements apply, lettering for signs required by this section shall have a minimum height of 2 inches (50.8 mm) when located inside a building and 4 inches (101.6 mm) when located outside, or as approved by the fire code official. The letters shall be of a color that contrasts with the background. 
(Reason: Provides direction as to appropriate sign criteria to develop consistency in this regard.) 
Section 603.3.2.1, Exception; change exception to read as follows: 
Exception: The aggregate capacity limit shall be permitted to be increased to 3,000 gallons (11,356 L) in accordance with all requirements of Chapter 57. ... {Delete remainder of Exception} 
(Reason: Change to Section 5704.2.9.5 is included in this amendment package.) 
Section 603.3.2.2; change to read as follows: 
603.3.2.2 Restricted Use and Connection. Tanks installed in accordance with Section 603.3.2 shall be used only to supply fuel oil to fuel-burning equipment installed in accordance with Section 603.3.2.4. Connections between tanks and equipment supplied by such tanks shall be made using closed piping systems. 
(Reason: Relocate the exception to Chapter 57 for applicability to generator sets, due to contradictory charging statement in 603.1 to not apply to internal combustion engines. Further, such large quantities of combustible liquid are more thoroughly addressed in Chapter 57 relative to such tanks.) 
Section 604; change and add to read as follows: 
604.1.1 Stationary Generators. Stationary emergency and standby power generators required by this code shall be listed in accordance with UL 2200. 
604.1.2 Installation. Emergency power systems and standby power systems shall be installed in accordance with the International Building Code, NFPA 70, NFPA 110 and NFPA 111. Existing installations shall be maintained in accordance with the original approval, except as specified in Chapter 11. 
604.1.3 through 604.1.8 {No changes to these sections.} 
604.1.9 Critical Operations Power Systems (COPS). For Critical Operations Power Systems necessary to maintain continuous power supply to facilities or parts of facilities that require continuous operation for the reasons of public safety, emergency management, national security, or business continuity, see NFPA 70. 
604.2 Where Required. Emergency and standby power systems shall be provided where required by Sections 604.2.1 through 604.2.24 or elsewhere identified in this code or any other referenced code. 
604.2.1 through 604.2.3 {No change.} 
604.2.4 Emergency Voice/alarm Communications Systems.

604.2.23 Hydrogen Cutoff Rooms. Standby power shall be provided for mechanical ventilation and gas detection systems of Hydrogen Cutoff Rooms in accordance with the International Building Code, Section 421.8. 
604.2.24 Means of Egress Illumination in Existing Buildings. Emergency power shall be provided for means of egress illumination in accordance with Section 1104.5 when required by the fire code official. (90 minutes in I-2, 60 minutes elsewhere.) 
604.3 through 604.7 {No change.} 
604.8 Energy Time Duration. Unless a time limit is specified by the fire code official, in this chapter or elsewhere in this code, or in any other referenced code or standard, the emergency and standby power system shall be supplied with enough fuel or energy storage capacity for not less than 2-hour full-demand operation of the system. 
Exception: Where the system is supplied with natural gas from a utility provider and is approved. 
(Reason: These provisions provide a list to complete and match that throughout the codes. The only new items are the reference to COPS in NFPA 70, and the specified Energy time duration. Other changes are a reference to a code provision that already exists.) 
Section 609.2; change to read as follows: 
609.2 Where Required. A Type I hood shall be installed at or above all commercial cooking appliances and domestic cooking appliances used for commercial purposes that produce grease vapors, including but not limited to cooking equipment used in fixed, mobile, or temporary concessions, such as trucks, buses, trailers, pavilions, or any form of roofed enclosure, as required by the fire code official. 
Exceptions: 
1.  Tents, as provided for in Chapter 31. 
2.  {No change to existing Exception.} 
Additionally, fuel gas and power provided for such cooking appliances shall be interlocked with the extinguishing system, as required by Section 904.12.2. Fuel gas containers and piping/hose shall be properly maintained in good working order and in accordance with all applicable regulations. 
(Reason: To require fire protection and prevention for mobile food trucks and other mobile commercial cooking operations for the protection of occupants and first responders, including the fuel gas utilized for the cooking operation.) 
Section 704.1; change to read as follows: 
704.1 Enclosure. Interior vertical shafts including, but not limited to, stairways, elevator hoistways, service and utility shafts, that connect two or more stories of a building shall be enclosed or protected in accordance with the codes in effect at the time of construction but, regardless of when constructed, not less than as required in Chapter 11. New floor openings in existing buildings shall comply with the International Building Code. 
(Reason: Provides standard minimum protection retroactively, but clarifies that this section is not to be used to reduce higher protection levels that were required when originally constructed.) 
Section 807.3; change to read as follows: 
807.3 Combustible Decorative Materials. In occupancies in Groups A, E, I, and R-1, and dormitories in Group R-2, curtains, draperies, fabric hangings and other similar combustible decorative materials suspended from walls or ceilings shall comply with Section 807.4 and shall not exceed 10 percent of the specific wall or ceiling area to which they are attached. 
(Reason: Section 807 was re-arranged and modified from the 2012 IFC: previously, curtains were required to be NFPA 701 compliant and limited to 10 percent of the applicable wall in A, E, I, R-1, and R-2 dormitory occupancies, but now, per the published 2015 IFC, Section 807.3 would apply to all occupancies, except I-3 (non-combustible only). Such a change is a tremendous expansion of the requirement, and no justification was provided in the proposed code change at the code hearings as to the reasons for such an expansion of the requirement, especially considering that it also applies to existing buildings. The board believes that this change is an over-reach for such a stringent requirement and that maintenance of the legacy language is appropriate at this time.) 
Section 807.5.2.2 and 807.5.2.3; change to read as follows: 
807.5.2.2 Artwork in Corridors. Artwork and teaching materials shall be limited on the walls of corridors to not more than 20 percent of the wall area. Such materials shall not be continuous from floor to ceiling or wall to wall. Curtains, draperies, wall hangings, and other decorative material suspended from the walls or ceilings shall meet the flame propagation performance criteria of NFPA 701 in accordance with Section 807 or be noncombustible. 
Exception: Corridors protected by an approved automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 shall be limited to 50 percent of the wall area. 
807.5.2.3 Artwork in Classrooms. Artwork and teaching materials shall be limited on walls of classrooms to not more than 50 percent of the specific wall area to which they are attached. 
Curtains, draperies, wall hangings and other decorative material suspended from the walls or ceilings shall meet the flame propagation performance criteria of NFPA 701 in accordance with Section 807 or be noncombustible. 
(Reason: This change allows an increase in wall coverage due to the presence of sprinklers. Also provides additional guidance relative to fire resistance requirements in these areas.) 
Section 807.5.5.2 and 807.5.5.3; change to read as follows: 
807.5.5.2 Artwork in Corridors. Artwork and teaching materials shall be limited on the walls of corridors to not more than 20 percent of the wall area. Such materials shall not be continuous from floor to ceiling or wall to wall. Curtains, draperies, wall hangings and other decorative material suspended from the walls or ceilings shall meet the flame propagation performance criteria of NFPA 701 in accordance with Section 807 or be noncombustible. 
Exception: Corridors protected by an approved automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 shall be limited to 50 percent of the wall area. 
807.5.5.3 Artwork in Classrooms. Artwork and teaching materials shall be limited on walls of classrooms to not more than 50 percent of the specific wall area to which they are attached. Curtains, draperies, wall hangings and other decorative material suspended from the walls or ceilings shall meet the flame propagation performance criteria of NFPA 701 in accordance with Section 807 or be noncombustible. 
(Reason: This change allows an increase in wall coverage due to the presence of sprinklers. Also provides additional guidance relative to fire resistance requirements in these areas.) 
Section 901.6.1; add Section 901.6.1.1 to read as follows: 
901.6.1.1 Standpipe Testing. Building owners/managers must maintain and test standpipe systems as per NFPA 25 requirements. The following additional requirements shall be applied to the testing that is required every 5 years: 
1.  The piping between the Fire Department Connection (FDC) and the standpipe shall be backflushed when foreign material is present, and also hydrostatically tested for all FDCs on any type of standpipe system. Hydrostatic testing shall also be conducted in accordance with NFPA 25 requirements for the different types of standpipe systems. 
2.  For any manual (dry or wet) standpipe system not having an automatic water supply capable of flowing water through the standpipe, the tester shall connect hose from a fire hydrant or portable pumping system (as approved by the fire code official) to each FDC, and flow water through the standpipe system to the roof outlet to verify that each inlet connection functions properly. Confirm that there are no open hose valves prior to introducing water into a dry standpipe. There is no required pressure criteria at the outlet. Verify that check valves function properly and that there are no closed control valves on the system. 
3.  Any pressure relief, reducing, or control valves shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of NFPA 25. All hose valves shall be exercised. 
4.  If the FDC is not already provided with approved caps, the contractor shall install such caps for all FDCs as required by the fire code official. 
5.  Upon successful completion of standpipe test, place a blue tag (as per Texas Administrative Code, Fire Sprinkler Rules for Inspection, Test and Maintenance Service (ITM) Tag) at the bottom of each standpipe riser in the building. The tag shall be check-marked as "Fifth Year" for Type of ITM, and the note on the back of the tag shall read "5 Year Standpipe Test" at a minimum. 
6.  The procedures required by Texas Administrative Code Fire Sprinkler Rules with regard to Yellow Tags and Red Tags or any deficiencies noted during the testing, including the required notification of the local Authority Having Jurisdiction (fire code official) shall be followed. 
7.  Additionally, records of the testing shall be maintained by the owner and contractor, if applicable, as required by the State Rules mentioned above and NFPA 25. 
8.  Standpipe system tests where water will be flowed external to the building shall not be conducted during freezing conditions or during the day prior to expected night time freezing conditions. 
9.  Contact the fire code official for requests to remove existing fire hose from Class II and III standpipe systems where employees are not trained in the utilization of this firefighting equipment. All standpipe hose valves must remain in place and be provided with an approved cap and chain when approval is given to remove hose by the fire code official. 
(Reason: Increases the reliability of the fire protection system and re-emphasizes the requirements of NFPA 25 relative to standpipe systems, as well as ensuring that FDC connections are similarly tested/maintained to ensure operation in an emergency incident.) 
Section 901.6.3; add Section 901.6.3 to read as follows: 
901.6.3 False Alarms and Nuisance Alarms. False alarms and nuisance alarms shall not be given, signaled or transmitted or caused or permitted to be given, signaled or transmitted in any manner. 
(Reason: Places the responsibility on the business or property owner to maintain their fire alarm systems in approved condition. Allows the enforcement of "prohibition of false alarms". Replaces text lost from the legacy codes that helps to ensure the maintenance of life safety systems.) 
Section 901.7; change to read as follows: 
901.7 Systems Out of Service. Where a required fire protection system is out of service or in the event of an excessive number of activations, the fire department and the fire code official shall be notified immediately and, where required by the fire code official, the building shall either be evacuated or an approved fire watch shall be provided for all occupants and/or portions of the building left unprotected by the shut down until the fire protection system has been returned to service. Where required by the fire code official, the building owner or impairment coordinator shall appear at the building where the required fire protection system is out of service and be present during any period in which a fire watch is in place, unless otherwise directed by the fire code official. ... {remaining text unchanged} 
(Reason: Gives fire code official more discretion with regards to enforcement of facilities experiencing nuisance alarm or fire protection system activations necessitating correction/repair/replacement. The intent of the amendment is to allow local jurisdictions to enforce fire watches, etc., where needed to ensure safety of occupants and buildings where fire protection systems are experiencing multiple nuisance activations. 
Section 901.8.2; change to read as follows: 
901.8.2 Removal of Occupant-use Hose Lines. The fire code official is authorized to permit the removal of occupant-use hose lines and hose valves where all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  [Delete.] 
2.  The hose line(s) would not be utilized by trained personnel or the fire department. 
3.  If the occupant-use hose lines are removed, but the hose valves are required to remain as per the fire code official, such shall be compatible with local fire department fittings. 
(Reason: Occupant-use hose lines have been an issue of concern that fire code officials have struggled with for many years now, primarily in that they are required by the published code, even though occupants are rarely properly trained in their use or provided with the OSHA-required protective gear for such use, such as with an industrial fire brigade. The allowance for these hose lines to remain only promotes the possibility of an occupant attempting to fight fire for an unknown duration, rather than evacuate, and potentially injure themselves or others through such action. They present greater risk than benefit to the occupants, and as such, the above gives the fire code official the authorization to allow removal of such at his or her discretion.) 
Section 903.1.1; change to read as follows: 
903.1.1 Alternative Protection. Alternative automatic fire-extinguishing systems complying with Section 904 shall be permitted in addition to automatic sprinkler protection where recognized by the applicable standard, or as approved by the fire code official. 
(Reason: Such alternative systems do not provide the reliability of automatic sprinkler protection. Most gaseous type systems are highly susceptible to open doors, ceiling or floor tile removal, etc. However, an applicant could pursue an Alternate Method request to help mitigate the reliability issues with these alternative systems with the fire code official if so desired, or there may be circumstances in which the fire code official is acceptable to allowing an alternate system in lieu of sprinklers, such as kitchen hoods or paint booths.) 
Section 903.2; add paragraph to read as follows: 
Automatic Sprinklers shall not be installed in elevator machine rooms, elevator machine spaces, and elevator hoistways, other than pits where such sprinklers would not necessitate shunt trip requirements under any circumstances. Storage shall not be allowed within the elevator machine room. Signage shall be provided at the entry doors to the elevator machine room indicating "ELEVATOR MACHINERY - NO STORAGE ALLOWED." 
(Reason: Firefighter and public safety. This amendment eliminates the shunt trip requirement of the International Building Code Section 3006.5 for the purpose of elevator passenger and firefighter safety. This amendment is contingent on the Building Code amendment eliminating the Exceptions to Section 3006.4, such that passive fire barriers for these areas are maintained.) 
Section 903.2; delete the exception. 
(Reason: The exception deletion is due to the fact that such telecom areas pose an undue fire risk to the structural integrity of the building.) 
Section 903.2.9; add Section 903.2.9.3 to read as follows: 
903.2.9.3 Self-Service Storage Facility. An automatic sprinkler system shall be installed throughout all self-service storage facilities. 
(Reason: Fire departments are unable to inspect these commercial occupancies and are unaware of the contents being stored. Previous allowance to separate units by fire barriers is difficult to enforce maintenance after opening.) 
Section 903.2.11; change 903.2.11.3 and add 903.2.11.7, 903.2.11.8, and 903.2.11.9 as follows: 
903.2.11.3 Buildings 35 feet or more in height. An automatic sprinkler system shall be installed throughout buildings that have one or more stories, other than penthouses in compliance with Section 1510 of the International Building Code, located 35 feet (10,668 mm) or more above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access, measured to the finished floor. 
Exception: 
Open parking structures in compliance with Section 406.5 of the International Building Code, having no other occupancies above the subject garage. 
903.2.11.7 High-Piled Combustible Storage. For any building with a clear height exceeding 12 feet (4572 mm), see Chapter 32 to determine if those provisions apply. 
903.2.11.8 Spray Booths and Rooms. New and existing spray booths and spraying rooms shall be protected by an approved automatic fire-extinguishing system. 
903.2.11.9 Buildings Over 6,000 sq. ft. An automatic sprinkler system shall be installed throughout all buildings with a building area 6,000 sq. ft. or greater and in all existing buildings that are enlarged to be 6,000 sq. ft. or greater. For the purpose of this provision, fire walls shall not define separate buildings. 
Exception: Open parking garages in compliance with Section 406.5 of the International Building Code. 
(Reason: Provides jurisdictions options as to their desired level of sprinkler protection based on multiple factors including firefighting philosophies/capabilities.) 
Section 903.3.1.1.1; change to read as follows: 
903.3.1.1.1 Exempt Locations. When approved by the fire code official, automatic sprinklers shall not be required in the following rooms or areas where such ...{text unchanged}... because it is damp, of fire-resistance-rated construction or contains electrical equipment. 
1.  Any room where the application of water, or flame and water, constitutes a serious life or fire hazard. 
2.  Any room or space where sprinklers are considered undesirable because of the nature of the contents, when approved by the code official. 
3.  Generator and transformer rooms, under the direct control of a public utility, separated from the remainder of the building by walls and floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assemblies having a fire-resistance rating of not less than 2 hours. 
4.  {Delete.} 
5.  Elevator machine rooms, machinery spaces, and hoistways, other than pits where such sprinklers would not necessitate shunt trip requirements under any circumstances. 
6.  {Delete.} 
(Reason: Gives more direction to code official. Exception 4 deleted to provide protection where fire risks are poorly addressed. Amendment 903.2 addresses Exception 5 above relative to the elimination of sprinkler protection in these areas to avoid the shunt trip requirement.) 
Section 903.3.1.2.3; add section to read as follows: 
[F] Section 903.3.1.2.3 Attics and Attached Garages. Sprinkler protection is required in attic spaces of such buildings two or more stories in height, in accordance with NFPA 13 and or NFPA 13R requirements, and attached garages. 
(Reason: Attic protection is required due to issues with fire exposure via soffit vents, as well as firefighter safety. Several jurisdictions indicated experience with un-protected attic fires resulting in displacement of all building occupants. NFPA 13 provides for applicable attic sprinkler protection requirements, as well as exemptions to such, based on noncombustible construction, etc. Attached garages already require sprinklers via NFPA 13R - this amendment just re-emphasizes the requirement.) 
Section 903.3.1.3; change to read as follows: 
903.3.1.3 NFPA 13D Sprinkler Systems. Automatic sprinkler systems installed in one- and two-family dwellings; Group R-3; Group R-4 Condition 1 and townhouses shall be permitted to be installed throughout in accordance with NFPA 13D or in accordance with state law. 
(Reason: To allow the use of the Plumbing section of the International Residential Code (IRC) and recognize current state stipulations in this regard.) 
Section 903.3.1.4; add to read as follows: 
[F] 903.3.1.4 Freeze protection. Freeze protection systems for automatic fire sprinkler systems shall be in accordance with the requirements of the applicable referenced NFPA standard and this section. 
903.3.1.4.1 Attics. Only dry-pipe, preaction, or listed antifreeze automatic fire sprinkler systems shall be allowed to protect attic spaces. 
Exception: Wet-pipe fire sprinkler systems shall be allowed to protect non-ventilated attic spaces where: 
1.  The attic sprinklers are supplied by a separate floor control valve assembly to allow ease of draining the attic system without impairing sprinklers throughout the rest of the building, and 
2.  Adequate heat shall be provided for freeze protection as per the applicable referenced NFPA standard, and 
3.  The attic space is a part of the building's thermal, or heat, envelope, such that insulation is provided at the roof deck, rather than at the ceiling level. 
903.3.1.4.2 Heat trace/insulation. Heat trace/insulation shall only be allowed where approved by the fire code official for small sections of large diameter water-filled pipe. 
(Reason: In the last few years, severe winters brought to light several issues with current practices for sprinklering attics, not the least of which was wet-pipe sprinklers in ventilated attics provided with space heaters, etc., for freeze protection of such piping. This practice is not acceptable for the protection of water-filled piping in a ventilated attic space as it does not provide a reliable means of maintaining the minimum 40 degrees required by NFPA, wastes energy, and presents a potential ignition source to the attic space. Listed antifreeze is specifically included because NFPA currently allows such even though there is no currently listed antifreeze at the time of development of these amendments. The intent of this amendment is to help reduce the large number of freeze breaks that have occurred in the past with water-filled wet-pipe sprinkler systems in the future, most specifically in attic spaces.) 
Section 903.3.5; add a second paragraph to read as follows: 
[F] Water supply as required for such systems shall be provided in conformance with the supply requirements of the respective standards; however, every water-based fire protection system shall be designed with a 10 psi safety factor. Reference Section 507.4 for additional design requirements. 
(Reason: To define uniform safety factor.) 
Section 903.4; add a second paragraph after the exceptions to read as follows: 
Sprinkler and standpipe system water-flow detectors shall be provided for each floor tap to the sprinkler system and shall cause an alarm upon detection of water flow for more than 45 seconds. All control valves in the sprinkler and standpipe systems except for fire department hose connection valves shall be electrically supervised to initiate a supervisory signal at the central station upon tampering. 
(Reason: To avoid significant water losses. Consistent with amendment to IFC 905.9.) 
Section 903.4.2; add second paragraph to read as follows: 
The alarm device required on the exterior of the building shall be a weatherproof horn/strobe notification appliance with a minimum 75 candela strobe rating, installed as close as practicable to the fire department connection. 
(Reason: Fire department connections are not always located at the riser; this allows the fire department faster access.) 
Section 905.2; change to read as follows: 
905.2 Installation Standard. Standpipe systems shall be installed in accordance with this section and NFPA 14. Manual dry standpipe systems shall be supervised with a minimum of 10 psig and a maximum of 40 psig air pressure with a high/low alarm. 
(Reason: To define manual dry standpipe supervision requirements. Helps ensure the integrity of the standpipe system via supervision, such that open hose valves will result in a supervisory low air alarm.) 
Section 905.3; add Section 905.3.9 and exception to read as follows: 
905.3.9 Buildings Exceeding 10,000 sq. ft. In buildings exceeding 10,000 square feet in area per story and where any portion of the building's interior area is more than 200 feet (60960 mm) of travel, vertically and horizontally, from the nearest point of fire department vehicle access, Class I automatic wet or manual wet standpipes shall be provided. 
Exceptions: 
1.  Automatic dry and semi-automatic dry standpipes are allowed as provided for in NFPA 14. 
2.  R-2 occupancies of four stories or less in height having no interior corridors. 
(Reason: Allows for the rapid deployment of hose lines to the body of the fire.) 
Section 905.4, change Item 1, 3, and 5, and add Item 7 to read as follows: 
1.  In every required exit stairway, a hose connection shall be provided for each story above and below grade plane. Hose connections shall be located at an intermediate landing between stories, unless otherwise approved by the fire code official. 
2.  {No change.} 
3.  In every exit passageway, at the entrance from the exit passageway to other areas of a building. 
Exception: Where floor areas adjacent to an exit passageway are reachable from an exit stairway hose connection by a {No change to rest.} 
4.  {No change.} 
5.  Where the roof has a slope less than four units vertical in 12 units horizontal (33.3-percent slope), each standpipe shall be provided with a two-way hose connection located to serve the roof or at the highest landing of an exit stairway with stair access to the roof provided in accordance with Section 1011.12. 
6.  {No change.} 
7.  When required by this Chapter, standpipe connections shall be placed adjacent to all required exits to the structure and at two hundred feet (200') intervals along major corridors thereafter, or as otherwise approved by the fire code official. 
(Reason: Item 1, 3, and 5 amendments to remove 'interior' will help to clarify that such connections are required for all 'exit' stairways, to ensure firefighter capabilities are not diminished in these tall buildings, simply because the stair is on the exterior of the building. Item 5 reduces the amount of pressure required to facilitate testing, and provides backup protection for fire fighter safety. Item 7 allows for the rapid deployment of hose lines to the body of the fire.) 
Section 905.9; add a second paragraph after the exceptions to read as follows: 
Sprinkler and standpipe system water-flow detectors shall be provided for each floor tap to the sprinkler system and shall cause an alarm upon detection of water flow for more than 45 seconds. All control valves in the sprinkler and standpipe systems except for fire department hose connection valves shall be electrically supervised to initiate a supervisory signal at the central station upon tampering. 
(Reason: To avoid significant water losses. Consistent with amendment to IFC 903.4.) 
Section 907.1; add Section 907.1.4 and 907.1.4.1 to read as follows: 
907.1.4 Design Standards. Where a new fire alarm system is installed, the devices shall be addressable. Fire alarm systems utilizing more than 20 smoke detectors shall have analog initiating devices. 
(Reason: Provides for the ability of descriptive identification of alarms, and reduces need for panel replacement in the future. Updated wording to match the language of the new requirement at 907.5.2.3. Change of terminology allows for reference back to definitions of NFPA 72) 
Section 907.2.1; change to read as follows: 
907.2.1 Group A. A manual fire alarm system that activates the occupant notification system in accordance with Section 907.5 shall be installed in Group A occupancies having an occupant load of 300 or more persons or more than 100 persons above or below the lowest level of exit discharge. Group A occupancies not separated from one another in accordance with Section 707.3.10 of the International Building Code shall be considered as a single occupancy for the purposes of applying this section. Portions of Group E occupancies occupied for assembly purposes shall be provided with a fire alarm system as required for the Group E occupancy. 
Exception: {No change.} 
Activation of fire alarm notification appliances shall: 
1.  Cause illumination of the means of egress with light of not less than 1 foot-candle (11 lux) at the walking surface level, and 
2.  Stop any conflicting or confusing sounds and visual distractions. 
(Reason: Increases the requirement to be consistent with Group B requirement. Also addresses issue found in Group A occupancies of reduced lighting levels and other A/V equipment that distracts from fire alarm notification devices or reduces ability of fire alarm system to notify occupants of the emergency condition.) 
Section 907.2.3; change to read as follows: 
907.2.3 Group E. A manual fire alarm system that initiates the occupant notification signal utilizing an emergency voice/alarm communication system meeting the requirements of Section 907.5.2.2 and installed in accordance with Section 907.6 shall be installed in Group E educational occupancies. When automatic sprinkler systems or smoke detectors are installed, such systems or detectors shall be connected to the building fire alarm system. An approved smoke detection system shall be installed in Group E day care occupancies. Unless separated by a minimum of 100' open space, all buildings, whether portable buildings or the main building, will be considered one building for alarm occupant load consideration and interconnection of alarm systems. 
Exceptions: 
1.  {No change.} 
1.1.  Residential In-Home day care with not more than 12 children may use interconnected single station detectors in all habitable rooms. (For care of more than five children 21/2 or less years of age, see Section 907.2.6.) {No change to remainder of exceptions.} 
(Reason: To distinguish educational from day care occupancy minimum protection requirements. Further, to define threshold at which portable buildings are considered a separate building for the purposes of alarm systems. Exceptions provide consistency with State law concerning such occupancies.) 
Section 907.2.13, Exception 3; change to read as follows: 
3.  Open air portions of buildings with an occupancy in Group A-5 in accordance with Section 303.1 of the International Building Code; however, this exception does not apply to accessory uses including but not limited to sky boxes, restaurants, and similarly enclosed areas. 
(Reason: To indicate that enclosed areas within open air seating type occupancies are not exempted from automatic fire alarm system requirements.) 
Section 907.4.2; add Section 907.4.2.7 to read as follows: 
907.4.2.7 Type. Manual alarm initiating devices shall be an approved double action type. 
(Reason: Helps to reduce false alarms.) 
Section 907.6.1; add Section 907.6.1.1 to read as follows: 
907.6.1.1 Wiring Installation. All fire alarm systems shall be installed in such a manner that a failure of any single initiating device or single open in an initiating circuit conductor will not interfere with the normal operation of other such devices. All signaling line circuits (SLC) shall be installed in such a way that a single open will not interfere with the operation of any addressable devices (Class A). Outgoing and return SLC conductors shall be installed in accordance with NFPA 72 requirements for Class A circuits and shall have a minimum of four feet separation horizontal and one foot vertical between supply and return circuit conductors. The initiating device circuit (IDC) from a signaling line circuit interface device may be wired Class B, provided the distance from the interface device to the initiating device is ten feet or less. 
(Reason: To provide uniformity in system specifications and guidance to design engineers. Improves reliability of fire alarm devices and systems.) 
Section 907.6.3; delete all four Exceptions. 
(Reason: To assist responding personnel in locating the emergency event for all fire alarm systems. This is moved from 907.6.5.3 in the 2012 IFC and reworded to match new code language and sections.) 
Section 907.6.6; - add sentence at end of paragraph to read as follows: 
[F] See 907.6.3 for the required information transmitted to the supervising station. 
(Reason: To assist responding personnel in locating the emergency event for all fire alarm systems. This is moved from 907.6.5.3 in the 2012 IFC and reworded to match new code language and sections.) 
Section 909.22; add to read as follows: 
909.22 Stairway or Ramp Pressurization Alternative. Where the building is equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1 and the stair pressurization alternative is chosen for compliance with Building Code requirements for a smokeproof enclosure, interior exit stairways or ramps shall be pressurized to a minimum of 0.10 inches of water (25 Pa) and a maximum of 0.35 inches of water (87 Pa) in the shaft relative to the building measured with all interior exit stairway and ramp doors closed under maximum anticipated conditions of stack effect and wind effect. Such systems shall comply with Section 909, including the installation of a separate fire-fighter's smoke control panel as per Section 909.16, and a Smoke Control Permit shall be required from the fire department as per Section 105.7. 
[F] 909.22.1 Ventilating equipment. The activation of ventilating equipment for the stair or ramp pressurization system shall be by smoke detectors installed at each floor level at an approved location at the entrance to the smokeproof enclosure. When the closing device for the stairway or ramp shaft and vestibule doors is activated by smoke detection or power failure, the mechanical equipment shall activate and operate at the required performance levels. Smoke detectors shall be installed in accordance with Section 907.3. 
909.22.1.1 Ventilation Systems. Smokeproof enclosure ventilation systems shall be independent of other building ventilation systems. The equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall comply with one of the following: 
1.  Equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall be located exterior to the building and directly connected to the smokeproof enclosure or connected to the smokeproof enclosure by ductwork enclosed by not less than 2-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the Building Code, or both. 
2.  Equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall be located within the smokeproof enclosure with intake or exhaust directly from and to the outside or through ductwork enclosed by not less than 2-hour barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the Building Code, or both. 
3.  Equipment, control wiring, power wiring and ductwork shall be located within the building if separated from the remainder of the building, including other mechanical equipment, by not less than 2-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 of the Building Code or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711 of the Building Code, or both. 
Exceptions: 
1.  Control wiring and power wiring utilizing a 2-hour rated cable or cable system. 
2.  Where encased with not less than 2 inches (51 mm) of concrete. 
3.  Control wiring and power wiring protected by a listed electrical circuit protective systems with a fire-resistance rating of not less than 2 hours. 
909.21.1.2 Standby Power. Mechanical vestibule and stairway and ramp shaft ventilation systems and automatic fire detection systems shall be provided with standby power in accordance with Section 2702 of the Building Code. 
909.22.1.3 Acceptance and Testing. Before the mechanical equipment is approved, the system shall be tested in the presence of the fire code official to confirm that the system is operating in compliance with these requirements. 
(Reason: To assist with enforcement of such as a smoke control system, as per Section 909.6.3, especially since a permit is now specifically required for such systems in the Fire Code. Also ensures that a firefighter's override panel is provided as per 909.16 for such systems. The above amendment copies the applicable requirements for such systems from Section 909.20 of the Building Code into the Fire Code. Although the published code did copy the elevator pressurization requirements into the Fire Code, it did not copy over the stair pressurization requirements.) 
Section 910.2; change Exception 2. and 3. to read as follows: 
[F] 2.  Only manual smoke and heat removal shall be required in areas of buildings equipped with early suppression fast-response (ESFR) sprinklers. Automatic smoke and heat removal is prohibited. 
3.  Only manual smoke and heat removal shall be required in areas of buildings equipped with control mode special application sprinklers with a response time index of 50(m*S) 1/2 or less that are listed to control a fire in stored commodities with 12 or fewer sprinklers. Automatic smoke and heat removal is prohibited. 
(Reason: Allows the fire department to control the smoke and heat during and after a fire event, while still prohibiting such systems from being automatically activated, which is a potential detriment to the particular sprinkler systems indicated.) 
Section 910.2; add subsections 910.2.3 with exceptions to read as follows: 
910.2.3 Group H. Buildings and portions thereof used as a Group H occupancy as follows: 
1.  In occupancies classified as Group H-2 or H-3, any of which are more than 15,000 square feet (1394 m 2 ) in single floor area. 
Exception: Buildings of noncombustible construction containing only noncombustible materials. 
2.  In areas of buildings in Group H used for storing Class 2, 3, and 4 liquid and solid oxidizers, Class 1 and unclassified detonable organic peroxides, Class 3 and 4 unstable (reactive) materials, or Class 2 or 3 water-reactive materials as required for a high-hazard commodity classification. 
Exception: Buildings of noncombustible construction containing only noncombustible materials. 
(Reason: Maintains a fire protection device utilized in such occupancies where it is sometimes necessary to allow chemicals to burn out, rather than extinguish.) 
Section 910.3; add section 910.3.4 to read as follows: 
910.3.4 Vent Operation. Smoke and heat vents shall be capable of being operated by approved automatic and manual means. Automatic operation of smoke and heat vents shall conform to the provisions of Sections 910.3.2.1 through 910.3.2.3. 
[F] 910.3.4.1 Sprinklered buildings. Where installed in buildings equipped with an approved automatic sprinkler system, smoke and heat vents shall be designed to operate automatically. 
The automatic operating mechanism of the smoke and heat vents shall operate at a temperature rating at least 100 degrees F (approximately 38 degrees Celsius) greater than the temperature rating of the sprinklers installed. 
Exception: Manual only systems per Section 910.2. 
910.3.4.2 Nonsprinklered Buildings. Where installed in buildings not equipped with an approved automatic sprinkler system, smoke and heat vents shall operate automatically by actuation of a heat-responsive device rated at between 100°F (56°C) and 220°F (122°C) above ambient. 
Exception: Listed gravity-operated drop out vents. 
(Reason: Amendment continues to keep applicable wording from prior to the 2012 edition of the IFC. Specifically, automatic activation criteria is no longer specifically required in the published code. Specifying a temperature range at which smoke and heat vents should activate in sprinklered buildings helps to ensure that the sprinkler system has an opportunity to activate and control the fire prior to vent operation.) 
Section 910.4.3.1; change to read as follows: 
910.4.3.1 Makeup Air. Makeup air openings shall be provided within 6 feet (1829 mm) of the floor level. Operation of makeup air openings shall be automatic. The minimum gross area of makeup air inlets shall be 8 square feet per 1,000 cubic feet per minute (0.74 m2 per 0.4719 m3/s) of smoke exhaust. 
(Reason: Makeup air has been required to be automatic for several years now in this region when mechanical smoke exhaust systems are proposed. This allows such systems to be activated from the smoke control panel by first responders without having to physically go around the exterior of the building opening doors manually. Such requires a significant number of first responders on scene to conduct this operation and significantly delays activation and/or capability of the smoke exhaust system.) 
Section 910.4.4; change to read as follows: 
910.4.4 Activation. The mechanical smoke removal system shall be activated automatically by the automatic sprinkler system or by an approved fire detection system. Individual manual controls shall also be provided. 
Exception: Manual only systems per Section 910.2. 
(Reason: The provision of a manual only mechanical smoke removal system does not provide equivalency with automatic smoke and heat vents. This amendment clarifies that the primary intent is for automatic systems, unless exceptions are provided as in 910.2 - consistent with the charging statements of the section.) 
Section 912.2; add Section 912.2.3 to read as follows: 
912.2.3 Hydrant Distance. An approved fire hydrant shall be located within 100 feet of the fire department connection as the fire hose lays along an unobstructed path. 
(Reason: To accommodate limited hose lengths, improve response times where the FDC is needed to achieve fire control, and improve ease of locating a fire hydrant in those situations also. Also, consistent with NFPA 14 criteria.) 
Section 913.2.1; add second paragraph and exception to read as follows: 
When located on the ground level at an exterior wall, the fire pump room shall be provided with an exterior fire department access door that is not less than 3 ft. in width and 6 ft.-8 in. in height, regardless of any interior doors that are provided. A key box shall be provided at this door, as required by Section 506.1. 
Exception: When it is necessary to locate the fire pump room on other levels or not at an exterior wall, the corridor leading to the fire pump room access from the exterior of the building shall be provided with equivalent fire resistance as that required for the pump room, or as approved by the fire code official. Access keys shall be provided in the key box as required by Section 506.1. 
(Reason: This requirement allows fire fighters safer access to the fire pump room. The requirement allows access without being required to enter the building and locate the fire pump room interior access door during a fire event. The exception recognizes that this will not always be a feasible design scenario for some buildings, and as such, provides an acceptable alternative to protect the pathway to the fire pump room.) 
Section 914.3.1.2; change to read as follows: 
914.3.1.2 Water Supply to required Fire Pumps. In buildings that are more than 120 feet (128 m) in building height, required fire pumps shall be supplied by connections to no fewer than two water mains located in different streets. Separate supply piping shall be provided between each connection to the water main and the pumps. Each connection and the supply piping between the connection and the pumps shall be sized to supply the flow and pressure required for the pumps to operate. 
Exception: {No change to exception.} 
(Reason: The 2009 edition of the IFC added this requirement based on a need for redundancy of the water supply similar to the redundancy of the power supply to the fire pumps required for such tall buildings, partially due to the fact that these buildings are rarely fully evacuated in a fire event. More commonly, the alarm activates on the floor of the event, the floor above and the floor below. Back-up power to the fire pump becomes critical for this reason. Certainly, the power is pointless if the water supply is impaired for any reason, so a similar requirement is provided here for redundant water supplies. The 2015 edition changes the requirement to only apply to very tall buildings over 420 ft. This amendment modifies/lowers the requirement to 120 ft., based on this same height requirement for fire service access elevators. Again, the language from the 2009 and 2012 editions of the code applied to any high-rise building. This compromise at 120 feet is based on the above technical justification of defend-in-place scenarios in fire incidents in such tall structures.) 
Section 1006.2.2.6; add a new Section 1006.2.2.6 as follows: 
1006.2.2.6 Electrical Rooms. For electrical rooms, special exiting requirements may apply. Reference the Electrical Code as adopted. 
(Reason: Cross reference necessary for coordination with the NEC which has exiting requirements as well.) 
Section 1009.1; add the following Exception 4: 
Exceptions: 
{previous exceptions unchanged} 
4.  Buildings regulated under State Law and built in accordance with State registered plans, including any variances or waivers granted by the State, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of Section 1009. 
(Reason: To accommodate buildings regulated under Texas State Law and to be consistent with amendments to Chapter 11.) 
Section 1010.1.9.4 Bolt Locks; change Exceptions 3 and 4 to read as follows: 
Exceptions: 
3.  Where a pair of doors serves an occupant load of less than 50 persons in a Group B, F, M or S occupancy. {Remainder unchanged} 
4.  Where a pair of doors serves a Group A, B, F, M or S occupancy {Remainder unchanged} 
(Reason: Application to M occupancies reflects regional practice; No. 4 expanded to Group A due to it being a similar scenario to other uses; No. 4 was regional practice.) 
Section 1015.8 Window Openings; change number 1 to read as follows: 
1.  Operable windows where the top of the sill of the opening is located more than) 55 (16 764 mm) above the finished grade or other surface below and that are provided with window fall prevention devices that comply with ASTM F 2006. 
(Reason: In Option B jurisdictions, change "75 feet" to "55 feet".) 
Section 1020.1 Construction; add Exception 6 to read as follows: 
6.  In group B occupancies, corridor walls and ceilings need not be of fire-resistive construction within a single tenant space when the space is equipped with approved automatic smoke-detection within the corridor. The actuation of any detector shall activate self-annunciating alarms audible in all areas within the corridor. Smoke detectors shall be connected to an approved automatic fire alarm system where such system is provided. 
(Reason: Revise the 2012 published NCTCOG amendment to this section to clarify intent is not to require automatic fire alarm system or notification throughout the tenant space, but rather, only in the corridor.) 
Section 1029.1.1.1; delete this section. Spaces under Grandstands and Bleachers: 
(Reason: Unenforceable.) 
Section 1031.2; change to read as follows: 
1031.2 Reliability. Required exit accesses, exits and exit discharges shall be continuously maintained free from obstructions or impediments to full instant use in the case of fire or other emergency. An exit or exit passageway shall not be used for any purpose that interferes with a means of egress. 
(Reason: Maintain legacy levels of protection and long-standing regional practice, and provide firefighter safety.) 
Section 1103.3; add sentence to end of paragraph as follows: 
Provide emergency signage as required by Section 607.3. 
(Reason: Coordinates requirements of previous amendment.) 
Section 1103.5; add Section 1103.5.1 to read as follows: 
1103.5.1 Group A-2. Spray Booths and Rooms. Existing spray booths and spray rooms shall be protected by an approved automatic fire-extinguishing system in accordance with Section 2404. 
(Reason: Consistent with amendment to IFC 2404, and long-standing regional requirement. The published 1103.5.1 requiring sprinklers retroactively in A-2 occupancies was deleted by ICC Errata.) 
Section 1103.7; add Section 1103.7.8 and 1103.7.8.1 to read as follows: 
1103.7.8 Fire Alarm System Design Standards. Where an existing fire alarm system is upgraded or replaced, the devices shall be addressable. Fire alarm systems utilizing more than 20 smoke and/or heat detectors shall have analog initiating devices. 
Exception: Existing systems need not comply unless the total building, or fire alarm system, remodel or expansion exceeds 30% of the building. When cumulative building, or fire alarm system, remodel or expansion initiated after the date of original fire alarm panel installation exceeds 50% of the building, or fire alarm system, the fire alarm system must comply within 18 months of permit application. 
1103.7.8.1 Communication requirements. Refer to Section 907.6.6 for applicable requirements. 
(Reason: To assist responding personnel in locating the emergency event and provide clarity as to percentages of work that results in a requirement to upgrade the entire fire alarm system.) 
Section 2304.1; change to read as follows: 
2304.1 Supervision of Dispensing. The dispensing of fuel at motor fuel-dispensing facilities shall be in accordance with the following: 
1.  Conducted by a qualified attendant; and/or, 
2.  Shall be under the supervision of a qualified attendant; and/or 
3.  Shall be an unattended self-service facility in accordance with Section 2304.3. 
At any time the qualified attendant of item Number 1 or 2 above is not present, such operations shall be considered as an unattended self-service facility and shall also comply with Section 2304.3. 
(Reason: Allows a facility to apply the attended and unattended requirements of the code when both are potentially applicable.) 
Section 2401.2; delete this section. 
(Reason: This section eliminates such booths from all compliance with Chapter 15 including, but not limited to: size, ventilation, fire protection, construction, etc. If the product utilized is changed to a more flammable substance, the lack of compliance with Chapter 15 could result in significant fire or deflagration and subsequent life safety hazard.) 
Table 3206.2, footnote j; change text to read as follows: 
j.  Where storage areas are protected by either early suppression fast response (ESFR) sprinkler systems or control mode special application sprinklers with a response time index of 50 (m  s) 1/2 or less that are listed to control a fire in the stored commodities with 12 or fewer sprinklers, installed in accordance with NFPA 13, manual smoke and heat vents or manually activated engineered mechanical smoke exhaust systems shall be required within these areas. 
(Reason: Allows the fire department to control the smoke and heat during and after a fire event, while ensuring proper operation of the sprinkler protection provided. Also, gives an alternative to smoke and heat vents.) 
Section 3310.1; add sentence to end of paragraph to read as follows: 
When fire apparatus access roads are required to be installed for any structure or development, they shall be approved prior to the time at which construction has progressed beyond completion of the foundation of any structure. 
(Reason: Reference requirement of Section 501.4.) 
Section 5601.1.3; change to read as follows: 
5601.1.3 Fireworks. The possession, manufacture, storage, sale, handling, and use of fireworks are prohibited. 
Exceptions: 
1.  Only when approved for fireworks displays, storage, and handling of fireworks as allowed in Section 5604 and 5608. 
2.  The use of fireworks for approved fireworks displays as allowed in Section 5608. 
... {Delete remainder of text.} 
(Reason: Restricts fireworks to approved displays only, which is consistent with regional practice. Such is intended to help protect property owners and individuals from unintentional fireworks fires within the jurisdiction, as well as to help protect individuals from fireworks injuries. It is noted that there has been a change in the State Law to allow possession of unopened fireworks in certain areas of the vehicle, and it is highly recommended that AHJs familiarize themselves with the applicable State Laws in this regard.) 
Section 5703.6; add a sentence to read as follows: 
5703.6 Piping Systems. Piping systems, and their component parts, for flammable and combustible liquids shall be in accordance with Sections 5703.6.1 through 5703.6.11. An approved method of secondary containment shall be provided for underground tank and piping systems. 
(Reason: Increased protection in response to underground leak problems and remediation difficulty in underground applications. Coordinates with TCEQ requirements.) 
Section 5704.2.9.5; change Section 5704.2.9.5 and add Section 5704.2.9.5.3 to read as follows: 
5704.2.9.5 Above-ground Tanks Inside of Buildings. Above-ground tanks inside of buildings shall comply with Section 5704.2.9.5.1 through 5704.2.9.5.3. 
5704.2.9.5.1 {No change.} 
5704.2.9.5.2 {No change.} 
5704.2.9.5.3 Combustible Liquid Storage Tanks Inside of Buildings. The maximum aggregate allowable quantity limit shall be 3,000 gallons (11 356 L) of Class II or III combustible liquid for storage in protected aboveground tanks complying with Section 5704.2.9.7 when all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The entire 3,000 gallon (11 356 L) quantity shall be stored in protected above-ground tanks; 
2.  The 3,000 gallon (11 356 L) capacity shall be permitted to be stored in a single tank or multiple smaller tanks; 
3.  The tanks shall be located in a room protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with Section 903.3.1.1; and 
4.  Tanks shall be connected to fuel-burning equipment, including generators, utilizing an approved closed piping system. 
The quantity of combustible liquid stored in tanks complying with this section shall not be counted towards the maximum allowable quantity set forth in Table 5003.1.1(1), and such tanks shall not be required to be located in a control area. Such tanks shall not be located more than two stories below grade. 
(Reason: Relocated from exception to 603.3.2.1 as published, as per reason statement for deletion in that section.) 
Section 5704.2.11.4; add a sentence to read as follows: 
5704.2.11.4 Leak Prevention. Leak prevention for underground tanks shall comply with Sections 5704.2.11.4.1 through 5704.2.11.4.3. An approved method of secondary containment shall be provided for underground tank and piping systems.

Section 5704.2.11.4.2; change to read as follows: 
5704.2.11.4.2 Leak Detection. Underground storage tank systems shall be provided with an approved method of leak detection from any component of the system that is designed and installed in accordance with NFPA 30 and as specified in Section 5704.2.11.4.3. 
(Reason: Reference to IFC Section 5704.2.11.4.3 amendment.) 
Section 5704.2.11.4; add Section 5704.2.11.4.3 to read as follows: 
5704.2.11.4.3 Observation Wells. Approved sampling tubes of a minimum 4 inches in diameter shall be installed in the backfill material of each underground flammable or combustible liquid storage tank. The tubes shall extend from a point 12 inches below the average grade of the excavation to ground level and shall be provided with suitable surface access caps. Each tank site shall provide a sampling tube at the corners of the excavation with a minimum of 4 tubes. Sampling tubes shall be placed in the product line excavation within 10 feet of the tank excavation and one every 50 feet routed along product lines towards the dispensers, a minimum of two are required. 
(Reason: Provides an economical means of checking potential leaks at each tank site.) 
Section 6103.2.1; add Section 6103.2.1.8 to read as follows: 
6103.2.1.8 Jewelry Repair, Dental Labs and Similar Occupancies. Where natural gas service is not available, portable LP-Gas containers are allowed to be used to supply approved torch assemblies or similar appliances. Such containers shall not exceed 20-pound (9.0 kg) water capacity. Aggregate capacity shall not exceed 60-pound (27.2 kg) water capacity. Each device shall be separated from other containers by a distance of not less than 20 feet. 
(Reason: To provide a consistent and reasonable means of regulating the use of portable LP-Gas containers in these situations. Reduces the hazard presented by portable containers when natural gas is already available. Please note that current State Law does not allow for the enforcement of any rules more stringent than that adopted by the State, so this amendment is only applicable as to the extent allowed by that State Law.) 
Section 6104.2, Exception; add an exception 2 to read as follows: 
Exceptions: 
1.  {existing text unchanged} 
2.  Except as permitted in Sections 308 and 6104.3.2, LP-gas containers are not permitted in residential areas. 
(Reason: To provide a consistent and reasonable means of regulating the use LP-Gas containers. Reduces the hazard presented by such containers when natural gas is already available. References regional amendment to IFC 6104.3.2. Please note that current State Law does not allow for the enforcement of any rules more stringent than that adopted by the State, so this amendment is only applicable as to the extent allowed by that State Law.) 
Section 6104.3; add Section 6104.3.2 to read as follows: 
6104.3.2 Spas, Pool Heaters, and Other Listed Devices. Where natural gas service is not available, an LP-gas container is allowed to be used to supply spa and pool heaters or other listed devices. Such container shall not exceed 250-gallon water capacity per lot. See Table 6104.3 for location of containers. 
Exception: Lots where LP-gas can be off-loaded wholly on the property where the tank is located may install up to 500 gallon above ground or 1,000 gallon underground approved containers. 
(Reason: Allows for an alternate fuel source. Dwelling density must be considered and possibly factored into zoning restrictions. Reduces the hazard presented by over-sized LP-Gas containers. Please note that current State Law does not allow for the enforcement of any rules more stringent than that adopted by the State, so this amendment is only applicable as to the extent allowed by that State Law.) 
Section 6107.4 and 6109.13; change to read as follows: 
6107.4 Protecting Containers from Vehicles. Where exposed to vehicular damage due to proximity to alleys, driveways or parking areas, LP-gas containers, regulators and piping shall be protected in accordance with Section 312. 
6109.13 Protection of Containers. LP-gas containers shall be stored within a suitable enclosure or otherwise protected against tampering. Vehicle impact protection shall be provided as required by Section 6107.4. 
(Reason: NFPA 58 does not provide substantial physical protection [it allows raised sidewalks, fencing, ditches, parking bumpers as 'vehicle barrier protection'] of the container(s) from vehicular impact as is required and has been required historically, as per Section 312, i.e., bollard protection. Further, the exception to Section 6109.13 would allow for portable containers in ventilated metal cabinets to not require any physical protection whatsoever from vehicular impact, regardless of the location of the containers. Please note that current State Law does not allow for the enforcement of any rules more stringent than that adopted by the State, so this amendment is only applicable as to the extent allowed by that State Law.) 
Appendix D 
Appendix D, Fire Apparatus Access Roads, is amended as follows: 
D103.1 Access Roads with a Hydrant and Figure D103.1 Dead-end Fire Apparatus Access Road Turnaround. Each reference to "26 feet" or "26'" are changed to be "24 feet" or "24'" respectively. The reference to "(7925 mm)" is changed to be "(7315 mm)". 
Table D103.4 Requirements for Dead-end Fire Apparatus Access Roads. Each reference to 20 feet contained in the width column is changed to 24 feet.

(b)  The city manager or his or her designee shall determine the total assessable costs and shall in consultation with other city personnel involved in responding to the public safety or fire emergency incident determine whether to assess any, all or part of such costs against any of the responsible parties. In making such determination, the following shall be considered: 
(1)  The total assessable costs; 
(2)  The fees set forth in the cost recovery fee schedule established and maintained pursuant to section 46-69 below; 
(3)  The risk the public safety or fire emergency incident imposed on the city, its residents and their property; 
(4)  Whether there was any injury or damage to person or property; 
(5)  Whether the public safety or fire emergency incident required evacuation; 
(6)  The extent the public safety or fire emergency incident required an unusual or extraordinary use of city personnel and equipment; and 
(7)  Whether there was any damage to the environment. 
(c)  After consideration of the factors in subsection (b) immediately above, the city manager or his or her designee may allocate assessable costs among and between responsible parties, including allocating all or some of such costs jointly and severally against more than one responsible party, regardless of whether a responsible party has other legal liability therefor or is legally at fault. 
(d)  If the city manager or his or her designee determines not to assess all or a part of assessable costs against a responsible party, such determination shall not in any way limit or extinguish the liability of the responsible party to other parties. 
(Ord. No. 2015-24 , § 2, 7-14-2015) 
Sec. 46-69. - Cost recovery fee schedule. 
    The fire chief or his or her designee is authorized and directed to establish and maintain a cost recovery fee schedule reflecting the reasonable costs of responding to a public safety or fire emergency incident, and the fees stated therein shall not exceed the city's actual cost in responding to a public safety or fire emergency incident. A copy of the cost recovery fee schedule shall at all times be maintained on file with the fire department and published on the city's website and shall have the same legal effect as if adopted by ordinance of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2015-24 , § 2, 7-14-2015) 
Sec. 46-70. - Billing and collection of assessable costs. 
    After determining to assess assessable costs against a responsible party, the city manager or his or her designee shall mail an itemized invoice to the responsible party at its last known address or to the responsible party's insurer at the insurer's address if provided. Such invoice shall be due and payable within 30 days of the date of mailing and any amounts unpaid after such date shall bear a late payment fee equal to one percent per month or fraction thereof that the amount due and any previously imposed late payment fee remains unpaid. If a responsible party shall appeal assessable costs pursuant to section 46-71, such costs, if upheld, in whole or in part, shall be due and payable 30 days from the date of determination of the appeal and any late payment fees shall apply thereafter. 
(Ord. No. 2015-24 , § 2, 7-14-2015) 
Sec. 46-71. - Procedure for appealing assessable costs. 
    Any responsible party who receives an invoice for assessable costs shall have an opportunity to meet with the city manager or his or her designee to request a modification of assessable costs. The responsible party shall request in writing such meeting within seven calendar days of the date of the invoice assessing the assessable costs. If after meeting with the city manager or his or her designee the responsible party is still not satisfied, he or she may request an opportunity to appear before the city council to further request a modification of assessable costs. A responsible party who desires to appear before the city council must first meet with the city manager or his or her designee as provided above and shall file a written request to appear before the city council with the city secretary within seven calendar days of the date of the meeting with the city manager. Upon receipt of such request, the city secretary will place the responsible party on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled city council meeting, which meeting is at least 14 calendar days after the date on which the responsible party files the request to appear. Any filed request to appear shall specifically identify and explain all reasons why the responsible party believes the assessed costs should be modified. Any reason, basis or argument for modification of assessable costs not set forth in the request to appear shall be deemed waived by the responsible party. Failure to timely file a written request to appear shall constitute a waiver of the responsible party's right to appear before the city council and shall further constitute the responsible party's agreement to pay the assessable costs invoiced. After a responsible party has been given an opportunity to appear before it, the city council shall promptly determine whether to confirm, modify or void the payment of assessable costs invoiced.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 50-31. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the Wylie City Council does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20 , § 3, 6-10-2014) 
Sec. 50-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Wylie are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20 , § 3, 6-10-2014) 
Sec. 50-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this division to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20 , § 3, 6-10-2014) 
Sec. 50-34. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this division uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

DIVISION 2. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 50-56. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this division its most reasonable application. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one-percent-annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map ("FIRM") with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map ("FHBM"). After detailed rate making has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation ("BFE") means the elevation shown on the FIRM and found in the accompanying flood insurance study ("FIS") for Zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year-also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of a building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building, which has its lowest elevated floor, raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures". 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood insurance rate map ("FIRM") means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study ("FIS") see flood elevation study. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see flooding). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."

    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the national flood insurance program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area -see area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction , except for new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), means substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements, see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum ("NAVD") of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(5)  Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with division 4, section 50-107(1); 
(b)  Approval or denial of a floodplain development permit by the flooplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this division and the following relevant factors: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(2)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(5)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(6)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; 
(7)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
(8)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(9)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use. 
Sec. 50-109. - Variance procedures 
(a)  The Wylie Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this section. 
(b)  The Wylie Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this division. 
(c)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Wylie Board of Adjustment and Appeals may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this division. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 50-108(b) of this division have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this division, the Wylie Board of Adjustment and Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article (division 1, section 50-33). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by Wylie for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in division 4, section 50-109(a)-(i) are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) division 3, section 50-79, (ii) division 4, section 50-107(8), or (iii) division 5, section 50-133(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction . New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in division 4, section 50-108(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction . New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least two feet above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures . New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.

(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on Wylie's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on Wylie's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on Wylie's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least two feet above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles . Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on Wylie's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of division 4, section 50-108(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20 , § 3, 6-10-2014) 
Sec. 50-133. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with division 1, sections 50-32, 50-33, and 50-34 of this article. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of division 3, section 50-80; division 4, section 50-108; and the provisions of division 5 of this article.

(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20 , § 3, 6-10-2014) 
Sec. 50-134. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in division 3, section 50-79, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least 2 feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on Wylie's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on Wylie's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in division 4, section 50-108 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20 , § 3, 6-10-2014) 
Sec. 50-135. - Floodways. 
    Floodways, located within areas of special flood hazard established in division 3, section 50-79, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within Wylie during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If division 5, section 50-135(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 5. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulation, Wylie may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that Wylie first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 2014-20 , § 3, 6-10-2014) 
Sec. 50-136. - Noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.

ARTICLE IV. - PARKLAND DEDICATION 

Sec. 78-71. - Purpose of article. 
(a)  This article is adopted to provide recreational areas in the form of municipal parks as a function of subdivision development in the city. This article is enacted in accordance with the home rule powers of the city, granted under the state constitution, and the statutes of the state including, but not by way of limitation, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 54.004, and ch. 212. It is hereby declared by the city council that recreational areas in the form of municipal parks are necessary and in the public welfare, and that the only adequate procedure to provide for municipal parks is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property or subdivision in the city, whether such development consists of new construction on vacant land or rebuilding and remodeling of structures on existing residential property. 
(b)  Municipal parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby. The park zones established by the parks and recreation department and shown on the official parks and recreation map for the city shall be prima facie proof that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from any residence located therein. The primary cost of municipal parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who, by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities. Therefore, this article is adopted to effect the purposes stated. 
(Ord. No. 2005-37, § 2, 9-27-2005) 
Sec. 78-72. - Dedication procedures. 
(a)  Whenever a final plat is filed of record with the county clerk of Collin County, Dallas County and/or Rockwall County, Texas for development of a residential area (including single-family and multifamily residential areas) in accordance with the subdivision, planning and zoning ordinances of the city, such plat shall contain a fee simple dedication of an area of land to the city for park purposes, which area shall equal five acres for each 100 proposed dwelling units. The dedication required by this article shall be made by filing of the final plat and/or, in the city's sole discretion, contemporaneously by separate instrument in the form of a warranty deed approved by the city. If the actual number of completed dwelling units exceeds the figure upon which the original dedication was based, such additional dedication shall be required, and shall be made by payment of money in lieu of land as provided in this article or by the fee simple dedication of land to the city by separate instrument in the form of a warranty deed approved by the city, at the sole discretion of the city council. 
(b)  The city council declares that development of an area smaller than five acres for public park purposes is impractical. Therefore, if fewer than 100 units are proposed by a plat filed for approval, the developer may be required to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount provided by subsection 78-73(c), rather than to dedicate any land area. No plat showing a dedication for park purposes of less than five acres shall be approved unless such plat and dedication is recommended for approval by the city parks and recreation board and subsequently approved by the city council. 
(c)  In all other instances, the city shall have the right to accept the dedication for approval on the final plat, or to refuse the dedication, after consideration of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation board, and to require payment of cash in lieu of land in the amount provided by subsection 78-73(c), if the city determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain in the area of the proposed development, or if the recreation potential for that zone would be better served by expanding or improving existing parks. 
(Ord. No. 2005-37, § 2, 9-27-2005; Ord. No. 2006-43, § 2, 7-25-2006) 
Sec. 78-73. - Money in lieu of land. 
(a)  Subject to approval of the city council, a land owner responsible for dedication under this article may elect to meet the requirements of section 78-72, in whole or in part, by a fee payment in lieu of land, in the amount set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Such payment in lieu of land shall be made at or prior to the time of final plat approval. Nonpayment of fee shall constitute grounds sufficient to deny approval of proposed plat. 
(b)  The city may, from time to time, decide to purchase land for parks in or near the area of actual or potential development. If the city does purchase park land in a park zone, subsequent park land dedications for that zone may be required to be in cash only, and calculated to reimburse the city's actual cost of acquisition and development of such land for parks. The fee amount shall be set out in the fee schedule in appendix C to this Code. Once the city has been reimbursed entirely for all such park land within a park zone, this section shall cease to apply, and the other subsections shall again be applicable. 
(c)  To the extent that subsection (b) of this section is not applicable, the dedication requirement shall be met by a payment of cash, in lieu of dedication of land, at a per acre price set from time to time by resolution by the city council, sufficient to acquire land and provide for adjacent streets and utilities for a municipal park to serve the park zone in which such development is located or to improve or expand existing park land in the park zone. Unless changed by the city council, such per acre price shall be based on a fee as set out in the fee schedule located in appendix C to this Code. Cash payments may be used only for acquisition or improvement of a municipal park located within the same zone as the development, or, upon recommendation of the park board and approval of the city council, funds from any and all park zones may be combined for special purposes with or without the option to reimburse the contributing zones. 
(Ord. No. 2005-37, § 2, 9-27-2005) 
Sec. 78-74. - Comprehensive plan considerations. 
    The city shall create and maintain a master park plan for the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. The city shall further designate the size of the parks and the zones which are to be supportive of these parks. Dedication of park land shall be in accordance with the master plan. The city will determine, the park location based on land suitability. This plan may be, from time to time, updated and amended at the pleasure of the approving authorities and as the review of proposed plats for development within those zones. 
(Ord. No. 2005-37, § 2, 9-27-2005) 
Sec. 78-75. - Park acquisition and improvement fund; right to refund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a special fund for the deposit of all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this article or any preceding article or any preceding ordinance, which fund shall be known as the park acquisition and improvement fund. Such fund may be subdivided to create as many separate funds as become necessary in order to ensure that all funds are separated by park zone and spent wholly and completely within such park zone. Upon recommendation of the park board and approval of the city council, funds from any and all park zones may be combined for special purposes. Each fund shall be separately audited in the annual audit of the city and shall be available for public review. 
(b)  The city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this article with reference to individual plats involved. Any funds paid for such purposes must be expended by the city within five years from the date received by the city for acquisition or development of a municipal park. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis. If not so expended, the owners of the property, on the last day of such period, shall be entitled to a pro-rata refund of such sum computed on a square footage of area basis. The owners of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right shall be barred. 
(c)  When residential developments occur in phases, all phases of the development shall meet applicable dedication requirements. If land dedication is to occur in a latter phase of the overall development, the dedication requirement for the initial phases shall be met by placing funds into an escrow account as directed by the city upon acceptance of each phase by the city. When the actual land dedication occurs, the escrowed funds plus interest shall be returned to the depositor. The depositor must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right shall be barred. If land dedication does not occur within five years of completion of the initial phase of the overall development, the escrowed funds plus interest shall be forfeited by the depositor and the funds shall become the property of the city.

ARTICLE III. - MORATORIUM ON MANUFACTURED HOME PARK ZONING 

Sec. 90-51. - Finding and justification. 
    The planning and zoning commission and the city council have determined that due to recent developments of manufactured home parks and existing manufactured home parks, the percentage of that type of development and dwelling is more than adequate and greater than the percentage which these two bodies have determined is in the best interests of the city. These two bodies have determined that the current zoning areas designated as manufactured home parks, along with those that are existing, constitute a sufficient number of dwelling units in this category and provide the widest possible distribution of varying types of housing and cost distribution. 
(Ord. No. 85-41, § I, 7-23-1985; Code 1991, ch. 12, § 4.01)

    No additional manufactured home park zoning will be granted until the number of dwelling units drops below five percent of the total number of all dwelling units authorized by platting and existing subdivisions within the city limits. 
(Ord. No. 85-41, § II, 7-23-1985; Code 1991, ch. 12, § 4.02)

    Previously existing use of land within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, both now and as it may be changed by future annexations, will be allowed to continue the current use of that property. However, zoning as a manufactured home park may or may not be authorized until the percentage criteria specified in section 90-52 is met. This decision shall be at the discretion of the planning and zoning commission and the city council and shall be subject to all appropriate legal and public notice provisions.

(Ord. No. 2001-54, § 1, 12-11-2001) 
Sec. 102-83. - Scope. 
    This article shall be effective within the geographical limits of the city, including any areas subsequently annexed by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2001-54, § 1, 12-11-2001) 
Sec. 102-84. - Purpose; objectives; applicability. 
(a)  Purpose. The city council hereby declares that its purpose in enacting this article is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public in connection with the use of city streets. This article provides principles, procedures and mechanisms for the placement of structures and facilities, construction, excavation, encroachments, and work activities within or upon any public right-of-way and to protect the integrity of the road and city utility system. This article does not grant any specific authority for occupation of the rights-of-way. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to require permits of private users of the public rights-of-way and to establish permit procedures, rules, and regulations for work done within or upon the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  Objectives. Public and private uses of public rights-of-way for location of facilities employed in the provision of public services should, in the interests of the general welfare, be accommodated; however, the city must ensure that the primary purpose of the rights-of-way, safe passage of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent possible. In addition, the value of other public and private installations, roadways, the city utility system, facilities and properties should be protected, competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety preserved. The use of the public rights-of-way by persons, agencies, and public infrastructure contractors is secondary to these public objectives and the movement of traffic. This article is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use of public rights-of-way for location of facilities by public and private entities. The article thus has several objectives: 
(1)  To ensure that the public safety is maintained and that public inconvenience is minimized by reducing disruption of and interference with the public use of streets. 
(2)  To protect the city's infrastructure investment by establishing repair standards for the pavement, facilities, and property in the public rights-of-way when work is accomplished. 
(3)  To facilitate work within the public rights-of-way through the standardization of regulations. 
(4)  To maintain an efficient permit process. 
(5)  To conserve and fairly apportion the limited physical capacity of the public rights-of-way held in public trust by the city. 
(6)  To establish a public policy for enabling the city to discharge its public trust consistent with the rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies, industry competition, and technological development. 
(7)  To promote cooperation among the agencies and public infrastructure contractors and the city in the occupation of the public rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to (i) eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or unsightly, (ii) lower the agencies', public infrastructure contractors' and the city's costs of providing services to the public, and (iii) preserve the physical integrity of the streets and highways by minimizing street cuts. 
(8)  To assure that the city can continue to fairly and responsibly protect the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(c)  Applicability. 
(1)  The requirements of this article apply to all persons, agencies, public infrastructure contractors and private users of the public rights-of-way except: 
a.  Persons, agencies, or public infrastructure contractors conducting projects for single-family and two-family residence zoned properties. All permits for these properties will be issued through the city's building inspection department. 
b.  New residential service connections that are permitted through the building inspection department of the city as provided in section 102-89(a)(4) below. 
(2)  Any permit issued prior to the effective date of this article, will remain subject to the terms and conditions of city ordinances and requirements in effect at the time of issuance of the permit and is not affected by this article, except that, upon expiration or conclusion of the permit, a new or renewal permit must be obtained in accordance with this article.

(Ord. No. 2001-54, § 1, 12-11-2001) 
Sec. 102-94. - General rights-of-way use and construction. 
(a)  Minimal interference. Work in the public rights-of-way shall be done in a manner that causes the least interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and residents. Agency's or public infrastructure contractor's facilities shall be constructed or maintained in such a manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other property of the city, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the rights-of-way by, or under, the city's authority. The agency's or public infrastructure contractor's facilities shall be located, erected, and maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, or to interfere with improvements the city may deem proper to make or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the rights-of-way or other public property, and shall not interfere with the travel and use of public places by the public during the construction, repair, operation, or removal thereof, and shall not obstruct or impede traffic. 
(b)  Responsibilities under permit; location of facilities. 
(1)  A permit does not relieve an agency or public infrastructure contractor of the responsibility to coordinate with other utilities and to protect existing facilities. An agency or public infrastructure contractor working in the right-of-way is responsible for obtaining line locations from all affected utilities or others with facilities in the right-of-way prior to any excavation. Use of the geographic information system or the plans of record does not satisfy this requirement. 
(2)  In performing location of facilities in the public rights-of-way in preparation for construction under a permit, agency or public infrastructure contractor shall compile all information obtained regarding its or any other facilities in the public rights-of-way related to a particular permit and shall make that information available to the city in a written and verified format acceptable to the city engineer. 
(3)  Before beginning excavation in any public right-of-way, an agency or public infrastructure contractor shall contact the state one-call system or any other company operating under the one-call statute and, to the extent required by V.T.C.A., Utilities Code ch. 251, make inquiries of all ditch companies, utility companies, districts, local government departments, and all other agencies that might have facilities in the area of work to determine possible conflicts. Field locations shall be marked prior to commencing work. The agency or public infrastructure contractor shall support and protect all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus that may be affected by the work from damage during construction or settlement of trenches subsequent to construction. 
(c)  Underground construction and use of poles. 
(1)  As required by the subdivision ordinance (appendix B) of the city and the comprehensive zoning ordinance (appendix A) and when required by general ordinances, regulations or rules of the city or applicable state or federal law, agency's or public infrastructure contractor's new facilities within subdivisions shall be placed underground at agency's or public infrastructure contractor's expense. Agencies and public infrastructure contractors may require developers or other third parties to bear this expense. Placing facilities underground does not preclude the use of ground-mounted appurtenances. Related equipment, such as pedestals, must be placed in accordance with the city's applicable code requirements and rules, including all visibility easement requirements. In areas where existing facilities are aerial, the agency or public infrastructure contractor may install aerial facilities if doing so does not violate any other city ordinance. 
(2)  The city will not require existing facilities to be placed underground. 
(3)  For aboveground facilities, the agency shall utilize existing poles wherever possible. Facilities shall be maintained in an appropriate manner. 
(4)  Should the city desire to place its own facilities in trenches or bores opened by the agency or public infrastructure contractor, the agency or public infrastructure contractor shall cooperate with the city in any construction by the agency or public infrastructure contractor that involves trenching or boring, provided that the city has first notified the agency or public infrastructure contractor in some manner that it is interested in sharing the trenches or bores in the area in which the agency's or public infrastructure contractor's construction is occurring. The agency or public infrastructure contractor shall allow the city to place its facilities in the agency's or public infrastructure contractor's trenches and bores, provided the city incurs a pro-rata share of costs to any increase in cost of the trenching and boring. The city shall be responsible for maintaining its respective facilities buried in the agency's or public infrastructure contractor's trenches and bores under this subsection. 
(d)  Joint trenching. The public rights-of-way have a finite capacity for containing facilities. The city engineer may require an agency or public infrastructure contractor to share trench space to minimize the disruption of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. All facilities shall meet any applicable local, state, and federal clearance and other safety requirements, be adequately grounded and anchored, and meet the provisions of contracts executed between agency or public infrastructure contractor and the other joint user. Agency or public infrastructure contractor may, at its option, correct any attachment, deficiencies and charge the joint user for its costs. 
(e)  Excavation safety. On construction projects in which excavation will exceed a depth of five feet, the agency must have detailed plans and specifications for excavation safety systems. The term "excavation" includes trenches, structural or any construction that has earthen excavation subject to collapse. The excavation safety plan shall be designed in conformance with state law and occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) standards and regulations. 
(f)  Erosion control. The agency shall be responsible for storm water management erosion control that complies with city, state and federal guidelines. All installations shall be in accordance with the design and construction standards adopted by the city, as amended, unless an alternative location has been approved by the city engineer. 
(g)  On-site requirements. Agencies and public infrastructure contractors subject to this article must have a minimum of one English-speaking representative at the site where work is being performed at all times. Additionally, each of agency's or public infrastructure contractor's vehicles shall bear a sign identifying the agency or public infrastructure contractor that owns the vehicles. 
(Ord. No. 2001-54, § 1, 12-11-2001) 
Sec. 102-95. - No directional boring zones. 
    In the city, the public infrastructure must be maintained and protected by all agencies and public infrastructure contractors. The public health, safety and welfare is at risk when damages to water and sewer mains occur. To protect the water and sewer system, no person, agency, or public infrastructure contractor will be allowed to directionally bore within five feet longitudinally with water mains that are larger than 12 inches and sewer mains that are 12 inches or larger unless approved by the city engineer. The installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way or easements will be installed by open excavation to assure the protection of the city's water and sewer system, unless approved by the city engineer. The city has available mapping that identifies such mains. The agency or public infrastructure contractor is responsible for obtaining and using this information in the design of new facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2001-54, § 1, 12-11-2001) 
Sec. 102-96. - Minimizing the impacts of work in the rights-of-way. 
(a)  Noise, dust, debris, hours of work. Each agency and public infrastructure contractor shall conduct work in such a manner as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and occupants of neighboring property. In the performance of the work, the agency or public infrastructure contractor shall take appropriate measures to reduce noise, dust, and unsightly debris. Except in an emergency or as provided in section 102-98, permitted work shall be done between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Permitted work that needs to be performed outside the above work hours must be approved by the city engineer in writing, 24 hours in advance. 
(b)  Trash and construction materials. 
(1)  Each agency and public infrastructure contractor shall maintain the work site so that: 
a.  Trash and construction materials are contained so that they are not blown off of the construction site. 
b.  Trash is removed from a construction site often enough so that it does not become a health, fire, or safety hazard. 
c.  Trash dumpsters and storage or construction trailers are not placed in the street without written approval of the city engineer. 
(2)  Agency or public infrastructure contractor must comply with applicable local, state, and federal regulations concerning trash disposal when working in the public rights-of-way.

Equipment and trucks used during construction, excavation, or work activity shall be cleaned of mud and debris prior to leaving any work site. 
(d)  Protection of trees and landscaping. Each agency and public infrastructure contractor shall protect trees, landscape, and landscape features as required by the city and shall be responsible for supplemental maintenance and watering during construction and until restoration is complete and in accordance with the performance warranty made by the agency or public infrastructure contractor under this article. All protective measures shall be provided at the expense of the agency or public infrastructure contractor. 
(e)  Protection of paved surfaces from equipment damage. Backhoe equipment outriggers shall be fitted with rubber pads whenever outriggers are placed on any paved surface. Tracked vehicles with grousers are not permitted on paved surface unless specific precautions are taken to protect the surface. Agency or public infrastructure contractor shall be responsible for any damage caused to the pavement by the operation of such equipment and shall repair such surfaces. Failure to do so will result in the use of the agency's or public infrastructure contractor's performance warranty/guarantee by the city to repair any damage, and, possibly, the requirement of additional warrantees. 
(f)  Protection of property. Each agency and public infrastructure contractor shall protect from injury any public rights-of-way and adjoining property by providing adequate support and taking other necessary measures. Agency or public infrastructure contractor shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences, or other property likely to be damaged during the work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property resulting from failure to properly protect and carry out work in the public rights-of-way. 
(g)  Clean-up. As the work progresses, all public rights-of-way and private property shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess dirt, rock, and other debris. All clean-up operations shall be done at the expense of the agency or public infrastructure contractor. Agency or public infrastructure contractor shall restore any disturbed area to its original condition. 
(h)  Vehicle parking. Each agency and public infrastructure contractor shall make provisions for employee and construction vehicle parking so that neighborhood parking adjacent to a work site is not impacted.

(d)  Aboveground facilities such as pedestals, switching boxes and similar facilities shall be located no less than three feet from the edge of an alley or the back of street curbs and such that they do not create a physical or visual barrier to vehicles leaving or entering roads, driveway or alleys. They shall also not be located in front of residential lots creating an unreasonable visual or aesthetic impairment for the property owner. Aboveground facilities located in public rights-of-way shall be no larger than six feet wide by four feet six inches high by two feet deep. In the event that an Agency or public infrastructure contractor needs to install aboveground facilities that are larger than such size for traffic signals, streetlights, etc., approval of the city engineer is required. All other such facilities larger than the size previously stated in this subsection shall be considered buildings and must be placed on private property and comply with all requirements of the city's building code, including receipt of a building permit prior to installation. 
(e)  Temporary utilities may be located in nonstandard locations, if written approval of the city engineer is obtained in advance. Subsection (a) above shall govern, if applicable. For purposes of this section, a temporary utility is any facility, as defined, that is installed for a period of not greater than 60 calendar days and is subsequently removed by the responsible owner of the facility. 
(Ord. No. 2001-54, § 1, 12-11-2001) 
Sec. 102-98. - Traffic control. 
(a)  When it is necessary to obstruct traffic for more than four hours, a traffic control plan shall be submitted to the city engineer prior to starting construction, except in an emergency.

(b)  All damage caused directly or indirectly to the street surface or subsurface outside the pavement cut area shall be regarded as a part of the street cut. These areas, as established by the city inspector, will be included in the total area repaired. 
(c)  The agency or public infrastructure contractor shall notify the public works department immediately of any damage to other utilities, either city-owned or privately-owned. 
(d)  Construction standards and methods: 
(1)  The design and construction standards adopted by the city, as amended, shall govern the cutting and restoration of street and alley pavements in the city. These requirements shall apply equally to any person, public infrastructure contractor, agency or city department who makes cuts and repairs to streets and alleys in the city. 
(2)  Permanent repairs of utility cuts in existing streets, alleys or easements will be completed by the agency or public infrastructure contractor within 14 calendar days of beginning the work. If an agency or public infrastructure contractor does not believe that it will be able to meet this schedule, the agency or public infrastructure contractor must contact the city engineer concerning an alternative schedule for the repairs. Any alternative schedule must be approved by the city engineer prior to the beginning of the work. The agency or public infrastructure contractor will be responsible for any maintenance of the repair for a period of one year after the repair is complete. Failure to do so will result in the use of the agency's or public infrastructure contractor's performance warranty/guarantee by the city to repair any damage, and, possibly, the requirement of additional warrantees and/or the denial of future permits. 
(3)  Steel plates left in the right-of-way after repairs are completed will be removed by the city and become the city's property. 
(4)  Excavation in street or alley pavements should begin with an air-hammer shovel, a pavement breaker or other equipment that will not damage the pavement outside an approximate width of the ditch prior to beginning trenching operations. All street excavations will be saw cut before the street is repaired. Full depth saw cuts are required. 
(5)  If the excavation is to pass under where the curb is installed without dummy/expansion joint, the agency or public infrastructure contractor may saw cut a smooth line one foot beyond each side of the disturbed base. If no damage to curb is evident to the city inspector, the agency or public infrastructure contractor may pump concrete under curb and gutter on cuts less than one foot wide. The city inspector will make this determination prior to concrete being placed under existing curb and gutter.

ARTICLE II. - UTILITY MAIN EXTENSIONS 

Sec. 114-21. - City mains subject to pro rata charges; pro rata fund. 
(a)  All sanitary sewer collection mains and water distribution mains, whose construction is or was funded, in whole or in part, by the city, including existing city facilities, shall be subject to the pro rata charges as detailed in this section. Any person, firm or entity desiring to be connected into such city funded facility shall be required to pay such pro rata charge to the city as provided in this section. 
(b)  All pro rata charges shall be paid to the city and placed into a separate fund to be known as the pro rata fund. The appropriation and dispersal of the monies, paid for the city-funded facilities, in this pro rata fund shall be part of the city's budget process. The monies paid for the benefit of anyone other than the city shall be held and distributed in accordance with section 114-26. 
(Ord. No. 90-5, § 2.00, 3-13-1990; Code 1991, ch. 11, § 11.01; Ord. No. 93-7, § I(11.01), 2-9-1993; Code 1997, § 114-31) 
Sec. 114-22. - Pro rata charges. 
    Whenever a pro rata charge applies under the provisions of this article, it shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  An amount equal to 50 percent of the total cost for the installation of the water or sanitary sewer main at the time the main was constructed, as determined by the city engineer, shall be established. The cost assessment is to be determined from existing cost records maintained by the city with the total cost (construction, engineering and inspection) distributed for the total length of the project on a linear footage basis and the total service area on an acreage basis. Front foot cost is defined as the total cost of the project divided by the total length of the main extension (e.g., $100,000.00 divided by 1,000 L.F. = $10.00/L.F.). Acreage cost is defined as the total cost of the project divided by the service area of the main extension (e.g., $100,000.00 divided by acreage). In no instance shall the front foot cost be less than $7.50 per front foot nor shall the acreage cost be less than $500.00 per acre. The front foot cost and the acreage cost so determined shall then be applied to the area in question and the greater of the front foot or the acreage amount shall be the pro rata charge assessed and payable. 
(2)  All single-family residential lots, areas or tracts of land located at a standard right angle street intersection shall only be charged a pro rata on the shortest street frontage, regardless of the location of the water main or sanitary sewer main or based upon the total acreage of the lots, areas or tracts of land, whichever is greater. 
(3)  Where lots or tracts are intended to be used for apartments, business, commercial or industrial purposes, then the pro rata provided in this section shall be paid on the frontage for each corner of the property abutting a street intersection or based upon the total acreage of the lots or tracts, whichever is greater. 
(4)  On lots, area or tracts of land which extend through from one street to another, with frontage on both streets, and when the average distance of the property lines connecting the street lines is 225 feet or more, then pro rata shall be charged on both frontages or for the total acreage, whichever is greater. 
(Ord. No. 90-5, § 2.01, 3-8-1988; Code 1991, ch. 11, § 11.02; Ord. No. 93-7, § I(11.02), 2-9-1993; Code 1997, § 114-32) 
Sec. 114-23. - For individual property owners. 
(a)  Single-family residential. Main extensions for single-family residences shall be arranged as follows: 
(1)  Upon the request of the owner, or his agent, also referred to in this article as the applicant, on a given lot, the city shall extend, lay or construct all necessary water mains and sanitary sewer lines and their appurtenances the distance across the frontage necessary to provide the service for which the application is made, providing the necessary funds are available. The property owner to be served shall be required to pay the charges provided for in section 114-22(1), at such time as his property is connected to such mains. Where an applicant secures an extension and service under this particular option for main extension, he shall pay the pro rata charges on all property owned by him and which is served by the extension requested. The required extension of main shall be figured in such a manner as to leave out of the calculations that portion of any main adjacent to property already having other than a temporary water service, and for which the pro rata charges thereon have been paid or credited under the terms of this article. 
(2)  If the property seeking a water or sewer connection is not directly adjacent to an existing main, then the applicant shall extend the water main or sanitary sewer line from the nearest standard size existing water main or sanitary sewer line as determined by the engineering department. The extension shall be constructed by the city at the owner's expense and shall be extended across the complete frontage of such area, lot or tract of land seeking the connection when such main extension is located in a street right-of-way, alley or existing easement. If an additional easement is necessary to extend the water main or sanitary sewer line across the lot, area or tract of land, then the owner of the property seeking a connection shall provide the city with an easement as required by the engineering department. The owners of all intervening property served by the given main extension shall be required to pay the pro rata charges as established in section 114-22(1), at such time as their property is connected to such main. 
(b)  Business, industrial, commercial, apartment and property other than single-family residential. Properties other than single-family residential (businesses, industries, commercial concerns, and apartments) shall receive main extensions as follows: 
(1)  When the owner of an area, lot or tract of land zoned other than single-family residential seeks a water or sewer connection and no standard size water mains or sanitary sewer mains are adjacent to, upon or span the complete frontage or distance required across the front of the area, lot or tract of land, the owner shall extend the water main or sanitary sewer main from the nearest standard size existing main as determined by the engineering department. The extension shall be constructed by the owner's contractor, at the owner's expense, and shall be extended across the complete frontage of the area, lot or tract of land when the main extension is located in a street right-of-way, alley or an existing easement. If an additional easement is necessary to extend the water main or sanitary sewer main across the lot, area or tract of land, then the owner of the property seeking a connection shall provide the city with an easement as required by the engineering department. 
(2)  The engineering department shall determine the size of the required main extension in accordance with the city's comprehensive water and sewer plans and shall also determine the location of all necessary appurtenances such as fire hydrants, valves, manholes, cleanouts, and other items which may be necessary for proper operation and use of the water or sewer installation. 
(3)  All proposed water and sanitary sewer installations to be installed by the applicant's contractor shall be designed by a professional civil engineer, registered in the state, and the engineer shall submit to the engineering department three copies of the complete engineering plans for the water or sewer improvements. The engineering department shall review the plans and specifications, and, if approved, the engineering department shall mark them "approved" and return one set to the applicant's engineer. If not approved, one set of the engineering plans shall be marked with the objections noted and returned to the applicant's engineer for correction. The same procedure shall be followed until the engineering plans are approved. After approval of the engineering plans and specifications, the applicant shall cause his contractor to install the water or sewer facilities in accordance with the approved engineering plans and specifications and this article. The applicant shall cause his engineer to design, stake and supervise the construction of such improvements and shall cause his contractor to construct the improvements in accordance with this article. The city will inspect the installation of the improvements. When found to be installed in accordance with the plans and specifications, and after the improvements have been completed and upon receipt by the city of a one-year maintenance bond in the amount of ten percent of the contract price, along with one set of as-built plans, and upon receipt of a certified letter of the contractor's compliance with this article, the engineering department shall forward to the city council to receive and approve the title, use and normal maintenance of the improvements, subject to the provisions of the maintenance bond. 
(4)  When the main installations have been accepted by the city in accordance with the criteria stated in subsections (b)(1)-(b)(3) of this section, the city may agree to refund to the applicant any pro rata collected from other parties, firms or corporations seeking a connection to the water main or sanitary sewer main installed by the applicant. The pro rata shall be collected at the rates established in section 114-22(1). 
(5)  Where extension is requested by an industry or commercial concern using large quantities of water, such extension may be made at the discretion of the city council, provided 40 percent of the estimated annual revenue for such customer will support interest and principal payments on the total cost of the extension required to serve. 
(6)  In lieu of the procedures in subsections (b)(1)-(b)(4) of this section, the city council may consider and determine the necessity for the extension and construction of water and/or sanitary sewer main improvements by providing for the payment of a part of the cost of such improvements by assessments to be made against the benefited property and the owners of such property under the terms and provisions of V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 402.061 et seq., as amended. 
(Ord. No. 90-5, § 2.02, 3-8-1988; Code 1991, ch. 11, § 11.03; Code 1997, § 114-33) 
Sec. 114-24. - For developers and subdividers. 
(a)  Onsite extensions totally within property to be developed. Onsite extensions within the property to be developed shall be made as follows: 
(1)  A developer shall defray the entire cost of water and sewer mains and all appurtenances that lie totally within a subdivision, except that the city will refund the oversize cost as established in section 114-25 of any main larger than 12 inches in diameter, unless such larger size is necessary to serve the developer's property in question. Size of mains necessary for adequate service shall be determined by the engineering department in accordance with the city's comprehensive water and sewer plans. Refunds for oversize cost will be made upon final acceptance of the system by the city, provided the funds are available. 
(b)  Mains along the site. Along-site mains, lying along one or more sides of a subdivided tract and serving property other than the subdivision for which the extensions are made, shall be established as follows: 
(1)  For all water and sanitary sewer mains, the developer will be refunded any collected pro rata in accordance with section 114-22(1), as adjacent property develops. 
(2)  For water and sanitary sewer mains larger than 12 inches in diameter, the developer will be refunded the oversize cost as established in section 114-25 and as adjacent property develops, the developer will be refunded any collected pro rata as established in section 114-22(1). 
(3)  Where along-site mains exist, the developer shall pay to the city a pro rata in the amount as established in section 114-22(1), and such pro rata payments shall be paid before any building permits are issued for any lot, area or parcel of land situated inside the boundaries of the subdivision. 
(c)  Off-site extensions. Off-site extensions, totally outside of property to be developed, shall be established as follows: 
(1)  Off-site water and sewer facilities shall be constructed by private contract at the developer's expense in accordance with the city subdivision regulations and all construction standards and specifications adopted by the city council. 
(2)  Pro rata collections and refunds shall be made in the following manner: 
a.  Water mains. As property adjacent to the water main installation develops and pays all due pro rata in accordance with section 114-22(1), then all pro rata collected by the city shall be refunded to the developer or investor who caused the water installation to be installed. 
b.  Sanitary sewer mains. As property adjacent to the sanitary sewer main installation develops and connects to the sanitary sewer installation and pays all due pro rata in accordance with section 114-22(1), then all pro rata collected by the city shall be refunded to the developer or investor who caused the sanitary sewer installation to be installed. As other property not adjacent to the sanitary sewer installation develops and connects to or produces a flow of sewage, either directly or indirectly, through the sanitary sewer installation, a sanitary sewer acreage pro rata, in the amount determined by the acreage method, shall be collected from the property by the city and shall be refunded to the developer or investor who caused such sanitary sewer installation to be installed. If a single sanitary sewer line has been developed and constructed in more than one section and where more than one developer or investor is involved, then all acreage pro rata collected from property not adjacent to the sanitary sewer installation shall be refunded to the developer or investor who caused the initial section of the sanitary sewer facilities to be installed. At such time when the initial installation has been retired, then all collected pro rata shall be refunded to the developer or investor who caused the installation of the second section. This same procedure shall be followed with any number of developers or investors who caused the sanitary sewer line to be installed. 
(3)  Pro rata charges for service outside the corporate limits of the city shall be determined and set forth in a specific agreement with the municipality or other governmental entity. 
(d)  Mains already in place. Mains in place within the property to be developed shall have extensions established as follows: Should an existing water main or sanitary sewer main lie in a street, alley or easement within a tract of land to be subdivided and developed for resale, before extensions from the city's connections to such line shall be made by a developer, he shall pay to the city the following pro rata: 
(1)  The greater of two times the front foot cost or the acreage cost in accordance with section 114-22. 
(2)  Should such mains lie along the subdivision and serve one side only, then the pro rata shall be assessed in accordance with section 114-22. 
(Code 1991, ch. 11, § 11.04; Code 1997, § 114-34) 
Sec. 114-25. - Determination of city participation in oversize cost. 
    For water and sanitary sewer mains larger than 12 inches in size required by the city to be installed by a developer, the developer will be refunded the difference between the cost of such larger mains and the cost of a 12-inch main, or such larger size as may be necessary to serve the subdivision or development for which extensions are required. To determine this difference in costs generally, actual bid prices shall be used, subject to the city's review for reasonableness. Refunds, subject to the availability of funds, will be made upon acceptance of the main by the city. 
(Ord. No. 90-5, § 2.04, 3-8-1988; Code 1991, ch. 11, § 11.05; Code 1997, § 114-35)

    No final plat for new development shall be released for filing with the appropriate county, or in the cases within Wylie's extraterritorial jurisdiction for which no plat is submitted to Wylie, whether the property is located inside or outside the corporate boundaries of Wylie, no application for a utility connection shall be approved and/or certificate of occupancy shall be issued, without assessment of an impact fee pursuant to this article. No building permit shall be issued, or in the cases within Wylie's extraterritorial jurisdiction for which no plat is submitted to Wylie, utility connection made, for new development, until the property owner has paid the impact fee imposed by and calculated herein or a contract for payment is approved by Wylie and executed by the parties. 
(Ord. No. 2012-18, § 2(Art. 5), 6-12-2012) 
Sec. 114-46. - Assessment of impact fees. 
(a)  The assessment of the impact fee for any new development shall be calculated and made at the time of final plat approval (as defined in section 114-42); however, for the sole purpose of phasing in the application of this article, for complete applications for final plats submitted to the city for consideration, on or before July 12, 2012, pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations and for which no replatting is necessary prior to issuance of a building permit, that are subsequently approved by the city, or for a final plate deemed approved on or before July 12, 2012, due to the city's failure to act, assessment for the new development to which the final plat applies shall be calculated and made in accordance with the impact fees existing on June 11, 2012. 
(b)  Following initial assessment of the impact fee for a new development pursuant to subsection (a), the amount of the impact fee per service unit for that development cannot be increased, unless the approved final plat expires or lapses under applicable ordinances or law or the owner proposes to change the approved development by the submission of a new development application or application to increase the number of service units, in which case the impact fee will be reassessed for increased meter size or additional meters or service units at the impact fee rate then in effect. 
(c)  Following the lapse or expiration of a final plat that has received approval, or a final plat deemed approved due to the city's failure to act, pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations, a new assessment shall be performed at the time of new final plat approval in accordance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 2012-18, § 2(Art. 6), 6-12-2012) 
Sec. 114-47. - Computation and collection of impact fees. 
(a)  The impact fees due on new development shall be collected at the time of application for a building permit or, in the cases within Wylie's extraterritorial jurisdiction for which no plat is submitted to Wylie at the time of application for utility connection, unless an agreement between the developer and the city has been executed providing for a different time of payment. 
(b)  At the time of final plat approval, or the request for a utility connection for an area in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction for which a final plat was not submitted to the city, for all new developments, the city shall compute the impact fees due for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The amount of each type of impact fee due (water and/or wastewater) shall be determined by multiplying the number of each type of service units generated by the new development by the impact fee due for each type of service unit in the applicable service area set forth in exhibits A and/or B, respectively. 
(2)  The amount of each impact fee due shall be reduced by any allowable credits for that category of capital improvements in the manner provided by this article. 
(c)  Whenever a property owner proposes to increase the number of service units for a new development, the additional impact fees collected for such new service units shall be determined by using the amount of impact fee per service unit in exhibits A and/or B then in effect, and such additional fee shall be collected at the time of issuance of a new building permit, or for an area in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction for which a final plat was not required to be submitted to the city, prior to or at the time of enlargement of the connection to the city's water or wastewater system. 
(Ord. No. 2012-18, § 2(Art. 7), 6-12-2012) 
Sec. 114-48. - Credits against impact fees. 
(a)  Any construction or contributions to or dedications of any area-related facility appearing in the capital improvements plan that is required to be constructed by a property owner as a condition of new development shall be credited against the impact fees otherwise due on that new development from the same category (water or wastewater) of impact fees assessed on the new development. 
(b)  All credits against impact fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this article and any additional administrative guidelines that may be adopted by the city. 
(1)  No credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  No credit shall exceed an amount equal to the assessed impact fee. 
(3)  If a credit applicable to a final plat has not been exhausted within ten years from the acquisition of the first building permit issued or, in the cases within Wylie's extraterritorial jurisdiction for which no plat is submitted to Wylie, connection made after the effective date of the adoption of the applicable impact fees, or within such period as may otherwise be designated by contract, such credit shall lapse. 
(4)  In no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer for a credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to city ordinance or for any amount exceeding the total impact fees due for the new development for the category of capital improvement, unless otherwise agreed to by the city. 
(c)  The available credit associated with new development shall be applied against an impact fee in the following manner: 
(1)  For single-family residential lots in a new development consisting only of single-family residential development, such credit shall be prorated equally among such lots, to be applied at the time of application of a building permit for each lot, against impact fees to be collected at the time the building permit is issued. 
(2)  For all other types of new development, including those involving mixed uses, the credit applicable to the new development shall be applied to the impact fee due at the time of approval. 
(3)  At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative credit agreements upon written agreement with the property owner in accordance with the city's administrative guidelines. 
(Ord. No. 2012-18, § 2(Art. 8), 6-12-2012) 
Sec. 114-49. - Establishment of accounts. 
(a)  The city shall establish an account to which interest is allocated for the service area for each type of capital facility for which an impact fee is imposed. Each impact fee collected within the service area shall be deposited in such account. 
(b)  Interest earned on the account into which the impact fees are deposited shall be considered funds of the account and shall be used only in the same manner as which the underlying funds may be used. 
(c)  The city shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to ensure that impact fees disbursed from the accounts are utilized solely for authorized purposes. 
(d)  The city shall maintain and keep financial records for impact fees, which shall show the source and disbursement of all fees collected in or expended within the service area. The records of the account into which impact fees are deposited shall be open for public inspection and copying during ordinary business hours. The city may establish a fee for copying services. 
(Ord. No. 2012-18, § 2(Art. 9), 6-12-2012) 
Sec. 114-50. - Use of proceeds of impact fee accounts. 
(a)  The impact fees collected for the service area may be used to finance or to recoup the costs of any capital improvements or facility expansion identified in the capital improvements plan for the service area, including, but not limited to, the construction contract price, surveying and engineering fees, land acquisition costs (including land purchases, court awards and costs, attorney's fees and expert witness fees). Impact fees may also be used to pay the principal sum and interest and other finance costs on bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance such capital improvements or facility expansion. 
(b)  Impact fees collected pursuant to this article shall not be used to pay for any of the following expenses: 
(1)  Construction, acquisition or expansion of public facilities or assets other than capital improvements or facility expansions identified in the capital improvements plan;

Sec. 114-51. - Refunds. 
(a)  Upon application by an owner of property, any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to city ordinance, which: 
(1)  Has not been expended within ten years from the date of payment; or 
(2)  Existing facilities are available and service is denied; or 
(3)  The city has, after collecting the impact fee when service was not available, failed to commence construction within two years or service is not available within a reasonable period considering the type of improvement or expansion, but in no event later than five years from the date of payment. 
(b)  Payment shall be refunded to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid or, if the impact fee was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of payment to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in the Texas Finance Code, Section 302.002, or its successor statute. The application for refund pursuant to this article shall be submitted within sixty days after the expiration of the ten-year period for expenditure of the fee. An impact fee shall be considered expended on a first-in, first-out basis. 
(c)  An impact fee collected pursuant to this article shall also be considered expended if the total expenditures for capital improvements or facility within the service area within ten years following the date of payment exceed the total fees collected within the service area for such improvements or expansions during such period. 
(d)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), the city shall divide the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(e)  Upon completion of all the capital improvements or facility expansions identified in the capital improvements plan for the service area, the city shall recalculate the impact fee per service unit using the actual costs for the improvements or expansions. If the impact fee per service unit based on actual cost is less than the impact fee per service unit paid, the city shall refund the difference, if such difference exceeds the impact fee paid by more than ten percent. If the difference is less than ten percent, no refund shall be due. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying such difference by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(Ord. No. 2012-18, § 2(Art. 11), 6-12-2012) 
Sec. 114-52. - Updates to plan and revision of fees. 
(a)  The city shall update its land use assumptions and capital improvements plans at least every five years, commencing from the date of adoption of such plans, and shall recalculate the impact fees based thereon in accordance with the procedures set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 395 or in any successor statute. 
(b)  The city may review its land use assumptions, impact fees, capital improvements plans and other factors such as market conditions more frequently than provided in subsection (a) to determine whether the land use assumptions and capital improvements plan should be updated and the impact fee recalculated accordingly, or whether any exhibits hereto should be changed. 
(c)  If, at the time an update is required pursuant to subsection (a), the city council determines that no change to the land use assumptions, capital improvements plan or impact fee is needed, it may dispense with such update by following the procedures in Texas Local Government Code § 395.0575 or its successor statute. 
(d)  In addition to the reviews required by this section, the city shall also conduct the reviews required by section 114-44, impact fees adopted for water and wastewater, above. 
(Ord. No. 2012-18, § 2(Art. 12), 6-12-2012) 
Sec. 114-53. - Use of other financing mechanisms. 
(a)  The city may finance capital improvements or facility expansion designated in the capital improvements plan through the issuance of bonds, through the formation of public utility districts or other assessment districts, or through any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law, in addition to the use of impact fees. 
(b)  Except as herein otherwise provided, the assessment and collection of an impact fee shall be additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other tax, fee, charge or assessment which is lawfully imposed on and due against the property. 
(Ord. No. 2012-18, § 2(Art. 13), 6-12-2012)

State Law reference- Public water suppliers required by rule to develop drought contingency plans, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 26.71. 

Sec. 114-91. - Introduction and objectives. 
(a)  Water supply has always been a key issue in the development of Texas. In recent years, the growing population and economic development of North Central Texas has led to increasing demands for water supplies. At the same time, local and less expensive sources of water supply are largely developed. Additional supplies to meet higher demands will be expensive and difficult to develop. It is therefore important that NTMWD and its member cities and customers make the most efficient use of existing supplies. This will delay the need for new supplies, minimize the environmental impacts associated with developing new supplies, and delay the high cost of additional water supply development. 
    Recognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has developed guidelines and requirements governing the development of water conservation and drought contingency plans for public water suppliers. 1, 2 TCEQ guidelines and requirements are included in Appendix B. The best management practices established by the Water Conservation Implementation Task Force 3 , established pursuant to SB 1094 by the 78th Legislature, were also considered in the development of the water conservation measures. The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) has developed this model water conservation and drought contingency and water emergency response plan for its member cities and customers following TCEQ guidelines and requirements. This model water conservation and drought contingency and water emergency response plan was developed in concert with the NTMWD's water conservation and drought contingency and water emergency response plan. 4 This model water conservation and drought contingency and water emergency response plan replaces the model plans dated August 2004 and April 2006. 
    The water conservation sections of this plan include measures that are intended to result in ongoing, long-term water savings. The drought contingency and water emergency response sections of this plan address strategies designed to temporarily reduce water use in response to specific conditions. 
(b)  The objectives of this model water conservation plan are as follows: 
(1)  To reduce water consumption from the levels that would prevail without conservation efforts. 
(2)  To reduce the loss and waste of water. 
(3)  To improve efficiency in the use of water. 
(4)  To document the level of recycling and reuse in the water supply. 
(5)  To extend the life of current water supplies by reducing the rate of growth in demand. 
(c)  The water conservation plan presented in this document is a model water conservation plan intended for adoption by the NTMWD member cities and customers. In order to adopt this plan, each member city and customer will need to do the following: 
(1)  Complete the water utility profile (provided in Appendix C). 
(2)  Complete the annual water conservation implementation report (in Appendix I). 
(3)  Set five-year and ten-year goals for per capita water use. 
(4)  Adopt ordinance(s) or regulation(s) approving the model plan. 
    The water utility profile, goals, and ordinance(s) or regulations should be provided to NTMWD in draft form for review and comments. Final adopted versions should also be provided to NTMWD, as well as TCEQ. 
    This model plan includes all of the elements required by TCEQ. Some elements of this model plan go beyond TCEQ requirements. Any water supplier wishing to adjust elements of the plan should coordinate with NTMWD. 
    To the extent this model plan conflicts with any other drought contingency plans now existing or in the future adopted by the city, this model plan shall control. 
    All appendices referenced herein are available for review upon request at the office of the City of Wylie Engineer.

    Drought contingency plans. The TCEQ rules governing development of drought contingency plans for public water suppliers are contained in Title 30, Part 1, Chapter 288, Subchapter B, Rule 288.20 of the Texas Administrative Code, a current copy of which is included in Appendix B. For the purpose of these rules, a drought contingency and water emergency response plan is defined as "a strategy or combination of strategies for temporary supply and demand management responses to temporary and potentially recurring water supply shortages and other water supply emergencies." 2

Sec. 114-93. - Drought contingency and water emergency response plan. 
(a)  Introduction. The purpose of this model drought contingency and water emergency response plan is as follows: 
(1)  To conserve the available water supply in times of drought and emergency; 
(2)  To maintain supplies for domestic water use, sanitation, and fire protection; 
(3)  To protect and preserve public health, welfare, and safety; 
(4)  To minimize the adverse impacts of water supply shortages; 
(5)  To minimize the adverse impacts of emergency water supply conditions. 
(b)  The NTMWD supplies treated water to its member cities and customers. This model plan was developed by NTMWD in consultation with its member cities. In order to adopt this model plan, each NTMWD member city and customer will need to adopt ordinance(s) or regulation(s) implementing the plan, including the determination of fines and enforcement procedures. The model plan calls for member cities and customers to adopt drought stages initiated by NTMWD during a drought or water supply emergency. Member cities and customers may also adopt more stringent drought or water emergency response stages than NTMWD if conditions warrant. 
(c)  [Drought defined.] A drought is defined as an extended period of time when an area receives insufficient amounts of rainfall to replenish the water supply causing water supply sources, in this case reservoirs, to be depleted. In the absence of drought response measures, water demands tend to increase during a drought due to the need for additional outdoor irrigation. The severity of a drought depends on the degree of depletion of supplies and on the relationship of demand to available supplies. The NTMWD considers a drought to end when all of its supply reservoirs refill to the conservation storage pool. 
(d)  State requirements for drought contingency and water emergency response plans. This model drought contingency and water emergency response plan is consistent with Texas Commission on Environmental Quality guidelines and requirements for the development of drought contingency plans for public water suppliers contained in Title 30, Part 1, Chapter 288, Subchapter B, Rule 288.20 of the Texas Administrative Code. 2 This rule is contained in Appendix B.

Sec. 114-101. - Introduction and objectives. 
    Water supply has always been a key issue in the development of Texas. In recent years, the increasing population and economic development of North Central Texas have led to growing demands for water supplies. At the same time, local and less expensive sources of water supply are largely already developed. Additional supplies to meet future demands will be expensive and difficult to secure. Severe drought conditions in recent years have highlighted the importance of efficient use of our existing supplies to make them last as long as possible. This will delay the need for new supplies, minimize the environmental impacts associated with developing new supplies, and delay the high cost of additional water supply development. 
    Recognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has developed guidelines and requirements governing the development of water conservation and drought contingency plans for wholesale water suppliers 2 . The TCEQ guidelines and requirements for wholesale suppliers are included in Appendix B. The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) has developed a model water conservation plan pursuant to TCEQ guidelines and requirements. The best management practices established by the Water Conservation Implementation Task Force 3 were also considered in the development of the water conservation measures. 
    The water conservation sections of the NTMWD model plan include measures that are intended to result in ongoing, long-term water savings. This plan replaces the previous plans dated August 2004, April 2006 and March 2008 4 . 
    The objectives of this water conservation plan are as follows: 
(1)  To reduce water consumption from the levels that would prevail without conservation efforts. 
(2)  To reduce the loss and waste of water. 
(3)  To improve efficiency in the use of water. 
(4)  Encourage efficient outdoor water use. 
(5)  To document the level of recycling and reuse in the water supply. 
(6)  To extend the life of current water supplies by reducing the rate of growth in demand. 
    The water conservation plan presented in this document is a model water conservation plan intended for adoption by the NTMWD member cities and customers. In order to adopt this plan, the City of Wylie will need to do the following: 
(1)  Complete the water utility profile (provided in Appendix C). 
(2)  Complete the annual water conservation implementation report (in Appendix J). 
(3)  Set five-year and ten-year goals for per capita water use. 
(4)  Adopt ordinance(s) or regulation(s) approving the model plan. 
The water utility profile, goals, and ordinance(s) or regulations will be provided to NTMWD in draft form for review and comments. Final adopted versions should also be provided to NTMWD, as well as TCEQ. This water conservation plan for the City of Wylie, Texas applies to all users of the City of Wylie water supply. This model plan includes all of the elements required by TCEQ.

(Ord. No. 2014-15 , § 3(Exh. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 114-105. - Specification of water conservation goals. 
    TCEQ rules require the adoption of specific water conservation goals for a water conservation plan. As part of plan adoption, each member city and customer must develop five-year and ten-year goals for per capita municipal use. These goals should be submitted to NTMWD in draft form for review. The goals for this water conservation plan include the following: 
(1)  Maintain the total and residential per capita water use below the specified amount in gallons per capita per day in a dry year, as shown in the completed Table 5-1. 
(2)  Maintain the water loss percentage in the system below 12 percent annually in 2013 and subsequent years, as discussed in section 114-106(a)(3). (The 12 percent goal for water loss is recommended but is not required. Systems with long distances between customers may adopt a higher percent water loss goal.) 
(3)  Implement and maintain a program of universal metering and meter replacement and repair, as discussed in section 114-106(a)(2). 
(4)  Increase efficient water usage through a water conservation ordinance, order or resolution as discussed in section 114-107(e) and Appendix E. (This ordinance is required by the NTMWD.) 
(5)  Decrease waste in lawn irrigation by implementation and enforcement of landscape water management regulations, as discussed in section 114-107(f). (These landscape water management regulations are recommended but are not required.) 
(6)  Raise public awareness of water conservation and encourage responsible public behavior by a public education and information program, as discussed in section 114-106(b). 
(7)  Develop a system specific strategy to conserve water during peak demands, thereby reducing the peak use.

(Ord. No. 2014-15 , § 3(Exh. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 114-106. - Basic water conservation strategies. 
(a)  Metering, water use records, control of water loss, and leak detection and repair . One of the key elements of water conservation is tracking water use and controlling losses through illegal diversions and leaks. It is important to carefully meter water use, detect and repair leaks in the distribution system and provide regular monitoring of real losses. 
(1)  Accurate metering of treated water deliveries from NTMWD . Water deliveries from NTMWD are metered by NTMWD using meters with accuracy of ± percent. These meters are calibrated on a monthly basis by NTMWD to maintain the required accuracy. 
(2)  Metering of customer and public uses and meter testing, repair, and replacement . The provision of water to all customers, including public and governmental users, will continue to be metered by the City of Wylie. The City of Wylie will test and replace their residential customer meters on a regular basis. All residential customer meters will be budgeted and replaced on a minimum of a 15-year cycle. Additionally, large meters will be regularly tested on no less than a five-year interval and either maintained or replaced when their test flow is more than a three percent difference from actual flow. 
(3)  Determination and control of water loss . Total water loss is the difference between water delivered to the City of Wylie from NTMWD (and other supplies, if applicable) and metered water sales to customers plus authorized for use but not sold. (Authorized for use but not sold would include use for firefighting, releases for flushing of lines, uses associated with new construction, etc.) Total water loss includes three categories: 
a.  Apparent losses - including inaccuracies in customer meters. (Customer meters tend to run more slowly as they age and under-report actual use.) Losses due to illegal connections and theft. (Included in Appendix H.) Accounts which are being used but have not yet been added to the billing system. 
b.  Real losses - includes physical losses from the system or mains, reported breaks and leaks, storage overflow. 
c.  Unidentified water losses - (System Input - Total Authorized - Apparent Losses - Real Losses) 
Measures to control water loss will be part of the routine operations of the City of Wylie. Maintenance crews and personnel will look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system. A leak detection and repair program is described in section 114-106(a)(4) below. Meter readers will watch for and report signs of illegal connections, so they can be quickly addressed. 
Total water loss should be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Appendix J. With the measures described in this plan, the City of Wylie should maintain water loss percentage below 12 percent in 2014 and subsequent years. If total water loss exceeds this goal, the City of Wylie will implement a more intensive audit to determine the source(s) of and reduce the water loss. The annual conservation report described below is the primary tool that should be used to monitor water loss. 
(4)  Leak detection and repair . As described above, city crews and personnel should look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system. Areas of the water distribution system in which numerous leaks and line breaks occur should be targeted for replacement as funds are available. 
(5)  Record management system . As required by TAC Title 30, Part 1, Chapter 288, Subchapter A, Rule 288.2(a)(2)(B), the City of Wylie will maintain a record management system that allows for the separation of water sales and uses into residential, commercial, public/institutional, and industrial categories. This information will be included in an annual water conservation report, as described in section 114-107(g) below. 
(b)  Continuing public education and information campaign . The continuing public education and information campaign on water conservation includes the following elements: 
(1)  Utilize the "Water IQ: Know Your Water" and other public education materials produced by the NTMWD. 
(2)  Insert water conservation information with water bills. Inserts will include material developed by member cities' and customers' staff and material obtained from the TWDB, the TCEQ, and other sources. 
(3)  Encourage local media coverage of water conservation issues and the importance of water conservation. 
(4)  Notify local organizations, schools, and civic groups that member city or customer staff and staff of the NTMWD are available to make presentations on the importance of water conservation and ways to save water. 
(5)  Promote the Texas Smartscape web site ( www.txsmartscape.com ) and provide water conservation brochures and other water conservation materials available to the public at city hall and other public places. 
(6)  Make information on water conservation available on its website (if applicable) and include links to the "Water IQ: Know Your Water" website, Texas Smartscape website and to information on water conservation on the TWDB and TCEQ web sites and other resources. 
(7)  NTMWD is an EPA water sense partner and participates in the EPA water sense sponsored "Fix a Leak Week." NTMWD encourages all member cities and customers to become EPA water sense partners. 
(8)  Utilize the "Water My Yard" website and encourage customers to sign-up to receive weekly watering advice. 
(c)  NTMWD system operation plan . The City of Wylie purchases treated water from NTMWD and does not have surface water supplies for which to implement a system operation plan. NTMWD operates multiple sources of water supply as a system. The operation of the reservoir system is intended to optimize the use of the district's sources (within the constraints of existing water rights) while minimizing energy use cost for pumping, maintaining water quality, minimizing potential impacts on recreational users of the reservoirs and fish and wildlife. 
(d)  Coordination with regional water planning group and NTMWD . Appendix F includes a letter sent to the chair of the Region C and Region D water planning group with this model water conservation plan. The City of Wylie will send a copy of their draft ordinance(s) or regulation(s) implementing the plan and their water utility profile to NTMWD for review and comment. The adopted ordinance(s) or regulation(s) and the adopted water utility profile will be sent to the Chair of the appropriate water planning group and to NTMWD. 
(e)  Requirement for water conservation plans by wholesale customers . Every contract for the wholesale sale of water by the City of Wylie that is entered into, renewed, or extended after the adoption of this water conservation plan will include a requirement that the wholesale customer and any wholesale customers of that wholesale customer develop and implement a water conservation plan meeting the requirements of Title 30, Part 1, Chapter 288, Subchapter A, Rule 288.2 of the Texas Administrative Code. The requirement will also extend to each successive wholesale customer in the resale of the water. The City of Wylie does not currently contract for the resale of water to wholesale customers. 
(Ord. No. 2014-15 , § 3(Exh. A), 4-22-2014) 
Sec. 114-107. - Enhanced water conservation strategies. 
(a)  Water rate structure . The City of Wylie will continue to use an increasing block rate water structure that is intended to encourage water conservation and discourage excessive use and waste of water. An example water rate structure suggested by the NTMWD model plan is provided below. The current City of Wylie rate structure is similar to the minimum requirements suggested by the NTMWD. 
(1)  Residential rates . 
a.  Monthly minimum charge . This can (but does not have to) include up to 2,000 gallons water use with no additional charge. 
b.  Base charge per 1,000 gallons up to the approximate average residential use. 
c.  2nd tier (from the average to two times the approximate average) at 1.25 to 2.0 times the base charge. 
d.  3rd tier (above two times the approximate average) at 1.25 to 2.0 times the 2nd tier. 
e.  Additional tiers with further increases if desired. 
f.  The residential rate can also include a lower tier for basic household use up to 4,000 gallons per month or a determined basic use. 
(2)  Commercial/industrial rates . Commercial/industrial rates should include at least 2 tiers, with rates for the 2nd tier at 1.25 to 2.0 times the first tier. Higher water rates for commercial irrigation use are encouraged, but not required. 
(b)  Ordinances, plumbing codes, or rules on water-conserving fixtures . The state has required water-conserving fixtures in new construction and renovations since 1992. The state standards call for flows of no more than 2.5 gallons per minute (gpm) for faucets, 2.5 gpm for showerheads, and 1.6 gallons per flush for toilets. Similar standards are now required nationally under federal law. These state and federal standards assure that all new construction and renovations will use water-conserving fixtures. Rebate programs to encourage replacement of older fixtures with water conservation programs are discussed in section 114-107(h). 
(c)  Reuse and recycling of wastewater . Most member cities and customers do not own and operate their own wastewater treatment plants. Their wastewater is treated by NTMWD. NTMWD currently has the largest wastewater reuse program in the state. NTMWD has water rights allowing reuse of up to 71,882 acre-feet per year of this treated wastewater through Lavon Lake for municipal purposes. In addition, NTMWD has also developed the East Fork Raw Water Supply Project which can divert up to 157,393 acre-feet per year based on treated wastewater discharges by the NTMWD. When fully developed, these two reuse projects will provide up to 44 percent of the NTMWD's currently permitted water supplies. NTMWD also provides treated effluent from its wastewater treatment plants available for direct reuse for landscape irrigation and industrial use. 
Although the City of Wylie does not operate its own wastewater treatment plant, the NTMWD encourages those member cities and customers to move toward reusing treated effluent for irrigation purposes at their plant site over the next three years. These entities should also seek other alternatives for reuse of recycled wastewater effluent. 
(d)  Interactive weather stations/water my yard program . NTMWD has developed the Water My Yard program to install weather stations throughout its service area to provide consumers with a weekly email and information through the water my yard website in determining an adequate amount of supplemental water that is needed to maintain healthy grass in specific locations. This service represents the largest network of weather stations providing ET-based irrigation recommendations in the State of Texas, and provides the public advanced information regarding outdoor irrigation needs, thereby reducing water use. Through a series of selections on the type of irrigation system a consumer has, a weekly email is provided that will determine how long (in minutes) that an irrigation system needs to run based on the past seven days of weather. This recommendation provides the actual amount of supplemental water that is required for a healthy lawn based on research of the Texas A&M Agrilife Extension Service and proven technologies. This innovative program has been available to those within the NTMWD service area since May 2013. 
(e)  Compulsory landscape and water management measures . The following landscape water management measures are adopted for use by this plan. These measures represent minimum measures to be implemented and enforced in order to irrigate the landscape appropriately, and are to remain in effect on a permanent basis unless water resource management stages are declared. 
(1)  Landscape water management measures . 
a.  Limit landscape watering with sprinklers or irrigation systems at each service address to no more than two days per week (April 1 - October 31), with education that less than twice per week is usually adequate. Additional watering of landscape may be provided by hand-held hose with shutoff nozzle, use of dedicated irrigation drip zones, and/or soaker hose provided no runoff occurs. Lawn and landscape watering limited to twice per week as per the chart below: 
Trash Day Watering Days Monday Monday and Thursday Tuesday Tuesday and Friday Wednesday Wednesday and Saturday Thursday Thursday and Sunday Friday Friday and Monday  
b.  Limit landscape watering with sprinklers or irrigation systems at each service address to no more than one day per week beginning November 1 and ending March 31 of each year, with education that less than once per week is usually adequate. The watering day shall be on the customer's trash day unless otherwise set by the City of Wylie. 
c.  Prohibit lawn irrigation watering from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (April 1-October 31). 
d.  Prohibit the use or irrigation systems that water impervious surfaces. (Wind driven water drift will be taken into consideration.) 
e.  Prohibit outdoor watering during precipitation or freeze events. 
f.  Prohibition of use of poorly maintained sprinkler systems that waste water. 
g.  Prohibit excess water runoff or other obvious waste. 
h.  Require rain and freeze sensors and/or ET or Smart controllers on all new irrigation systems. Rain and freeze sensors and/or ET or Smart controllers must be maintained to function properly. 
i.  Prohibit watering of areas that have been overseeded, sodded, sprigged, broadcasted or plugged with cool season grasses, except for golf courses and athletic fields. 
j.  Requirement that all new irrigation systems be in compliance with state design and installation regulations (TAC Title 30, Part 1, Chapter 344). 
(2)  Additional water management measures . 
a.  Prohibit the use of potable water to fill or refill residential, amenity, and any other natural or manmade ponds. A pond is considered to be a still body of water with a surface area of 500 square feet or more. 
b.  Noncommercial car washing can be done only when using a water hose with a shut-off nozzle. 
c.  Hotels and motels may offer a linen reuse water conservation option to customers. 
d.  Restaurants, bars, and other commercial food or beverage establishments may choose to provide drinking water to customers when a specific request is made by the customer for drinking water. 
Member cities and customers are responsible for developing regulations, ordinances, policies, or procedures for enforcement of water conservation guidelines. 
Appendix E is a summary of considerations for landscape water management regulations adopted as part of the development of this water conservation plan. These regulations are intended to minimize waste in landscape irrigation. Appendix E includes the required landscape water measures in this section. 
(f)  Additional water conservation measures . In addition the City of Wylie adopts the following conservation measures as part of its plan: 
(1)  Landscape water management regulations . 
a.  Recommend that all existing irrigation systems be retrofitted with rain and freeze sensors and/or ET or Smart controllers capable of multiple programming. Rain and freeze sensors and/or ET or Smart controllers must be maintained to function properly. 
b.  Recommend no planting of cool-season grasses (such as rye and other similar grasses) that intensify cool-season watering requirements with exception allowed for golf courses and public athletic fields. 
c.  Requirement that all new athletic fields be irrigated by a separate irrigation system from surrounding areas. 
d.  Implementation of other measures to encourage off-peak water use. 
(2)  Landscape ordinance . Landscape ordinances are developed by cities to guide developers in landscaping requirements for the city. A sample landscape ordinance is provided in Appendix I and is intended as a guideline for adopting a landscape ordinance to promote water efficient landscape design. 
a.  Native, drought tolerant or adaptive plants should be encouraged. 
b.  Drip irrigation systems should be promoted. 
c.  ET/Smart controllers that only allow sprinkler systems to irrigate when necessary should be promoted. 
(3)  Water audits . Water audits are useful in finding ways in which water can be used more efficiently at a specific location. NTMWD recommends that member cities and customers offer water audits to customers if funding is available. 
(4)  Rebates . 
a.  In addition to the conservation measures described above, the NTMWD also recommends the following water conservation incentive programs for consideration by member cities and customers if funds are available: 
1.  Low-flow toilet replacement and rebate programs, 
2.  Rebates for rain/freeze sensors and/or ET or Smart controllers, 
3.  Low-flow showerhead and sink aerators replacement programs or rebates, 
4.  Water efficient clothes washer rebates, 
5.  Pressure reducing valve installation programs or rebates, 
6.  Rain barrel rebates, 
7.  Pool covers, 
8.  On-demand hot water heater rebates, and/or 
9.  Other water conservation incentive programs. 
(g)  Monitoring of effectiveness and efficiency-Annual water conservation report . Appendix D is a form that should be used in the development of an annual water conservation report by the City of Wylie. This form should be completed by March 31 of the following year and used to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of the water conservation program and to plan conservation-related activities for the next year. The form records the water use by category, per capita municipal use, and total water loss for the current year and compares them to historical values. As part of the development of Appendix D, the City of Wylie will complete the tracking tool by March 31 of the following year and submit it to NTWMD. 
(h)  Water conservation implementation report . Appendix J includes the TCEQ-required water conservation implementation report. The report is due to the TCEQ by May 1 of every year. This report lists the various water conservation strategies that have been implemented, including the date the strategy was implemented. The report also calls for the five-year and ten-year per capita water use goals from the previous water conservation plan.

    It shall be the duty of the city secretary to notify the owner or occupant of every building situated where there has been laid a sanitary sewer main within 500 feet of such building to make a sanitary sewer connection with the city sanitary sewer within 90 days after having been so notified by the city secretary. Any such owner or occupant of any building so situated who shall fail to make such connection with the city sanitary sewer system shall have any city water service to such building disconnected, and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the fine provided in section 1-9. 
(Ord. No. 90-9, § 2, 8-14-1990; Code 1991, ch. 11, § 18.02; Code 1997, § 114-147) 
Sec. 114-113. - Contract for replacement of sanitation sewer lateral. 
(a)  The city may contract for the replacement of a sanitation sewer lateral on a septic system that serves a residential structure on private property in order to connect the lateral to a new, renovated or rebuilt sanitation main constructed by the city. The city shall assess the cost of the replacement of the lateral against the property on which the lateral is located. A lien attaches to the property for the cost of the replacement. 
(b)  Before a contract may be entered into, the city must obtain the property owner's written consent to the contract for replacement and to the assessment. The written contract must state that the person giving the consent is the property owner or the authorized representative of the property owner, must state the owner's address, and must state that the consent is freely given, that the owner understands that as a result of the assessment, a lien attaches to the property for the total cost of the replacement, that the city will not pay any part of the replacement cost, and that the owner has five years from the date the work is completed to repay the cost to the city. 
(c)  Before the contract is entered into but after the city has received bids or a cost estimate for the work, the city must give notice to the property owner as to the cost or price accepted by the city for completion of the work, and that contract price may not be increased by more than ten percent because of changes without the written consent of the owner. The notice shall be given to the owner by personal delivery or by depositing the notice in the mail, postage prepaid, to the owner at the address in the owner's written consent. 
(d)  The city shall contract for the performance of the work or shall perform the work with city forces. 
(e)  Unless the owner waives the right to reject the contract as provided in this section on or before the 45th day after the date of notice, the owner may reject the contract by notifying the city secretary of the withdrawal of consent. If the owner withdraws consent, he shall be required to make the connection himself under the provisions of this article. If the owner fails to withdraw the consent during the 45-day period, the city may perform or contract for the performance of the work, the work may proceed, and the assessment may be made without further consent by the owner. After such 45-day period, the owner may not withdraw the consent. 
(f)  The owner may waive the right to reject the contract by filing a sworn affidavit to that effect with the city secretary. After the affidavit is filed, the city may contract for or perform the work, the work may proceed, and the assessment may be made without further consent by the owner. 
(g)  When the work has been completed and accepted, the city may pay the contractor the cost of the completed work. 
(h)  When payment is made, the city shall issue a certificate certifying the work has been completed and that payment has been made for costs expended under the contract. The city shall file the certificate with the county clerk in which the property is located and shall deliver a copy of the certificate to the property owner. 
(i)  The property owner, within five years after the date of issuance of the certificate, must pay the city the amount that the city paid for the completed work as evidenced by the certificate, plus simple interest in an amount not to exceed ten percent per year. The contract shall specify the payment terms, and on payment of the principal amount and all accrued interest, the city shall issue a release of the assessment and lien which may be filed of record as provided by law. 
(j)  If the property owner does not pay the assessment during the five-year period, as provided by the contract, the city may declare the contract in default and enforce the lien on the property in the same manner in which it is authorized by law to enforce the lien for paving or other assessment. 
(Ord. No. 90-9, § 3, 8-14-1990; Code 1991, ch. 11, § 18.03; Code 1997, § 114-148)

DIVISION 2. - LIFT STATION DISTRICTS 

Sec. 114-131. - Established; fees; extensions; records of monies. 
(a)  The city is hereby empowered to establish, define and amend sanitary sewer lift station districts for the provision of sanitary sewage collection for the current city limits and future expansion within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. These lift station districts shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city council, they are necessary in order to promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and those people impacted by such decisions within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
(b)  These districts shall be established in such a fashion as to make maximum use of existing topographic drainage basin and to provide for a minimum number of eventual lift stations to serve the needs of the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
(c)  Districts may be created encompassing land that lies both within the city limits and outside the city limits at the time the district is created. This is necessary in order to ensure for proper future planning and maximum utilization. Fees that may be prescribed for a particular district will be collected at the time of development based upon the level of development. Subsequent fees may be charged if eventual development exceeds the initial amount paid for scope of development. Land area within the extraterritorial jurisdiction will be assumed to be part of a particular lift station district, and fees from such areas shall be due at the time service and annexation is requested. 
(d)  All lift station districts shall be established, unless specifically noted in the creation of such districts, to be based upon a gravity flow system to the city's lift station. Developers and individuals desiring to connect to the system shall pay their established fee for the district in which their property is designated. The payment of this fee shall entitle the developer/individual to connect to the existing system at an anticipated flow determined by the development and the payment of the fee. The monies thus collected shall go to the construction, placement, engineering and general provision of the lift station facility and its necessary appurtenances. The developer/individual may, in addition, be required to extend a connecting line between his property and the available connection point. Such extension shall be at his own expense and separate from the collection of the lift station fee or any other fee. In addition, some developers or individuals may be required to pay the cost of continuing through their property a general collection line for the purposes of routing the sewage to the lift station complex. 
(e)  The city shall keep accurate records of all monies collected and expended for each lift station district. Such monies shall be audited annually as part of the city's regular audit procedure. The city may use money collected from one district to start, upgrade or complete the lift station in another district in order to respond to a changing development pattern. In such case, those monies shall be returned to the original lift station district account upon collection as a result of ultimate development.

Any significant industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging nondomestic wastes into the sanitary sewer system must obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior to beginning or recommencing such discharge. For categorical industrial users, a baseline monitoring report (see section 114-159) will be used as an application for this permit and must be filed at least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge. For noncategorical industrial users, a permit application must be filed in accordance with section 114-164. 
(f)  Reapplication. Once permitted, the industrial user has the duty to reapply if the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by the permit after the expiration date of the permit. The industrial user must submit an application for a new permit at least 90 days before the expiration of the permit in accordance with section 114-164. The application form may be obtained from the control authority. 
(Ord. No. 92-6, § 7, 6-23-1992; Code 1997, § 114-223) 
Sec. 114-159. - Baseline monitoring report. 
    Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in subsections (1)-(7) of this section. Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the director or the regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140(b)(1977), the industrial user will not be required to submit this information again. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in subsections (1)-(5) of this section. New sources shall also be required to include this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections (4) and (5) of this section. 
(1)  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operators and owners. 
(2)  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility.

The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and the standard industrial classification of the operations carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
(4)  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
a.  Regulated process streams; and 
b.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
The control authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants. Pollutants shall be measured as follows: 
a.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
b.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass), where required by the standard or control authority, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
c.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The control authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
d.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. 
e.  Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR. 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority. 
f.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator. 
g.  The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline monitoring report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
h.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(6)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in section 114-166), and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
a.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by this section, the information required by subsections (6) and (7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits. 
b.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) after the user submits the report required by this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by subsections (6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the user to the control authority within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.

(Ord. No. 92-6, § 27, 6-23-1992; Code 1997, § 114-243) 
Sec. 114-179. - Bypass. 
(a)  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(b)  Notice. Notice of a bypass shall be submitted by industrial users as follows: 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, if possible, at least ten days before the date of the bypass. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the control authority within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(c)  Prohibition of bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
(2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
(3)  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (b) of this section. 
The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three conditions in this subsection (c).

Sec. 114-82. - Upsets; affirmative defense. 
(a)  Certain upsets not considered violations. If a person can establish that an event, which would otherwise be a violation of this division, an industrial user wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant to this division, or other federal, state, or local law, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation. 
(b)  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of affirmative defense. An industrial user who wishes to establish an affirmative defense shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operation logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  The event that resulted in a violation occurred and the Industrial User can identify the cause(s) of the violation as being solely an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the environmental officer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation (if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days); 
a.  A description of the event that resulted in a violation and the cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
c.  Steps being taken and/or plans to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(c)  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish an affirmative defense shall have the burden of proof. 
(d)  Reviewability of agency consideration. In the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the environmental officer will review any claims of an affirmative defense. No determinations made in the course of his/her review shall constitute final action subject to judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of an affirmative defense only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(e)  User responsibility. The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

(a)  Industrial users shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste, as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. Industrial users shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d) and (e). 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of section 114-181 during a calendar month in which the discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional information. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under section 114-181, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

ZONING ORDINANCE
SECTION 2.2 ZONING DISTRICT MAP
A. Adoption of the Official Zoning District Map
The boundaries of each zoning district are delineated and shown on the official Zoning
District Map of the City of Wylie. The official Zoning District Map, together with all
notations, references, dimensions, designations and other information shown on the map, is
adopted and made part of this ordinance, as amended, by reference. The official Zoning
District Map shall be stored, maintained, and kept current by the Department.
B. Amendments
No change to the official Zoning District Map shall be authorized without the approval of a
rezoning application. The application shall be processed in accordance with the requirements
of Article 8 Development Review Procedures of this ordinance, as amended. No change to
the official Zoning District Map shall be authorized or become effective without final action

accepted for filing unless annexation of the property for which the zoning is sought has been
completed.
C. Consistency with Comprehensive Master Plan
No amendment or rezoning shall be approved unless it is consistent with the goals, objectives
and policies of the Comprehensive Master Plan.
SECTION 2.3 RULES FOR INTERPRETING ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
A. Boundary Rules
The following rules shall apply in determining uncertain boundaries of a district as shown on
the official Zoning District Map:
1. Where a boundary follows a public street or alley, the centerline of the street shall be the
boundary.
2. Where a boundary follows a platted lot line, the lot line shall be the boundary.
3. Where a boundary follows a city limit line, the city limit line shall be the boundary.
4. Where a boundary follows a railroad or utility line, the boundary is the established center
line of the railroad or utility right-of-way. If no centerline is established, the boundary is
midway between the right-of-way lines.
5. Where a boundary follows the centerline of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or other bodies
of water, the boundary is the centerline. The centerline is interpreted as being midway
between the shorelines of the body of water. If the centerline changes, the boundaries are
construed as moving with the centerline.
6. In cases where district boundary lines are indicated as approximately paralleling a street,
alley, right-of-way, easement line or other feature existing at the time of the enactment of
this ordinance, as amended, they shall be construed as parallel to or extensions of the
street, alley, right-of-way, easement line, or other feature, unless otherwise specifically
dimensioned on the official Zoning District Map.
ARTICLE 2: DISTRICTS & Z1O5NING DISTRICT MAP
ZONING ORDINANCE
7. In instances where district boundary lines divide a parcel of unsubdivided property, the
precise location of the district boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale
appearing on the official Zoning District Map, unless the boundary is indicated by a
specific dimension on the official Zoning District Map.
8. Where any public right-of-way is officially vacated or abandoned, the land use district
regulations applied to abutting property shall extend to the former centerline of the
vacated or abandoned right-of-way.
B. Determination and Appeal
The Director shall determine the location of the district boundary when uncertainty of
boundaries exist that cannot be resolved by referencing A. Boundary Rules, above. Any
person who is aggrieved by that determination may appeal to the Council. Appeals shall be
made in writing to the Director within 10 days of the decision.
SECTION 2.4 TEMPORARY ZONING, ANNEXED TERRITORY
A. Annexed Territory
All territory annexed into the city shall be temporarily classified as A/30 (Agricultural
District), until permanent zoning is established by the Council. The procedure for
establishing permanent zoning on annexed territory shall conform to the procedure
established by law for the adoption of original zoning regulations.
B. Temporary Agricultural Rules
In an area temporarily classified as A/30 (Agricultural District):
1. No person shall erect, construct or proceed or continue with the erection or construction
of any building or structure in any newly annexed territory without first applying for and
obtaining a building permit or certificate of occupancy from the Building Official or the
Council as may be required.
2. No permit for the construction of a building or use of land shall be issued by the Building
Official other than a permit which will allow the construction of a building permitted in
the A/30 (Agricultural District), unless and until such territory has been classified in a
zoning district other than the A/30 (Agricultural District) by the Council in the manner
prescribed by law except as provided in 3 below.
3. An application for a permit for any other use than that specified in 2, above, shall be
made to the Building Official and referred to the Commission for consideration and
recommendation to the Council. The action and recommendation of each body
concerning the permit shall take into consideration the appropriate land use for the area.

require additional review to ensure compatibility between uses.
B. Special Use Permit Required
The Use Regulations in Section 5.1 Land Use Charts state when a Special Use Permit is
required for a use to be permitted in a zoning district. The Special Use Permit requirement for
a use in a district does not constitute an authorization or an assurance that the use will be

property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as the findings indicate
appropriate.
C. Application

include, but are not limited to the location, arrangement, operation, duration, and type and
manner of construction of any use for which a Special Use Permit is requested.
G. Effect of Special Use Permit.

Special Use Permit unless a time limit that has been established runs out.
H. Zoning Map
When the Council authorizes granting of a Special Use Permit, the zoning map shall be amended
according to its legend to indicate that the affected area has conditional and limited uses. The
amendment is to indicate the appropriate zoning district for the approved use and shall be

designated on the zoning district map by an FP prefix shall be subject to the following
regulations and procedures.
B. Designation of Land Subject to Flooding
The Director shall prepare and maintain maps illustrating all areas designated with the FP
prefix. The designation of land subject to flooding shall be based on:
1. Areas of special hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on its
flood hazard boundary maps (FHBM) for the City of Wylie as provided in Section 50-36
of the Wylie City Code.
2. Areas of special flood hazard as determined by a flood plain or drainage analysis that uses
the application of standard and acceptable scientific and engineering procedures used in
the study of rainfall potential and its effect on a given drainage basin in the form of
flooding.
3. When two or more studies have been completed for the same drainage basin, the more
restrictive of these studies shall be the basis for regulation under this article.

permit within an area designated with a floodplain FP prefix.
a. The proposed development or alteration of the floodplain area will not increase the
severity of flooding up or down stream from the altered property;
b. The proposed development or alteration of the floodplain area will not endanger the
value and safety of other property or the public health and welfare; and
c. The proposed development or alteration of the floodplain area will not endanger the
safety of the property being altered.
E. Removal of Designation
An area may be removed from the floodplain, FP, prefix designation by Council action based
on:
1. A floodplain analysis meeting standard and acceptable scientific and engineering
procedures used in the study of rainfall potential and its effect on a given drainage basin in
the form of flooding, accepted by the City Engineer, that finds the area not subject to
flooding.

SECTION 7.7 LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS
A. Purpose
The process of urban development with its alteration of the natural topography, vegetation,
and creation of impervious cover can have a negative effect on the ecological balance of an
area by causing increases in air temperatures and accelerating the processes of runoff,
erosion, and sedimentation. The economic base of the City can and should be protected
through the preservation and enhancement of its unique natural beauty, environment, and
vegetative space. This section has the following specific purposes:
1. To implement the Wylie Comprehensive Plan.
2. To aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the
processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, and (storm
water) runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare and heat
abatement.
3. To insure that landscaping is an integral part of development, not an afterthought.
4. To provide visual buffering between land uses of differing character to alleviate the
harshness of urban life.
5. To enhance the beautification of the City.
6. To safeguard and enhance property values and to protect public and private investments.
7. To preserve and protect the unique identity and environment of the City of Wylie and
preserve the economic base attracted to the City of Wylie because of these qualities.

SECTION 7.9 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
A. Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to provide for uniform environmental performance standards
for the control of noise, humidity and heat, and vibration in recognition that:
1. The quality of life in a community is enhanced when free from the nuisances created by
these environmental conditions;
2. The excessive exposure to these environmental conditions can adversely affect the health
and safety of the citizens of the City; and
3. Addressing these environmental issues at the plat and site plan review stage is more
effective than waiting until individual citizens have to complain of adverse impacts and
therefore contributes to the general welfare of the community.
B. Noise
1. General Provisions
a. It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully make, cause to be made, or continued
any unreasonable noise within the City.

(2) Within 25 feet of the noise source when the noise source is within a vehicle or
on the public right-of-way; or
(3) Through the common wall in a multifamily building.
c. Areas around schools, institutions of learning, churches or courts while the facilities
are in use, or hospitals, nursing homes, or homes for the aged are especially sensitive
to noise. When provided with conspicuous signs displayed on adjacent or surrounding
streets an area containing one of these uses shall be declared a Quiet Zone.

by both the Commission and the Council. The administrative procedures and requirements
of this ordinance, with regard to Commission consideration and action, on concept plans,

variance from the terms of this ordinance.
2. Variances Based on Hardship. The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal
in specific cases a variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the
public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions
of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this ordinance
shall be observed and substantial justice done, including the following:
a. Permit a variance in the yard requirements of any district where there are unusual and
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of these provisions
due to an irregular shape of the lot, topographical or other conditions, provided the
variance will not seriously affect any adjoining property or the general welfare.
b. Authorize upon appeal, whenever a property owner can show that a strict application
of the terms of this ordinance relating to the construction or alterations of buildings or
structures will impose upon him or her unusual and practical difficulties or particular
ARTICLE 8: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES
ZONING ORDINANCE
hardship, such variances from the strict application of the terms of this ordinance as are
in harmony with its general purpose and intent, but only when the Board is satisfied
that a granting of the variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant,
but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship or difficulty so great as to
warrant a variance from the standards or regulations established by this ordinance and,
at the same time, the surrounding property will be properly protected.
3. Submittal Requirements. A written application for variance shall be submitted with a fee,
accompanied by an accurate legal description, maps, site plans, drawings and any necessary
data, demonstrating:
a. That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure

applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the
terms of this ordinance.

applicant.

privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures or buildings in the
same district.

a. The Board shall not grant a variance to the development code which:
(1) Permits a land use not allowed in the zoning district in which the property is
located; or
(2) Is in the public right-of-way or on public property; or
(3) Alters any definition of the development code; or
(4) Is other than the minimum variance that will afford relief with the least
modification possible to the requirements of the development code; or
(5) Is based on physical conditions or circumstances of the property so general or
recurring in nature as to reasonably make practicable the formulation of a general
regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the development code; or
(6) Is based exclusively on findings of personal or financial hardship.
b. In order to grant a variance to the development code the Board shall find that all the
following have been satisfied:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions of the lot, or other
exceptional physical condition particular to the affected property;
(2) That because of these unique physical circumstances or conditions, the property
cannot be reasonably developed or used in compliance with the provisions of the
development code;
ARTICLE 8: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES
ZONING ORDINANCE
(3) That due to such unique physical circumstances or conditions, the strict
application of the development code would create a demonstrated hardship;
(4) That the demonstrable hardship is not self-imposed;
(5) That the variance if granted will not adversely affect the proposed development
or use of adjacent property or neighborhood;
(6) That the variance, if granted will not change the character of the zoning district
in which the property is located;

and

of the citizens of Wylie.

the existing area of the nonconforming structure or any nonconforming use therein. This
ordinance shall never be construed to allow an addition to a nonconforming structure.

The right to operate a nonconforming use shall cease and the use shall be terminated under any
of the following circumstances:
A. When the use is discontinued or abandoned. Discontinuance of a nonconforming use shall
consist of the intent of the user or owner to discontinue a nonconforming use and the actual
act of discontinuance. A legal nonconforming use, when discontinued or abandoned, shall
not be resumed.
B. The following shall constitute prima facie evidence of discontinuance or abandonment:
1. When land used for a legal nonconforming use shall cease to be used in such manner for
a period of six (6) months; or
2. When a building or other structure designed or used for a nonconforming use shall cease
to be used in such manner for a period of six (6) months.
3. Any nonconforming use which does not involve a permanent structure and which is
moved from the premises shall be considered to have been abandoned.
C. When any provision of this ordinance or any other ordinance, or Federal or State Statute is

used if the expense of such restoration exceeds seventy-five (75) percent of the
repair/replacement cost of the structure at the time such damage occurred. Whenever a
nonconforming structure is damaged in excess of seventy-five (75) percent of its replacement
cost at that time, the repair or reconstruction of such structure shall conform to all the
regulations of the district in which it is located, and it shall be treated as a new structure. A
restoration or reconstruction in violation of this ordinance immediately terminates the right to
operate the nonconforming use or occupy the nonconforming structure.
SECTION 9.7 TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USES BY THE BOARD
The Board may from time to time on its own motion or upon cause presented by interested
persons inquire into the existence, continuation or maintenance of any nonconforming use
within the City. The Board may take specific action to abate, remove, limit or terminate any
nonconforming use under a plan where the owner's actual investment in the use prior to the time
ARTICLE 9: NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 213
ZONING ORDINANCE
that the use became nonconforming can be amortized within a definite time period. The
following factors must be considered by the board in determining a reasonable amortization
period:
A. The owner's capital investment in the structures on the property at the time the use became
nonconforming.
B. The amount of the investment realized to date and the amount remaining, if any, to be
recovered during the amortization period.
C. The life expectancy of the investment.
D. The existence or nonexistence of lease obligations, as well as any contingency clauses therein
permitting termination of such leases.
E. Removal costs that are directly attributable to the establishment of a termination date, and
F. Other costs and expenses that are directly attributable to the establishment of a termination
date.
SECTION 9.8 CHANGING NONCONFORMING USES
A. A lawful nonconforming use of a structure or building may be extended throughout such
portions of the buildings as are arranged or designed for such use, provided no structural
alterations, except those required and allowed by law or ordinance, are made therein. If no
structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a structure or building may be
changed to another nonconforming use of a more restrictive classification, after approval by
the Board, but where the use of a nonconforming structure, land or building is hereafter
changed to a more restricted classification, it shall not thereafter be changed to a use of less
restricted classification. If a nonconforming use of a structure, land or building is terminated,
whether voluntarily or otherwise, the future use of such structure, land or building shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
B. No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use that requires more
off-street parking facilities or off-street loading spaces than the original nonconforming use
unless additional off- street parking facilities and loading spaces are provided so as to comply
with the requirements of this ordinance.
C. A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, may not be changed back to a
nonconforming use.
SECTION 9.9 RESTORATION OF A DAMAGED PROPERTY HOUSING A OWNEROCCUPIED,
NONCONFORMING SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL
STRUCTURE
A. Owner Occupied Single-Family Residential Property. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent
the restoration of an owner occupied single-family residential structure which has been
destroyed to any extent by fire, explosion or other casualty or act of God or a public enemy,
nor to prevent the continued occupancy or use of such building or part of the building which
existed at the time of partial destruction, provided that the building permit for the
reconstruction is applied for within six months of the destruction and the reconstruction is
ARTICLE 9: NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
214
ZONING ORDINANCE
completed within one year of the date of permit issuance. The continued occupancy shall be
conditioned upon compliance with and subject to applicable health and safety regulations.
B. The structure can only be restored or reconstructed so as to have the same height and floor
area that it had immediately prior to the damage or destruction.
C. The property owner has the burden of proof to establish the height and floor area of the
structure immediately prior to the damage or destruction.
SECTION 9.10 RECONSTRUCTION, ENLARGEMENT, AND REPAIR OF
NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A. If a nonconforming structure is partially damaged or destroyed, meaning the expense of such
restoration does not exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the repair/replacement cost of the
structure at the time such damage occurred, other than by the intentional act of the owner or
the owner's agent, or is damaged to the extent that it shall be impractical to repair the existing
structure and demolition is required, the owner or owner's agent may restore or reconstruct
the structure on the existing foundation without Board approval, if:
1. The work does not increase the degree of nonconformity existing prior to such damage,
destruction or demolition; and
2. Reconstruction is started within one year of the event damaging or destroying the
structure. The Board may extend the one-year time period, if the owner shows that he has
intended to rebuild the property.
B. The property owner has the burden of proof to establish the height and floor area of the
structure immediately prior to the damage or destruction.

I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1.1: Authority; Extension to Extraterritorial Jurisdiction
A. This Ordinance is adopted under the authority of the Constitution and laws of the State of
Texas, including Chapter 212, Texas Local Government Code, being adopted after a public
hearing on the matter held on February 25, 2003.
B. The following rules and regulations are hereby adopted as the Subdivision Ordinance of the
City of Wylie, Texas, also referred to herein as "this Ordinance". The City Council hereby
extends the application of this Ordinance to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of
Wylie, as that area may exist from time to time. This Ordinance shall be applicable to the
filing of plats and the subdivision of land, as that term is defined herein and in Chapter 212
of the Texas Local Government Code, within the corporate limits of the City of Wylie and
its extraterritorial jurisdiction as they may be from time to time adjusted by annexation or
disannexation. The City shall have all remedies and rights provided by said Chapter 212
with regard to the control and approval of subdivisions and plats both within the City and
within its extraterritorial jurisdiction.
Section 1.2: Interpretation and Purpose
In the interpretation and application of the provisions of this Ordinance, it is the intention of the
City Council that the principles, standards and requirements provided for herein shall be
minimum requirements for the platting and developing of subdivisions within the City of Wylie
and its extraterritorial jurisdiction.
The subdivision of land is the first step in the process of development. The distribution and
relationship of residential, nonresidential and agricultural uses throughout the community, along
with the system of improvements for thoroughfares, utilities, public facilities and community
amenities, determine, in large measure, the quality of life enjoyed by the residents of the
community. Health, safety, economy, amenities, environmental sensitivity, and convenience are
all factors, which influence and determine a community's quality of life and overall character. A
community's quality of life is of the public interest. Consequently, the subdivision of land, as it
affects a community's quality of life, is an activity where regulation is a valid function of
municipal government. The regulations contained herein are intended to encourage the
development of a quality municipal environment by establishing standards for the provision of
adequate light, air, open space, storm water drainage, transportation, public utilities and facilities,
and other needs necessary for ensuring the creation and continuance of a healthy, attractive, safe
and efficient community that provides for the conservation, enhancement and protection of its
human and natural resources.

Through the application of these regulations, the interests of the public, as well as those of public
and private parties, both present and future, having interest in property affected by this
Ordinance, are protected by the granting of certain rights and privileges. By establishing a fair
and rational procedure for developing land, the requirements in this Ordinance further the
possibility that land will be developed for its most beneficial use in accordance with desired
social, economic and environmental conditions.
The procedure and standards for the development, layout and design of subdivisions of land
within the corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Wylie, Texas are
intended to:
A. Promote the development and the utilization of land in a sustainable manner that assures an
attractive and high quality community environment in accordance with the Comprehensive
Plan and the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Wylie;
B. Guide and assist property owners and applicants in the correct procedures to be followed,
and to inform them of the standards which shall be required;
C. Protect the public interest by imposing standards for the location, design, class and type of
streets, walkways (sidewalks), alleys, utilities and essential public services;
D. Assist orderly, efficient and coordinated development within the City limits and
extraterritorial jurisdiction;
E. Provide neighborhood conservation and prevent the development of slums and blight;
F. Integrate the development of various tracts of land into the existing community, and
coordinate the future development of adjoining tracts;
G. Provide that the cost of improvements to minimum standards which primarily benefit the
tract of land being developed be borne by the owners or developers of the tract, and that the
cost of improvements to minimum standards which primarily benefit the whole community
be borne by the whole community as contained in this Ordinance;
H. Ensure the most efficient and beneficial provision of public facilities and services for each
tract being subdivided;
I. Provide for compatible relationships between land uses and buildings; provide for the

Construction Details, the Zoning Ordinance, the Building Code, applicable articles of the

Land Use Plan express policies designed to achieve an optimum quality of development in
Wylie and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. If only the minimum standards are followed, as
expressed by the various ordinances regulating land development, a standardization of
development will occur. This will produce a monotonous municipal setting and physical
environment within the community. Subdivision design shall be of a quality that will carry
out the purpose and spirit of the policies expressed within the Comprehensive Plan and
within this Ordinance, and shall be encouraged to exceed the minimum standards required
herein.

or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the application of them to
other persons or circumstances. The City Council hereby declares that it would have
enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any such part, provision, or

Section 1.8: Saving Provision
This Ordinance shall not be construed as abating any action now pending under, or by virtue of,

time of adoption of this Ordinance, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person,
firm or corporation, by lawful action of the City except as shall be expressly provided in this

Section 1.9: Variances/Waivers
A. General. Where the Zoning Board of Adjustment finds that undue hardships will result
from strict compliance with a certain provision(s) of this Ordinance, or where the purposes
of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, the Board
may approve a variance or waiver from any portion of these regulations so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest is secured, provided that the variance or waiver
shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations, and
further provided that the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall not approve a variance or
waiver unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case that:
1. Granting the variance or waiver will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or
welfare, and will not be injurious to other property or to the owners of other property,
and the variance or waiver will not prevent the orderly subdivision of other property in
the vicinity;
2. The conditions upon which the request for a variance or waiver is based are unique to
the property for which the variances or waiver is sought, and are not applicable
generally to other property;
3. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of
the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the property owner would result,
as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is
carried out;
4. The variance or waiver will not in any manner vary the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance or Comprehensive Plan or any other adopted plan(s) of the City;
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
12
5. An alternate design will generally achieve the same result or intent as the standards and
regulations prescribed herein.
Such findings of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, together with the specific facts upon
which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the
Board meeting at which a variance or waiver is considered. A variance or waiver from
any provision of this Ordinance may be granted only when in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this Ordinance so that the public health, safety and welfare may
be secured and substantial justice done. Economic hardship to the property owner or
developer, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship.
B. Criteria for Variance or Waiver From Development Exactions. Where the Zoning Board of
Adjustment finds that the imposition of any development exaction pursuant to these
regulations exceeds reasonable benefit to the property owner, or is so excessive as to
constitute confiscation of the tract to be platted, it may approve a full or partial, at its
discretion, variance or waiver to such requirements, so as to prevent such excess.
C. Conditions. In approving a variance or waiver, the Zoning Board or Adjustment may
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the purposes described
in Section 1.2.
D. Procedures. An application for a variance or waiver shall be submitted in writing by the
property owner to the Board of Adjustment before the plat is submitted for the
consideration of the Commission. The application shall state fully the grounds for the
application, and all of the facts relied upon by the applicant. Where a hardship is identified
during concept plan review pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance or during subdivision review
pursuant to this Ordinance which requires issuance of a variance or waiver from a
provision in this Ordinance, the Commission or Council may not recommend approval of
the concept plan. The applicant will be directed to submit an application for a variance or
waiver to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. No plat shall be approved which does not fully
conform to the provisions of this Ordinance. All variance or waiver shall have final
approval or disapproval by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
E. Criteria for Variance or Waiver for Street Exactions. Where the Zoning Board of
Adjustment finds that the imposition of any dedication or construction requirement for
streets pursuant to these regulations exceeds reasonable benefit to the property to be
platted, it may approve variance or waiver for such requirements so as to prevent such
excess. In order to qualify for a variance or waiver under this Section, the property owner
shall demonstrate that the costs of right-of-way dedication and construction of non-local
streets imposed pursuant to these regulations substantially exceeds the incremental costs of
providing land and transportation improvements necessary to offset the additional traffic
impacts generated by, or attributable to, the development upon the transportation network
serving the property, including that which may be generated by or attributed to other phases
to be platted in the future.

II. PROCEDURES
Section 2.1: Pre-Application Procedures
2.1 The applicant should avail himself or herself of the advice and assistance of the Citys
administrative officers, and should consult early and informally with those officers before
preparing a concept plan or any plat in order to save time and money, and to avoid potential
unnecessary delays.
Prior to formal application for approval of any concept plan or plat, the applicant shall
request and attend a mandatory pre-application conference with the appropriate City
official(s) in order to become familiar with the Citys development regulations and the
subdivision process. At the pre-application conference, the applicant may be represented
by his or her land planner, engineer, or surveyor.
Section 2.2: Statutory Procedures
A. Zoning Requirements. A property within the Citys corporate limits that is being proposed
for platting must be properly zoned by the City, following the procedures of the City of
Wylies Zoning Ordinance, prior to submission of an application for approval of any plat or
plan. In addition, the proposed development layout or subdivision design shown on the
proposed plat or plan must be in conformance with all standards and requirements
prescribed in the Citys Zoning Ordinance.
Noncompliance with the requirements of the zoning district in which the subject property is
located, or lack of the proper zoning, shall constitute grounds for denial of the plat or plan.
In situations where the zoning on a particular piece of property cannot be ascertained by the
City, the burden of proof regarding the propertys zoning shall rest with the property
owner. Proof of proper zoning shall consist of appropriate documentation, such as a copy
of the ordinance establishing the zoning, which shall be reviewed by City officials as to its
validity and authenticity.
Any plat or plan submitted for approval by the City shall be in accordance with the Citys
Zoning Ordinance, if the property is located within the Citys corporate limits, and, if the
property is located within the Citys corporate limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction, it shall
be in accordance with the Citys Comprehensive Plan, including all adopted water, sewer,
storm drainage, future land use, park, recreation, open space and thoroughfare plans. All
plats and plans shall be prepared by a licensed civil engineer or a registered land surveyor.
B. Classification of Subdivisions and Additions. Before any land is filed for record with the
County Clerk, the property owner shall apply for and secure City Council approval of the
required subdivision plat, in accordance with the following procedures, unless otherwise
provided within this Ordinance.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
22
1. Minor subdivisions may be approved for residential or nonresidential properties. Minor
plat approval by the City Planner requires the submission of a final plat drawing and
other submission materials required by Section 2.11 of this Ordinance. Lots may be
conveyed or sold only when the plat has been approved by the City and the plat has
been recorded with the appropriate County of Record.
2. Major subdivisions may be approved for residential or nonresidential properties. The
procedure for approval of a major subdivision typically involves three steps: a concept
plan, preliminary plat and final plat. Sections 2.3 through 2.6 of this Ordinance provide
the requirements for each. Major plat approval shall be in accordance with Sections 2.4
through 2.6 of this Ordinance. All major subdivision plats must be reviewed by the
Commission and approved by the City Council, pursuant to Sections 2.4 through 2.8 of
this Ordinance. Upon completion of the required public improvements, or upon
submission and City approval of the appropriate surety for public improvements, the
property owner may file the final plat in the land record of the appropriate County of
Record. Lots may be sold only when the final plat has been recorded at the appropriate
County of Record. No conveyance or sale of any portion or lot of the property may
occur until after the final plat is approved by the City Council and filed at the
appropriate County of Record.
C. Submission Requirements For All Types of Plat Applications.
1. In addition to the requirements outlined herein for each type of development
application, the City Planner has authority to, and shall establish and maintain separate
policies and procedures for the submission and processing of applications including,
but not limited to, application forms, checklists, language blocks for plats, and other
similar items. The forms, policies, procedures, and other documents references in this
subsection shall be available at the office of the City Planner and published on the City
website. The documents referenced in this subsection may be amended from time to
time by the City Planner, and it is the applicants responsibility to be familiar with, and
to comply with, the then current policies and procedures.
2. On or before September 1 of each year, the City Planner shall establish and maintain an
official submittal calendar for all land development, plat and plan applications and
filings for the period October 1 to September 30 of each year. The official submittal
calendar shall be available at the office of the City Planner and published on the City
website. The City Planner is entitled to make amendments to the official submittal
calendar by publishing the amended calendar on the City website.
3. On or before September 1 of each year, the City Planner shall establish and maintain
an official disapproval response submittal calendar for the period October 1 to
September 30 of each year. The official disapproval response submittal calendar shall

For All Types of Plats, Plans, and Disapproval Responses.
1. For the purpose of these regulations, the official filing date of a plat or plan shall be
the date on which a complete application for approval of any type of plat or plan, that
contains all required elements and information mandated by the Texas Local
Government Code, Chapter 212 and by this Ordinance, is submitted to the City Planner,
after which the statutory period required for approval or disapproval of the plat or plan
shall commence to run. No application shall be accepted for filing or deemed filed
until the City Planner determines that the application is complete and the City issues a
fee receipt.
2. Plat or plan applications which do not include all required information and materials, as
outlined herein and in other City development review policies and procedures, which
may change from time to time, shall be considered incomplete, shall not be accepted by
the City for filing or action, and shall not be scheduled for action on a Commission or
Council agenda until complete application is filed. f an application or filing is not
accepted by the City for filing or action because it is incomplete, then it is not
considered filed under this Subdivision Ordinance and any other law or regulation
governing the application or filing, including Chapter 212 of the Texas Local
Government Code, if applicable.
3. A written notice of incompleteness need not identify all reasons why the application or
filing was deemed incomplete. If a notice contains one or more reasons why the
application or filing was deemed incomplete, addressing the reason(s) identified in the
notice does not guarantee acceptance of a subsequent application or filing.
4. For all incomplete applications and filings, any filing fee paid may be retained by the
City for reviewing the application or filing for completeness. Thereafter, the applicant
must file a new application, including a new filing fee, if the applicant desires the
application to be considered.
5. A determination of completeness shall not constitute a determination of compliance
with the substantive requirements of this Subdivision Ordinance or any other law or
regulation governing the application or filing.
E. Filing Procedures and City Review Process
For All Types of Plats, Plans, and Disapproval Responses.
1. Submission Timing. A complete application for approval of any plat or plan or a
disapproval response shall be filed the City only on an official submittal date
established by the City Planner pursuant to Section 2.2(C) of this Ordinance for each
such submission. A complete application or disapproval response attempted to be filed

engineering plans and landscape and screening plans, shall be sized at 24" by 36", and
shall be drawn to a known engineering scale of not smaller than one hundred feet to the
inch (1"=100') or a larger scale. In cases of large developments which would exceed
the dimensions of the sheet at one hundred foot (100') scale, plats may be on multiple
sheets or to another known engineering scale, as approved by the City and acceptable
for filing at the appropriate County of Record.
3. City Staff Review.
(a) Upon official filing of a complete application for plat or plan approval, City staff

decision (from the original official filing date) prescribed by this Subdivision
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
25
Ordinance. In all other instances (e.g., when the applicant chooses to submit a
revised or amended application on the applicants own accord because of a change
in development decisions), submittal of a modified application shall not be
permitted. The applicant may choose to withdraw the application and submit a new
application or have the municipal authority act on the original application.
4. Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall review all subdivision plat applications, and if in
conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance and with all other applicable
regulations of the City and other applicable laws, they shall be approved by the City
Council.
The Commission shall review each plat application and shall recommend approval,
approval with conditions, or disapproval of the plat.
The City Council shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove a plat
application, after considering the Commission's recommendation on the application.
Council action on the plat shall require a simple majority vote of the Council members
present unless otherwise provided under state law.
5. An applicant may submit a written request to extend the thirty (30) day approval
requirement specified in Section 212.009 of the Texas Local Government Code, if
applicable. If the applicant requests an extension, such request must be received by the
applicable municipal authority on or before the eleventh (11th) calendar day before the
municipal authoritys meeting at which action on the application would have to be
taken based on the statutory deadline to act. Extension requests that are not received by
that date shall not be considered properly submitted, and action shall be taken on the
application at such meeting as scheduled. Requests for extension not submitted in
writing shall be ineffective. Submission of a request for an extension, and acceptance
of the request by the municipal authority, shall not be deemed in any way a waiver of
any requirement set forth in this Ordinance.
F. Simultaneous Submission of Plats. In the event that an applicant submits preliminary plat
and final plat applications simultaneously, as provided in Section 2.4 (C), the City Planner
shall schedule both plat applications for action by the Commission. If the preliminary plat
has not received approval prior to consideration of the final plat by the Commission, then
the Commission shall deny the final plat if the final plat application is not withdrawn by the
applicant. Failure to obtain approval of the preliminary plat shall be grounds for denial of
the final plat. The City Council shall take action on either one or both plat applications, as
applicable, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2 of this Ordinance.
G. Proof of Land Ownership. The City requires proof of land ownership prior to approval of
any development application involving real property. Along with the application
submission, the applicant shall provide written verification, such as a notarized statement
or a power of attorney or other evidence satisfactory to the City Planner, that he or she is
the owner of record of the subject land parcel or parcels, or is the property owners
authorized agent. The City Planner shall have the authority to determine what document(s)
the City will require to prove ownership, such as one of the following:
1. General warranty deed;
2. Special warranty deed;

Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
26
3. Title policy; or
4. Some other documentation that is acceptable to the City Planner.
If ownership cannot be conclusively established prior to the meeting date on which the
development application will be heard, the City shall have the authority to deny the
application on the basis of protecting the public interest in that the applicant has not
established that he or she has the lawful authority to request such development approval for
the subject property. The applicant may resubmit a new development application,
including the submission fees, for the property at any time following such denial.
H. Lapse of Plat Approval. The approval of any concept plan or preliminary plat as required
by the Ordinance, shall be effective for a period of one hundred and eighty-three (183)
calendar days after the date that the plat was approved by the Commission or Council,
except as otherwise provided herein. By 12:01 a.m. on the 184th day following Council
approval of the plat, the applicant must have submitted an application for the next
consecutive step in the platting process. If this is not accomplished, then the approved plan
or plat shall be deemed to have expired and shall become null and void.
The approval of a final plat and the City Engineers approval of engineering plans for
proposed public improvements shall be effective for a period of one hundred and eightythree
(183) days after the date that the plat or plans were approved by the Commission and
Council, respectively. If the required fees are not paid and the applicable site construction
not commenced within this time period, the final plat shall expire and become null and
void, unless such time period is extended or reinstated by the City Planner.
Following the acceptance of all improvements, the final plat shall be filed at the appropriate
County of Record at the applicants earliest convenience. A filed final plat is valid in
perpetuity, unless vacated or amended. Failure to file a final plat with the County in a
timely manner may result in the withholding of connection of City utilities.
I. Extension and Reinstatement Procedure. Prior to the lapse of approval for a plat or plan,
the property owner may petition the City to extend the plat or plan approval. Such petition
shall be considered by the City Council, and an extension may be granted by Council for a
specific period of time. If no petition for extension of plat or plan approval is submitted by
the property owner prior to the expiration date, then the plat or plan shall be deemed to
have expired and shall become null and void. The property owner must thereafter submit a
new plat or plan application for approval, and shall conform to the subdivision regulations
then in effect.
The City Council may extend the approval subject to additional conditions based upon
newly enacted City regulations or State legislation, or such as are necessary to ensure
compliance with the original conditions of approval and to protect the public health, safety
and welfare. The Council may also specify a shorter time for extension of the plat or plan
than the original 183-day approval period.

covered by the preliminary plat.
The preliminary engineering plans shall also contain any plans deemed necessary to show
or document compliance with the Citys ordinances pertaining to nonpoint source pollution
control, on-site sewage facility rules, and any other applicable codes and ordinances of the
City that are related to development of a land parcel. For the purposes of this Ordinance,
complete sets of engineering plans shall include the following plans or sheets (generally in
this order), as well as any additional plans or sheets deemed necessary and requested by the
City Engineer:
-- Cover or title sheet
-- Preliminary plat
-- Existing conditions plan, which shows existing topography, vegetation, tree inventory,

City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
31
-- Traffic control plans (if necessary)
-- Screening and retaining wall plans
-- Landscaping and irrigation plans
The applicant shall have these plans prepared by the applicants own professional
engineer(s), subject to approval of the plans by the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall
review, or cause to be reviewed, the plans and specifications and if approved, shall mark
them Approved and shall return one set to the applicant. If not approved, one set shall be
marked with the objections noted and returned to the applicant for correction, whereupon
the applicants engineer shall correct the plans as requested and shall resubmit them back to
the City Engineer for re-review.
Engineering plans shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional
engineer licensed in the State of Texas, as required by State law governing such professions
and in accordance with this Ordinance and the Citys Design Manuals and Standard
Construction Details. All engineering plans submitted for City review shall be dated and
shall bear the responsible engineer's registration number, his or her designation of
"professional engineer" or "P.E.", and the engineers seal. The City Engineer shall approve
engineering plans when such plans meet all of the requirements of this Ordinance and the
Design Manuals and Standard Construction Details.
Engineering plans shall be in conformance with the Design Manuals and Standard
Construction Details and with the requirements set forth herein. Engineering plans
showing paving and design details of streets, alleys, culverts, bridges, storm sewers, water
mains, sanitary sewers, sidewalks, screening and retaining walls, landscape and irrigation
plans (if appropriate), and other engineering details of the proposed subdivision at a scale
of one inch equals 40 or 50 feet (1" = 40' or 50') horizontally and one inch equals 4, 5, or
10 feet (1" = 4', 5' or 10') vertically shall be submitted to the City Engineer (or designee)
along with a copy of the preliminary plat of the subdivision. The number of copies as
specified by the City shall be submitted along with the preliminary plat submittal.
As part of the engineering plans, a drainage plan showing how the drainage of each lot
relates to the overall drainage plan for the plat under consideration shall be submitted. The
drainage plan shall be made available to each builder within the proposed subdivision and
all builders shall comply with the drainage plan.
H. Revisions to Approved Preliminary Plat. It is generally recognized that minor revisions to
the preliminary plat may be needed before the final plat can be filed at the County of
Record. Minor revisions such as the slight enlargement or shifting of easements or lot
lines, addition of private or franchise utility easements, correction of bearings or distances,
correction of minor labeling errors, addition of erroneously omitted informational items
and labels, etc. may occur on the final plat without the necessity of submitting a new or
amended preliminary plat application. Major revisions, such as obvious reconfiguration of
lot lines or easements, relocation of driveways or access easements or fire lanes, any
modification to the perimeter or boundary of the property, and relocation or addition or
deletion of any public improvement (including corresponding easement), shall necessitate
the filing of a new preliminary plat application. The procedures applicable to such
applications shall be the same as for a preliminary plat, and such re-approval may
constitute a new project thus necessitating submission of a new application form, payment
of new fees, and other requirements.

5. Visibility, Access and Maintenance Easements (to be used if applicable):
The area or areas shown on the plat as "VAM" (Visibility, Access and Maintenance)
Easement(s) are hereby given and granted to the City, its successors and assigns, as an
easement to provide visibility, right of access for maintenance upon and across said
VAM Easement. The City shall have the right but not the obligation to maintain any
and all landscaping within the VAM Easement. Should the City exercise this
maintenance right, then it shall be permitted to remove and dispose of any and all
landscaping improvements, including without limitation, any trees, shrubs, flowers,
ground cover and fixtures. The City may withdraw maintenance of the VAM Easement
at any time. The ultimate maintenance responsibility for the VAM Easement shall rest
with the owners. No building, fence, shrub, tree or other improvements or growths,
which in any way may endanger or interfere with the visibility, shall be constructed in,
on, over or across the VAM Easement. The City shall also have the right but not the
obligation to add any landscape improvements to the VAM Easement, to erect any
traffic control devices or signs on the VAM Easement and to remove any obstruction
thereon. The City, its successors, assigns, or agents shall have the right and privilege at
all times to enter upon the VAM Easement or any part thereof for the purposes and with
all rights and privileges set forth herein.
6. Access Easements (to be used if applicable):
The undersigned does covenant and agree that the access easement may be utilized by
any person or the general public for ingress and egress to other real property, and for
the purpose of general public vehicular and pedestrian use and access, and for fire
department and emergency use in, along, upon and across said premises, with the right
and privilege at all times of the City of Wylie, its agents, employees, workmen and
representatives having ingress, egress, and regress in, along, upon and across said
premises.
a. Other Plat Language. The plat shall include any other applicable language, such as
for drainage, floodway or other special types of easements, or such as for a private
street subdivision, as deemed appropriate and necessary by the City for the purpose
of protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Applicable plat languages are
available at the City upon request.
F. Standards for Approval. No final plat shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Commission or approved by the City Council unless the following standards have been
met:
1. The plat substantially conforms with the approved preliminary plat and other studies
and plans, as applicable;
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
37
2. The construction and installation of required public improvements and City utilities has
been completed and the improvements have been accepted by the City as conforming to
the Citys regulations and design standards (or the proper assurances for construction of
the improvements have been submitted and approved by the City, per Section 6); and
3. The plat conforms to applicable zoning, subdivision and other development related
regulations, including the Citys nonpoint source pollution control ordinance (Article
11.100 of the Code of Ordinances, as amended), on-site sewage facility rules (as
applicable; Article 11.200 of the Code of Ordinances, as amended), and any other
applicable codes or ordinances of the City that are related to development of a land
parcel.
G. Once the engineering plans are approved by the City Engineer, the property owner shall
provide additional sets of the approved plans to the City, as specified by the City Engineer,
for use during construction. A full set of the City-approved engineering plans must be
available for inspection on the job site at all times.
H. When all of the improvements are found to be constructed and completed in accordance
with the approved plans and specifications and with the Citys standards, and upon receipt
by the City of Wylie of a maintenance bond or certificate of deposit in accordance with
Section 6 of this Ordinance from each contractor, three (3) sets of "AS BUILT" (or
"Record Drawing") plans and one (1) set of "As-Built" or "Record Drawing" sepias shall be
submitted with a letter stating the contractor's compliance with this Ordinance. After such
letter is received, the City Engineer shall receive and accept for the City of Wylie the title,
use and maintenance of the improvements according to Section 6.7. The final plat shall not
be filed with the County approved prior to receipt of the above letter and other items, nor
prior to acceptance of the improvements by the City.
I. Timing of Public Improvements.
1. The City Engineer may permit all or some of the public improvements to be installed,
offered for dedication, or accepted by the City after approval of the final plat by the
City Council if there exists a compelling reason that is consistent with the public health,
safety or welfare to do so (also see Section 6).
The City Council may permit or require the deferral of the construction of public
improvements if, in its judgment, deferring the construction would not result in any
harm to the public or would offer significant advantage in coordinating the site's
development with adjacent properties and off-site public improvements. The deferred
construction of any required public improvement(s) must be approved by the City
Council at the time of final plat approval, and the necessary assurances for completion
of the improvements, in accordance with Section 6, shall be a stipulation, or condition,
of approval of the preliminary or final plat.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
38
2. If the City Council does not require that all public improvements be installed, offered
for dedication, or accepted by the City prior to approval of the final plat, the applicant
shall provide assurances or security for the completion of the improvements or
escrowed funds, as provided in Section 6.
J. Effect of Approval. Approval of a final plat authorizes the property owner, upon
fulfillment of all requirements and conditions of approval and upon completion of
construction of all required improvements (or submission of the proper assurances for
construction of same, per Section 6), to submit the final copies, or mylars, of the plat for
filing at appropriate County of Record. Lots may be sold only when the final plat has
been approved by the City Council and the plat has been filed at the appropriate County of
Record. No conveyance or sale of any portion or lot of the property may occur until after
the final plat is approved by the City Council and filed at the appropriate County of Record.
K. Subsequent to acceptance of public improvements by the City Engineer, the applicant shall
return copies of the final plat, with any other required documents and necessary fees
attached thereto, to the City Planner. All necessary filing materials, including mylars, and
blueline copies all bearing original signatures and seals. In addition to mylar copies and a
computer disk containing the digital plat file(s) required by the City Planner, shall be
submitted to the City with the required fees. The City Planner shall secure the signatures
of City of Wylie authorities, and return the signed original plats to the applicant within (30)
days of receipt. The applicant shall file the final plat at the office of the County Clerk of the
appropriate County of Record within thirty (30) calendar days following signing by the
City. The applicant shall return to the City Planner one (1) mylar and six (6) blue-line
copies of the filed plat.

dedicated.
C. Exceptions. No development plat shall be required, where the land to be developed has
received final plat or replat approval prior to the effective date of this Ordinance. The City
Council may, from time to time, exempt other development or land divisions from the
requirements of this Section.
D. Prohibition on Development. No development shall commence, nor shall any building
permit, utility connection permit, electrical connection permit or similar permit be issued,
for any development or land division subject to this Section, until a development plat has
been reviewed by the Commission, approved by the City Council, and submitted to the
City for filing at the County. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the City shall
not require building permits or otherwise enforce the Citys Building Code in the Citys
extraterritorial jurisdiction in relation to any development plat required by this Subdivision
Ordinance.

in the same manner as a final plat (see Sections 2.5), and shall be approved, conditionally
approved, or denied by the City Council following review and recommendation by the
Planning and Zoning Commission in a similar manner as a final plat. Upon approval, the
development plat shall be filed at the County by the City in the same manner as prescribed
for a final plat, and approval of a development plat shall expire if all filing materials are not
submitted to the City Planner and if the plat is not filed at the County within the time
periods specified for a final plat.
H. Submittal Requirements - In addition to all information that is required to be shown on a
final plat (see Section 2.5), a development plat shall:
1. Be prepared by a registered professional land surveyor;
2. Clearly show the boundary of the development plat;
3. Show each existing or proposed building, structure or improvement or proposed
modification of the external configuration of the building, structure or improvement
involving a change therein;

form, the required submission fee, and a certificate showing that all taxes have been
paid on the subject property and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in
accordance with Section 1.10.
Section 2.8: Replatting
A. Replat Required. Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein, a property owner who
proposes to replat any portion of an already approved final plat, other than to amend or
vacate the plat, must first obtain approval for the replat under the same standards and by the
same procedures prescribed for the final platting of land by this Ordinance. All
improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the same requirements as for a
preliminary or final plat, as provided herein. The City Planner may waive or modify
requirements for a preliminary replat under certain circumstances where the proposed
replat does not involve a large land parcel or an existing structure or business on the subject
property, and where the proposed plat revisions are relatively simple in nature.
B. Replatting Without Vacating Preceding Plat. A replat of a final plat or portion of a final
plat may be recorded and is controlling over the preceding plat without vacation of that plat
if the replat:
1. Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being replatted;
2. Is approved, after parties in interest and citizens have an opportunity to be heard, by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and by the City Council; and
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
41
3. Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions previously
incorporated in the final plat.
C. Previous Requirements or Conditions of Approval Which Are Still Valid. In addition to
compliance with (b) above, a replat without vacation of the preceding plat must conform to
the requirements of this Section if:
1. During the preceding five (5) years, any of the area to be replatted was limited by an
interim or permanent zoning classification to residential use for not more than two (2)
residential units per lot; or
2. Any lot in the preceding plat was limited by deed restrictions to residential use for not
more than two (2) residential units per lot.
D. If the neighboring property owners file with the City a written protest of the replatting, or if
the replat requires a variance or waiver as defined in Section 1.9, then approval of the
replat will require the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the City Council
members present and voting. For a legal protest, written instruments signed by the owners
of at least twenty percent (20%) of the area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the
area covered by the proposed replat and extending two hundred feet (200') from that area,
but within the original subdivision, must be filed with the City prior to action by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. In computing the percentage of land area subject to the
20% rule described above, the area of streets and alleys shall be included.
E. Any replat which adds or deletes lots must include the original subdivision and lot
boundaries. If a replat is submitted for only a portion of a previously platted subdivision,
the replat must reference the previous subdivision name and recording information, and
must state on the replat the specific lots which have changed.
F. If the previous plat is vacated as prescribed in Section 212.013 of the Texas Local
Government Code, as amended, a public hearing is not required for a replat of the area
vacated.
G. The replat of the subdivision shall meet all the requirements for a final plat for a new
subdivision that may be pertinent, as provided for herein.
H. The title shall identify the document as a Final Plat of the _________ Addition, Block
____, Lot(s) ____, Being a Replat of Block ______, Lot(s) _____ of the
________________ Addition, an addition to the City of Wylie, Texas, as recorded in
Volume/Cabinet _____, Page/Slide ______ of the Records of (the appropriate) County of
Record, Texas.
I. An application submittal for a replat shall be the same as for a final plat, and shall be
accompanied by the required number of copies of the plat, a completed application form,
the required submission fee, and a certificate showing that all taxes have been paid on the
subject property and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in accordance with
Section 1.10.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
42
J. The replat shall be filed at the County in the same manner as prescribed for a final plat, and
approval of a replat shall expire if all filing materials are not submitted to the City, and if
the replat is not filed at the County within the time periods specified for a final plat.
Section 2.9: Amending Plats
A. An amended plat shall meet all of the informational and procedural requirements set forth
for a final plat, and shall be accompanied by the required number of copies of the plat, a
completed application form, the required submission fee, and a certificate showing that all
taxes have been paid on the subject property and that no delinquent taxes exist against the
property in accordance with Section 1.10.
B. The City Planner may approve an amending plat, which may be recorded and is controlling
over the preceding or final plat without vacation of that plat, if the amending plat is signed
by the applicants only and if the amending plat is for one or more of the purposes set forth
in this Section. The procedures for amending plats shall apply only if the sole purpose of
the amending plat is to:
1. Correct an error in a course or distance shown on the preceding plat;
2. Add a course or distance that was omitted on the preceding plat;
3. Correct an error in a real property description shown on the preceding plat;

B. By All Lot Owners. If some or all of the lots covered by the plat have been sold, the plat,
or any part of the plat, may be vacated on the application of all the owners of lots in the plat
with approval obtained in the manner prescribed for the original plat.
C. Criteria. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review, and the City Council shall
approve, the petition for vacation on such terms and conditions as are in accordance with
Section 212.013 of the Texas Local Government Code (as amended), and as are reasonable
to protect the public health, safety and welfare. As a condition of vacation of the plat, the
City Council may direct the petitioners to prepare and seek approval of a revised final plat
in accordance with this Ordinance such that the property does not become unplatted.
D. Effect of Action. On the execution and recording of the vacating instrument, the vacated
plat shall have no effect. Regardless of the Commission's and Council's action on the
petition, the property owner will have no right to a refund of any monies, fees or charges
paid to the City nor to the return of any property or consideration dedicated or delivered to
the City except as may have previously been agreed to by the Commission and City
Council.
E. City-Initiated Plat Vacation.
1. General Conditions. The City Council, on its motion, may vacate the plat of an
approved subdivision or addition when:
(a) No lots within the approved plat have been sold within five (5) years following the
date that the plat was signed by the City;
(b) The property owner has breached an improvement agreement and the City is unable
to obtain funds with which to complete construction of public improvements,
except that the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by property owner or its
successor; or
(c) The plat has been of record for more than five (5) years and the City determines that
the further sale of lots within the subdivision or addition presents a threat to public
health, safety or welfare, except that the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by
the property owner or its successors.
2. Procedure. Upon any motion of the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council
to vacate the plat of any previously approved subdivision or addition, in whole or in
part, the City shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the County.
The City shall also provide personal notice to all property owners within the
subdivision or addition and to the City Council. The notice shall state the time and
place for a public hearing on the motion to vacate the subdivision or addition plat. The
Commission shall recommend approval and the City Council shall approve the vacation
only if the criteria and conditions cited above are satisfied.

County Clerk of the appropriate County of Record with a copy of the area or plat
vacated. The County Clerk shall write legibly on the vacated plat the word vacated
and shall enter on the plat a reference to the volume and page at which the vacating
instrument is recorded. If the Commission and City Council adopt a resolution or
ordinance vacating a plat in part, it shall cause a revised final plat to be recorded which
shows that portion of the original plat that has been vacated and that portion that has
not been vacated. On the execution and recording of the vacating instrument the
vacated plat has no effect.
Section 2.11: Minor Plats
A. A minor plat shall meet all of the informational and procedural requirements set forth for a
final plat, and shall be accompanied by the required number of copies of the plat, a
completed application form, the required submission fee, and a certificate showing that all
taxes have been paid on the subject property and that no delinquent taxes exist against the
property in accordance with Section 1.10.
B. The City Planner may approve a minor plat, or may, for any reason, elect to present the
minor plat to the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council for consideration and
approval. Any decision made on the minor plat by the City Planner shall be approval of the
plat. Should the City Planner refuse to approve the minor plat, then the plat shall be
referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council for consideration
within the time period required by State law.
C. Notice, a public hearing, and the approval of other lot owners are not required for the
approval a minor plat.
D. The minor plat shall be entitled and clearly state that it is a "minor plat."
E. The minor plat shall be filed at the County in the same manner as prescribed for a final plat,
and approval of a minor plat shall expire if all filing materials are not submitted to the City

III. SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 3.1: Streets
A. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to
the City of Wylies Thoroughfare Plan and Four Cities Thoroughfare Plan as well as
Design Manuals and Standard Construction Details, and shall be considered in their
relation to existing and planned streets or driveways (whether within the City of Wylie,
within its ETJ area, or within adjacent municipal or County areas), to topographical
conditions, to public safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the
land to be served by such streets. Reserve or residual strips of land controlling access to or
egress from other property, or to or from any street or alley, or having the effect of
restricting or damaging the adjoining property for subdivision purposes, or which will not
be taxable or accessible for improvements shall not be permitted in any subdivision unless
such are required by the City in the public interest (such as to enhance public safety or
other public interest). All streets shall be constructed in accordance with the Citys Design
Manuals and Standard Construction Details.
B. Adequacy of Streets and Thoroughfares.
1. Responsibility for Adequacy of Streets and Thoroughfares. The property owner shall
assure that the subdivision is served by adequate streets and thoroughfares, and shall be
responsible for the costs of all rights-of-way and street improvements adjacent to the
development, in accordance with the following policies and standards, and subject to
the City's cost participation policies on oversized facilities.
2. General Adequacy Policy. Every subdivision shall be served by improved streets and
thoroughfares adequate to accommodate the vehicular traffic to be generated by the
development. Proposed streets shall provide a safe, convenient and functional system
for traffic circulation; shall be properly related to the City's Thoroughfare Plan, road
classification system, Comprehensive Plan and any amendments thereto; and shall be
appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of each development.
3. Road Network. New subdivisions shall be supported by a road network having
adequate capacity, ingress/egress, and safe and efficient traffic circulation. The
adequacy of the road network for developments of one hundred (100) or more dwelling
units, or for developments generating one thousand (1,000) or more "one-way" trips per
day, or for developments involving collector or arterial streets not appearing on the
City's adopted Thoroughfare Plan, or where deemed required by the City Engineer,
shall be demonstrated by preparation and submission, along with the concept plan or
preliminary plat application, of a traffic impact analysis prepared in accordance with
Subsection (f), Traffic Impact Analysis, which takes
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
49
into consideration the need to accommodate traffic generated by the development, land
to be developed in common ownership and other developed property. In the event that
the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a larger development project, or
constitutes a portion of the land to be ultimately developed, the City Council may
require a demonstration of adequacy pursuant to this Section for additional phases or
portions of the property as a condition of approval for the proposed concept plan or
plat. In the event that the applicant submits a traffic impact analysis for an entire
phased development project, the City may require an update of the study for later
phases of the development. If the concept plan or plat is in conformance with the
Thoroughfare Plan and if the concept plan or plat is for a development of less than one
hundred (100) dwelling units or for a development generating less than one thousand
(1,000) "one-way" trips per day, then a traffic impact analysis may be required at the
discretion of the City Engineer.
4. Approach Roads and Access. All subdivisions must have at least two (2) points of
vehicular access (primarily for emergency vehicles), which must be connected via
improved roadways to the City's improved thoroughfare and street system by one or
more approach roads of such dimensions and improved to such standards as are
hereinafter set forth. Requirements for dedication of right-of-way and improvement of
approach roads may be increased depending upon the size or density of the proposed
development, or if such need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis.
Two (2) points of vehicular access shall be construed to mean that the subdivision
has at least two (2) improved roads accessing the subdivision from the Citys improved
thoroughfare system, and the subdivision has at least two road entrances. The City
Council may, at its discretion and upon a finding that such will not compromise public
safety or impede emergency access, accept a single median-divided entrance from the
Citys improved thoroughfare system provided that the median extends into the
subdivision to an intersecting internal street which provides at least two (2) routes to
the interior of the subdivision. For example, the entrance street is not a dead-end or
cul-de-sac, and it does not create a bottleneck allowing only one emergency route
into the interior of the subdivision.
The subdivision shall be designed to provide adequate emergency access for public
safety vehicles. Each residential lot in the subdivision shall have a minimum frontage
on a dedicated street as required by applicable zoning or thirty (30) feet, whichever is
greater, unless other provisions have been authorized through planned development
approval.
5. Off-Site Improvements. Where traffic impact analysis demonstrates the need for such
facilities, the property owner shall make such improvements to off-site collector and
arterial streets and intersections as are necessary to mitigate traffic impacts generated
by the development or related developments.

6. Street Dedications.
(a) Dedication of Right-of-Way. The property owner shall provide all rights-of-way
required for existing or future streets, and for all required street improvements,
including perimeter streets and approach roads, as shown in the Thoroughfare Plan,
Design Manuals and Standard Construction Details or other valid development
plans approved by City Council. In the case of perimeter streets, half of the total
required right-of-way width for such streets shall be provided unless the proposed
development is on both sides of the street, in which case the full right-of-way width
shall be provided. In some instances, more than half of the required width shall be
required when a half street is impractical or unsafe and depending upon the actual
or proposed alignment of the street, such as in the case of a curved street, as may be
required by the City Council.
(b) Perimeter Streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision or
addition, the other half of the street shall be dedicated, and an appropriate amount
of the street shall be improved, by the developer of the subdivision or addition.
(c) Slope Easements. The dedication of easements, in addition to dedicated rights-ofway
shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is necessary to
provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall be no steeper than three (3) feet
horizontal run to one (1) foot vertical height, or a three-to-one (3:1) slope.
7. Street Construction. All streets and thoroughfares shall be constructed and paved to
City standards and within rights-of-way as required by the Thoroughfare Plan and this
Ordinance, and in accordance with the Design Manuals and Standard Construction
Details and other regulations as may be from time to time amended or adopted by the
City Council.
8. Intersection Improvements and Traffic Control Devices shall be installed as warranted
in accordance with the traffic impact analysis. Construction and design standards shall
be in accordance with City Design Manuals and Standard Construction Details.
9. Phased Development. Where a subdivision is proposed to occur in phases, the
applicant, in conjunction with submission of the preliminary plat, shall provide a
schedule of development. The schedule shall set forth the intended plan of
development and dedication of rights-of-way for streets and street improvements,
whether on-site or off-site, intended to serve each proposed phase of the subdivision.
The City Engineer shall determine whether the proposed streets and street
improvements are adequate pursuant to standards herein established, and may require
that a traffic impact analysis be submitted for the entire project or such phases as the
City determines to be necessary to adjudge whether the subdivision will be adequately
served by streets and thoroughfares.

10. Private Streets. Subdivisions having private streets may be established only under the
terms set forth in this Section, and pursuant to any other ordinances or guidelines for
private street developments as may be adopted for use by the City either as part of this
Ordinance or as separate ordinances or policies. All private streets shall be designed
and constructed in accordance with the Citys Design Manual and Standard
Construction Details for publicly dedicated streets. The term Private Street shall be
inclusive of alleys, if such are to be provided within the subdivision.
(a) Private Streets: Subdivision Eligibility Criteria. Private streets shall be permitted
only within a subdivision satisfying each of the following criteria:
(1) The subdivision shall have a sufficient number of lots and value to demonstrate
through an approved economic analysis the viability of private maintenance by
the development served; and
(2) The streets to be restricted to private use are not intended for regional or local
through traffic circulation (see Subsection 3.1c.10.(b) below); and
(3) The subdivision is located in an area that is surrounded on three (3) sides,
meaning at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the perimeter, by natural or manmade
barriers, so as to be accessible from only a single direction of the
compass; and
(4) The subdivision is located adjacent to an existing or approved public street that
can be reasonably connected, even though the street connection may require
construction of a bridge or culvert; and
(5) A mandatory property owners (homeowners) association, which includes all
property to be served by the private streets, shall be formed and shall be
responsible for maintenance of the private streets and alleys. (see Subsection
3.1c.10.(e) below and Section 4.3); and
(6) The subdivision conforms to any other special guidelines for private street
developments as may be approved separately by the City Council.
(b) Private Streets: Certain Streets Excluded. Roads or streets that are shown on the
Citys Thoroughfare Plan, such as highways, major or minor thoroughfares or
arterials, or collectors, shall not be used, maintained or constructed as private
streets, and a private street subdivision shall not cross or interfere with an existing
or future collector or arterial street. Also, the Planning and Zoning Commission
and City Council may deny the creation of any private street if, in their sole
judgment, the private street would negatively affect traffic circulation on public
streets, or if it would impair access to the subject or adjacent property; impair
access to or from public facilities including schools or parks; or if it would cause
possible delays in the response time of emergency vehicles.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
52
(c) Private Streets: Parks, Greenbelts and Wildlife Preserves Excluded. A private street
subdivision shall not cross or interfere with public access to an existing or future
public pedestrian pathway, hike and bike trail, greenbelt, park or wildlife preserve
as shown on the City of Wylies Parks and Open Space Master Plan or as already
dedicated for public use.
(d) Private Streets: Property Owners or Homeowners Association Required.
Subdivisions developed with private streets shall have a mandatory property owners
association which includes all property and lots served by the private streets (see
Section 4.3). The association shall own and be responsible for the maintenance of
private streets and appurtenances. The association documents shall be reviewed
and approved by the City Planner and the City Attorney to ensure that they conform
to these and other applicable City rules and regulations. The documents shall be
filed of record at the appropriate County prior to final plat acceptance in order to
ensure that there is an entity in place for long-term maintenance of private streets
and appurtenances. The association may not be dissolved without the prior written
consent of the City Council. No portion of the association documents pertaining to
the maintenance of private streets and alleys, and assessments therefore, may be
amended without the written consent of the City Council. The City will not assist
in enforcing deed restrictions.
(e) Private Streets: Private Street Lot. Private streets must be constructed within a
separate lot owned by the property owners association. This lot must conform to
the Citys standards for public street rights-of-way. An easement covering the
street lot shall be granted to the City providing unrestricted access to and use of the
property for any purpose deemed necessary by the City. This right shall also extend
to all utility providers operating within the City and to other necessary
governmental service providers, such as the U.S. Postal Service. The easement
shall also permit the City to remove any vehicle or obstacle within the street lot that
may impair emergency access.
(f) Private Streets: Construction and Maintenance Cost. The City shall not pay for any
portion of the cost of constructing or maintaining a private street.
(g) Private Streets: Infrastructure and Utilities. Any public water, sewer and drainage
facilities, street lights, and traffic control devices, such as traffic signs, placed
within the private street lot shall be designed and constructed to City standards, and
shall be accepted by and dedicated to the City prior to filing the record plat for the
subdivision. All private traffic control devices and regulatory signs shall conform to
the Texas Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, as amended, and to City
standards.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
53
The metering for utilities such as water, gas and electricity shall be located on the
individual lots to be served, not grouped together in a centralized location(s), such
as gang-box style metering stations, which shall not be permitted.
(h) Private Streets: Plans and Inspections. Development applications for subdivisions
with private streets must include the same plans and engineering information
required for public streets and utilities. City requirements pertaining to inspection
and approval of improvements shall apply, and fees charged for these services shall
also apply. The City may periodically inspect private streets, and may require any
repairs necessary to ensure efficient emergency access and to protect the public
health, safety, convenience and welfare.
(i) Private Streets: Restricted Access. The entrances to all private streets shall be
clearly marked with a sign, placed in a prominent and visible location, stating that
the streets within the subdivision are private, and that they are not maintained nor
regularly patrolled by the City. Guard houses, access control gates, and cross arms,
if used, shall be constructed per Subsection (k) below. All restricted access
entrances must be manned twenty-four (24) hours every day, or they must provide a
reliable, alternative means of ensuring City and emergency access to the
subdivision, preferably with an Opticom-type system for emergency access, by the
City and other utility or public service providers, such as postal carriers and utility
companies, with appropriate identification. The method to be used to ensure City
and emergency access into the subdivision shall be approved by the City Council
and by all applicable emergency services providers prior to engineering release for
construction of the development. If the association fails to maintain reliable access
as required herein, the City may enter the subdivision and remove any gate or
device which is a barrier to access at the sole expense of the association. The
association documents shall contain provisions in conformity with this Section
which may not be amended without the written consent of the City Council.
(j) Private Streets: Access Restricted Entrance Design Standards. Any private street
(and any other type of gated entrance) which has an access control gate or cross arm
must have a minimum uninterrupted pavement width of twenty-seven (27) feet at
the location of the gate or access control device, both ingress point and egress point,
regardless of the type of device used. If an overhead, or lift-up, barrier is used, it
must be a minimum of fourteen (14) feet in height above the road surface, and this
clearance height shall be extended for a minimum distance of fifty (50) feet in front
of and
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19

behind the location of the device. All gates and cross arms must be of a breakaway
design. A minimum vehicle stacking distance of one hundred (100) feet shall be
provided from the right-of-way line of the public road from which the private street
subdivision is accessed to the first vehicle stopping point, which is usually an
access request keypad, a telephone, or a guards window. Adequate distance shall
be provided between the access request point(s) and the entry barrier, or gate, to
accommodate a vehicle turnaround as described below.
A paved turnaround space must be located in front of (i.e., prior to passage of) any
restricted access entrance barrier, between the access request device and the barrier
or gate, to allow vehicles that are denied access to safely exit onto public streets
without having to back up, particularly into the public street upon which the
entrance is located. The design and geometry of such turnaround shall be of such
pavement width and having such inside turning radius that it will accommodate
smooth, single-motion U-turn movements by the types of service and utility trucks
that typically visit or make deliveries to neighborhoods that are similar to the
proposed private street development shall be accommodated, such as utility service
vehicles, postal or UPS delivery trucks, and two- to three-axle flatbed or box-type
trucks used by contractors and moving companies.
The City Engineer may require submission of additional drawings plans or exhibits
demonstrating that the proposed turnaround will work properly, and that vehicle
turnaround movements will not compromise public safety on the entry roadway or
on the adjacent public street(s).
A site plan showing the design and location of all proposed access restricted
entrances shall be submitted for review by the City Engineer along with the
engineering plans for the subdivision, and must be approved by the City Council
along with approval of the preliminary plat.
(k) Private Streets: Waiver of Services. The subdivision final plat, property deeds and
property owners association documents shall note that certain City services shall not
be provided for private street subdivisions. Among the services which will not be
provided are: routine law enforcement patrols, enforcement of traffic and parking
regulations, and preparation of accident reports. Depending upon the characteristics
of the development and upon access limitations posed by the design of entrances
into the subdivision, other services (such as sanitation) may not be provided, as
well.

(l) Private Streets: Petition to Convert to Public Streets. The property owners
association documents shall allow the association to petition the City to accept
private streets and any associated property as public streets and right-of-way upon
written notice to all association members and upon the favorable vote of a majority
of the membership. However, in no event shall the City be obligated to accept said
streets as public. Should the City elect to accept the streets as public, then the City
has the right to inspect the private streets and to assess the lot owners for the
expense of needed repairs concurrent with the Citys acceptance of the streets. The
City shall be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed. The City may also
require, at the associations or the lot owners expense, the removal of any guard
houses, access control devices, landscaping or other aesthetic amenities located
within the street lot or within any other common area. The association documents
shall provide for the Citys right to such removal and assessment. Those portions of
the association documents pertaining to the subject matter contained in this Section
shall not be amended without the written consent of the City Council.
(m) Private Streets: Hold Harmless. On the subdivision final plat shall be language
whereby the property owners association, as owner of the private streets and
appurtenances, agrees to release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, any
other governmental entity, and any public utility entity for damages to the private
streets that may be occasioned by the reasonable use of the private streets by same,
and for damages and injury (including death) arising from the condition of the
private streets, out of any use of access gates or cross arms, or out of any use of the
subdivision by the City or governmental or utility entity (such plat language is
available from the City).
C. (reserved)
D. Escrow Policies and Procedures.
1. Request for Escrow. Whenever this Ordinance requires a property owner to construct a
street or thoroughfare, or other type of public improvement, the property owner may, if
there exists unusual circumstances, such as a timing issue due to pending roadway
improvements by another agency such as TxDOT or the appropriate County of Record,
that would present undue hardships or that would impede public infrastructure
coordination or timing, petition the City to construct the street or thoroughfare, usually
at a later date, in exchange for deposit of escrow as established in this Section. If more
than one street or thoroughfare must be constructed in order to meet adequacy
requirements for roadways, as demonstrated by a traffic impact analysis, the City
Engineer may prioritize roadways for which escrow is to be accepted and require the
deposit of all funds attributable to the development in escrow accounts for one or more
of such
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
56
affected roadways. The City Council shall review the particular circumstances
involved (a traffic impact analysis may be required to facilitate the City Councils
deliberations on the matter), and shall determine, at its sole discretion, whether or not
provision of escrow deposits will be acceptable in lieu of the property owners
obligation to construct the street or thoroughfare with his or her development.
2. Escrow Deposit With the City. Whenever the City shall agree to accept escrow
deposits in lieu of construction by the owner of the property under this Ordinance, the
property owner or developer shall deposit in escrow with the City an amount equal to
his or her share of the costs of design, construction, permits, reviews and approvals,
inspections, any additional land acquisition, and an appropriate and the current standard
inflation factor to ensure that the actual future dollar costs will be covered when
actual construction occurs in the future. Such amount shall be paid prior to release of
engineering plans by the City Engineer. The obligations and responsibilities of the
property owner shall become those of the property owner's transferees, successors and
assigns; and the liability therefore shall be joint and several.
3. Determination of Escrow Amount. The amount of the escrow shall be determined by
using the maximum comparable turnkey bid price of construction of the
improvements (including design, permits, reviews and approvals, inspections and any
additional land acquisition that may be needed). Such determination of the escrow
amount shall be made as of the time the escrow is due hereunder.
4. Termination of Escrow. Escrows which have been placed with the City under this
Section or in accordance with previously approved street improvement policies, and
which have been held for a period of twenty (20) years from the date of such payment
or agreement, in the event that the City has not authorized the preparation of plans and
specifications for construction of such roadway facilities for which the escrow was
made, shall, upon written request, be returned to the current property owner, with any
accrued interest. Such return does not remove any obligations of the property owner
for construction of the required facilities if a building permit has not been issued on the
subject lot or if a new building permit is applied for.
5. Refund. If any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed by a
party other than the City, or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no
cost to the City, the escrowed funds and accrued interest shall be refunded to the
current property owner or applicant who originally paid the escrow amount after
completion and acceptance of the public improvements. In the event that a portion of
the cost is borne by the City and the other portion of the cost by another party or
governmental authority, the difference between the property owner's actual
proportionate cost and the escrowed funds, including accrued interest, if any, shall be
refunded after completion and acceptance of the improvements.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
57
6. Interest Limitation. If money is refunded within six (6) months of deposit, only the
principal will be refunded. Monies returned after this date will be refunded with
interest accrued, calculated at one percent (1%) less than the rate of actual earnings.
Existing funds, collected for previous subdivision development such as Perimeter Street
funds, shall be refunded as stated in Section 4 above, principle and earned interest.
E. Traffic Impact Analysis. Any proposed development project or plat involving a significant
change to a proposed roadway alignment from that shown on the City of Wylies
Thoroughfare Plan (or involving a development of one hundred (100) or more dwelling
units, or for developments generating one thousand (1,000) or more "one-way" trips per
day), or as required by the City Engineer, must be preceded by submission and approval of
a traffic impact analysis as specified in Subsection (f) below. Failure to provide for such
approval prior to submission of a preliminary plat (or concurrently with the preliminary
plat application) shall be grounds for denial of the plat application.
F. Required Components of Traffic Impact Analysis. Whenever this Ordinance (or the City
Council, in unique instances which do not necessarily meet the above criteria but which
may significantly affect the public health, safety or welfare, such as a proposed subdivision
that will only be accessed via substandard roadways which may pose an impediment to
emergency response vehicles) require submission and City Council approval of a traffic
impact analysis, the following elements shall be included:
1. General Site Description. The traffic impact analysis shall include a detailed
description of the roadway network within one (1) mile of the site, a description of the
proposed land uses, the anticipated states of construction, and the anticipated
completion date of the proposed land development shall be provided. This description,
which may be in the form of a map, shall include the following items: (1) all major
intersections; (2) all proposed and existing ingress and egress locations; (3) all
existing roadway widths and rights-of-way; (4) all existing traffic signals and trafficcontrol
devices; and (5) all existing and proposed public transportation services and
facilities within a one (1) mile radius of the site.
2. Proposed Capital Improvements. The traffic impact analysis shall identify any changes
to the roadway network within one (1) mile of the site that are proposed by any
government agency or other developer. This description shall include the above items
as well as any proposed construction project that would alter the width or alignment of
roadways affected by the proposed development.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
58
3. Roadway Impact Analysis.
(a) Transportation Impacts:
(1) Trip Generation. The average weekday trip generation rates (trip ends), the
average weekend trip generation rates (for uses other than residential or
institutional), the highest average a.m. and p.m. hourly weekday trip generation
rates, and the highest hourly weekend generation rates (for uses other than
residential or institutional) for the proposed use shall be determined based upon
the trip generation rates contained in the most recent edition of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation Manual; or shall be based upon data
generated by actual field surveys of area uses compatible to the proposed use
and approved by the City Engineer.
(2) Trip Distribution. The distribution of trips to arterial and collector roadways
within the study area identified in Subsection 3.1f.1 (General Site Description)
above shall be in conformity with accepted traffic engineering principles, taking
into consideration the land use categories of the proposed development; the area
from which the proposed development will attract traffic; competing
developments (if applicable); the size of the proposed development;
development phasing; surrounding existing and anticipated land uses,
population and employment; existing and projected daily traffic volumes; and
existing traffic conditions identified pursuant to Subsection 3.1f.1 above.
(b) Adequacy Determination. The roadway network included within the traffic impact
analysis shall be considered adequate to serve the proposed development if existing
roadways identified as arterials and collectors can accommodate the existing service
volume, and the service volume of the proposed development, and the service
volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid, unexpired building
permits at a level of service "C" or above.
4. Intersection Analysis.
(a) Level of Service Analysis. For intersections within the roadway traffic impact
analysis area described in Subsection 3.1f.1 herein (General Site Description), a
level of service analysis shall be performed for all arterial to arterial, arterial to
collector, and collector to collector intersections, and for any other pertinent
intersections identified the City Engineer. Also, level of service analysis will be
required on all proposed site driveway locations for all nonresidential
developments. The City may waive analysis of minor intersections and site
driveway locations within the one-mile radius. The level of service analysis shall
be based upon the highest hourly average a.m. or p.m. peak weekday volume or
highest average hourly peak weekend
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
59
volume as determined from a two-day survey of weekday volumes and, where
necessary, a one-day survey of weekend volumes. The level of service analysis shall
take into consideration the lane geometry, traffic volume, percentage of right-hand
turns, percentage of left-hand turns, percentage (and typical size) of trucks, intersection
width, number of lanes, signal timing and progression, roadway grades, pedestrian and
bicycle flows, school routes, number of accidents, and peak hour factor.
(b) Adequacy Analysis. The intersections included within the traffic impact analysis
shall be considered adequate to serve the proposed development if existing
intersections can accommodate the existing service volume, the service volume of
the proposed development, and the service volume of approved but unbuilt
developments holding valid, unexpired building permits at level of service C or
above.
5. Effect of Adequacy Determination. If the adequacy determination for roadways and
intersections indicates that the proposed development would cause a reduction in the
level of service for any roadway or intersection within the study area identified in
Subsection 3.1f.1 herein that would cause the roadway to fall below the level of service
required hereto, the proposed development shall be denied unless the developer agrees
to one of the following conditions:
(a) The deferral of building permits until the improvements necessary to upgrade the
substandard facilities are constructed;
(b) A reduction in the density or intensity of development;
(c) The dedication or construction of facilities needed to achieve the level of service
required herein; or
(d) Any combination of techniques identified herein that would ensure that
development will not occur unless the levels of service for all roadways and
intersections within the traffic impact analysis study are adequate to accommodate
the impacts of such development.
G. Arrangement of Streets Not Shown on the Thoroughfare Plan. For streets that are not
shown on the Citys Thoroughfare Plan, such as local residential streets, the arrangement of
such streets within a subdivision shall:
1. Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets from or into
surrounding areas, including at least two (2) points of access;
2. Conform to a special area plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the City
Council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make
continuance or conformity to existing streets impractical;
3. Provide for additional future access, such as by stubbing streets for future extension, to
adjacent vacant areas which will likely develop under a similar zoning classification or
for a similar type of land use; and
4. Not conflict in any way with existing or logically anticipated driveway openings.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
60
H. Residential collector streets and minor residential streets shall be laid out such that their use
by through traffic will be discouraged, such as via circuitous routes or multiple turns or
offsets, but such that access is provided to adjacent subdivisions. Wherever the right-ofway
width of a collector or residential street must transition to a greater or lesser width,
such transition shall occur along the front, side or rear lot lines of adjacent lots and shall
not occur within the street intersection itself. In other words, the right-of-way width shall
be the same on both sides of the street intersection.
I. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the City
Council may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage (lots which back onto the
arterial), deep lots with rear service alleys, or such treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local
traffic.
J. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is
required by the City and approved by the City Council.
K. Street right-of-way widths shall be as shown on the Thoroughfare Plan and as defined by
the corresponding roadway cross-sections in the Thoroughfare Plan and the Citys Design
Manual and Standard Construction Details.
L. Construction of half streets shall be prohibited, except when essential to the reasonable
development of the subdivision in conforming with the other requirements of this
Ordinance and the Thoroughfare Plan, and where the City Council makes a determination
that there is no immediate benefit to be gained by constructing the full street section since
no access from the street will be needed by the subdivision in question. The City Council
may also find that it would be more practical, or cost effective, to delay construction of the
other half of a street until when the adjoining property is developed.
If the property owner is responsible for one-half (1/2) of the street, then the property owner
shall either construct the facility along with his or her development or shall provide escrow
for the construction cost of his or her share of the facility (including all applicable street
appurtenances such as median openings, left turn lanes into the development, sidewalks,
drainage structures, etc.) unless the City participates in the construction of the facility.
Whenever a partial street has been previously platted along a common property line, the
other portion of the street right-of-way shall be dedicated such that the right-of-way is
increased to the streets ultimate planned width. Improvements shall be made to all on-site
facilities as defined herein (see Definitions, Section 1.13).
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
61
M. Except in unusual cases, no dead-end streets will be approved unless such dead-end streets
are provided to connect with future streets on adjacent land. In the case of dead-end
streets, which will eventually be extended into the adjacent subdivision, no more than one
lot (per side) can front onto the dead-end street stub unless a temporary turnaround bulb
(with an off-site easement) is provided at the end. A temporary dead-end street shall not
exceed the maximum allowed length of a normal cul-de-sac, and the temporary turnaround
bulb must be constructed like a cul-de-sac, as provided in Subsection (p) above (the City
Engineer may authorize the use of asphalt or other durable paving material than concrete
for the arc, or wing, portions of the temporary turnaround bulb in order to minimize the
cost of removing those portions later on). A note shall be placed on the final plat clearly
labeling any dead-end streets (if any) that will at some point be extended into the adjacent
property, and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street stub, such as on
the barricade, also stating that the street will be extended in the future. Signage and
lettering must be large enough to be legible by a person with normal vision at a twenty-foot
distance. Any required temporary turnaround easements shall be shown on the final plat
along with their appropriate recording information, if they are off-site or established by
separate instrument.
N. New streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets, and
shall be dedicated at equal or greater right-of-way widths than the existing streets.
O. Construction of New Streets. All new streets dedicated within a subdivision shall be
constructed in accordance with paving widths and specifications as set forth in the Design
Manuals and Standard Construction Details of the City of Wylie at the time at which the
preliminary plat application is officially submitted and deemed a complete application.
Q. Points of Access. All subdivisions shall have at least two (2) points of access from
improved public roadways (also see Section 3.1c.4). Driveway access onto roadways shall
be provided and designed in accordance with the Citys Design Manuals and Construction
Details standards that are in effect at the time the preliminary plat application is officially
submitted and deemed a complete application.
R. Streets will be constructed in accordance to the Citys Design Manuals and Standard
Construction Details standards that are in effect at the time the preliminary plat application
is officially submitted and deemed a complete application.
Section 3.2: Alleys
A. No alleys shall be required within nonresidential districts. If provided or constructed by the
developer, nonresidential alleys shall conform to the adopted Design Manual and Stand
Construction Details.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
62
B. Alleys shall be required in all residential districts within the City of Wylie and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction, and shall be constructed in accord with the adopted Design
Manual. The City Council may waive this alley requirement or part thereof when
determined to be in the best interest of the City.
Section 3.3: Easements
A. The minimum width for City easements shall be fifteen (15) feet or as otherwise required
by the City Engineer. The minimum width for City drainage easements shall be as required
by the City Engineer. The width of easements for other utility providers, such as for gas,
electric, telephone or cable television, shall be as required by that particular entity. It shall
be the applicants responsibility to determine appropriate easement widths required by
other utility companies (also see Section 3.8). Wherever possible, easements shall be
centered or along front or side lot lines rather than across the interior or rear of lots,
particularly where no alleys will be provided behind the lots.
B. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way or channel, there shall be
provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with
such course and of such additional width as may be designated by the City Engineer,
subject to determination according to proper engineering considerations. The required
width shall conform to the requirements set forth by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and/or the City. Parallel streets or
parkways may be required adjacent to certain portions of creek or drainage ways to provide
maintenance access and/or public access to recreation areas (see Section 4). Other utilities
may be permitted within the drainage easement only if approved by the City Engineer and
any other applicable entity requiring the drainage easement.
C. No fences or other structures shall be located within a drainage easement.
D. Where alleys are not provided in a residential subdivision, a minimum ten (10) feet wide
utility easement shall be provided along the front of all lots, adjacent to and flush with the
street right-of-way line for the potential placement of utility facilities.
E. For new development, all necessary on-site easements shall be established on the
subdivision plat and not by separate instrument, and they shall be labeled for the specific
purpose, and to the specific entity, for which they are being provided. Examples include,
but are not limited to, the following: a water, sanitary sewer or drainage easement, which
is dedicated to the City for a water or sanitary sewer line or for a drainage structure; an
access easement, which is dedicated to the public for unrestricted access purposes; a fire
lane easement, which is dedicated to the City and its fire suppression and emergency
medical service providers for access purposes; an electrical, gas or telephone easement,
which is dedicated to the specific utility provider that requires the easement; and so on.

Section 3.4: Blocks
A. The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use
contemplated.
2. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes, setbacks and dimensions.
3. Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic and for
pedestrians or bicyclists traveling to a public park or school site within the
neighborhood.
B. Intersecting streets, which determine the lengths and widths of blocks, shall be provided at
such intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately, to provide adequate fire protection, and
to conform to customary subdivision practices. Where no existing subdivision or
topographical constraints control, the block lengths shall not exceed one thousand two
hundred (1,200) feet in length. Where no existing subdivision or topographical constraints
control, the blocks shall not be less than three hundred (300) feet in length; however, in
cases where physical barriers or property ownership creates conditions where it is
appropriate that these standards be varied, the length may be increased or decreased
(through issuance of variances or waiver by the City Engineer with plat approval) to meet
the existing conditions having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of traffic and
public safety.
Section 3.5: Sidewalks
A. Pedestrian concrete walkways (sidewalks) not less than four (4) feet wide or as required by
the Zoning Ordinance shall be required within all residential subdivisions on both sides of
residential and collector streets. Sidewalks shall be installed prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy for each abutting development as set forth in the City of Wylies
Design Manuals and Standard Construction Details. Sidewalks shall be constructed with
the residential and nonresidential construction.
B. The cost and provision of any perimeter sidewalks, such as along major thoroughfares, may
be escrowed as a part of a developers agreement, if approved by the City. The City has the
right, but not the obligation, to refuse escrow and to require paving of the sidewalks if, in
its sole opinion, immediate provision of the sidewalks is necessary for safe pedestrian
circulation or if it would otherwise protect the public health, safety or welfare.
C. As deemed appropriate by the City Engineer, sidewalks shall be constructed at time of
development of subdivision, or funds escrowed to City and will be reimbursed to developer
as sidewalks are constructed.

Section 3.6: Lots
A. Lots shall conform to the minimum requirements of the established zoning district, except
as noted in Subsection (g.) below.
B. Each lot shall front onto a dedicated, improved public street unless platted as an approved
private street subdivision in accordance with this Ordinance (see Section 3.1c.10.). Lot
width and access shall conform with the provisions of the City of Wylies Zoning
Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, and any other applicable City code or ordinance. Lot
access onto highway, arterial and collector streets is subject to approval by the City
Council, which may require a traffic study or other information prior to approval of the
preliminary plat in order to fully study all access issues. In all cases, lots shall have a
minimum of thirty (30) feet of frontage along a dedicated, improved street.
C. Irregular-shaped lots shall have sufficient width at the building line to meet lot width and
frontage requirements of the appropriate zoning district, and shall provide a reasonable
building pad without encroachment into front, side or rear yard setbacks or into any type of
easement. Also, the rear width shall be sufficient to provide access for all necessary
utilities, including access for driveways and solid waste collection when alleys are present.
In general, triangular, severely elongated or tapered, flag or panhandle lots shall be
avoided, and the City reserves the right to disapprove any lot which, in its sole opinion, will
not be suitable or desirable for the purpose intended.
D. Side lot lines shall be at ninety-degree angles or radial to street right-of-way lines to the
greatest extent possible. The City reserves the right to disapprove any lot which, in its sole
opinion, is shaped or oriented in such a fashion as to be unsuitable or undesirable for the
purpose intended, or which is not attractively or appropriately oriented toward its street
frontage.
E. Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where they may be essential to provide
separation of residential development from traffic arterials, as defined in Section 3.1, or to
overcome a specific disadvantage or hardship imposed by topography or other factors.
Where lots have double frontage, building setback lines shall be established for each street
side, and rear yard screening shall be provided in accordance with Section 5.7. Residential
lots shall not back onto any residential street or collector street within a residential area or
neighborhood.
F. No unsite septic tanks shall be used without specific approval by City Council.
Section 3.7: Building Lines
A. Front and street side building lines shall be shown on a concept plan and on any type of
plat for all lots, and shall be consistent with the Zoning Ordinance requirements for the
district in which the development is located, if subject to the Citys zoning regulations and
with any other applicable City ordinance. For property that is not subject to the Citys
zoning regulations, such as property that lies within the Citys extraterritorial jurisdiction,
the minimum front building line shall be as follows:
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
65
1. Any property or lot, whether residential or nonresidential, which fronts onto State
Highway 78, F.M. 544, or F.M. 1378: The front building setback shall be fifty (50) feet
along those roadways.
2. Any nonresidential or multiple-family property or lot which fronts onto any other
existing or future roadway: The front building setback shall be twenty-five (25) feet.
3. Any single-family residential parcel or lot which fronts onto any other existing or future
roadway: The front building setback shall be fifty (50) feet.
Section 3.8: Utility Services (not provided by the City of Wylie)
A. For purposes of this Section, the following meanings shall apply:
1. "Utility services" - The facilities of any person, firm or corporation providing electric,
natural gas, telephone, cable television, or any other such item or service for public use
approved but not provided by the City of Wylie.
2. "Feeder or feeder/lateral line" - High voltage supply electric lines volts that emanate
from substations used to distribute power through an area to an unspecified number of
customers.
3. "Lateral lines" - Those electric or telephone lines used to distribute power from a feeder
line to a single subdivision. These electric lines are normally connected to a feeder line
through a sectionalizing device such as a fuse.
4. "Service lines" - Those electric lines used to connect between the utilities' supply
system or lateral lines and the end users meter box.
B. All subdivision plats and engineering plans submitted to the City of Wylie for approval
shall provide for utility services such as electrical, gas, telephone and cable television
utility lines, including lateral or service distribution lines, and wires to be placed
underground. Feeder and other major transmission lines may remain overhead within the
appropriate easements. However, an applicant shall endeavor and, whenever practical, the
City shall require that feeder lines are placed away from major or minor thoroughfares or
arterials, as shown on the Thoroughfare Plan. Whenever practical, feeder lines which are
to be placed overhead shall not be placed along both sides of the street right-of-way.
Verification of acceptance of easement locations and widths by the utilities shall be
provided to the City, by the applicant, prior to final plat approval by the City Council, and
all easements shall be reviewed by the utility companies and by the City Engineer (for
those to the City) prior to granting final approval for any residential subdivision affected by
this Section. The applicant shall also, prior to final plat approval, provide a Letter of
Commitment from each utility provider, such as those providing electricity, gas, telephone
and cable television, who will serve the development that said utility providers will ensure
the provision of necessary infrastructure and service to all portions of the proposed
development prior to acceptance by the City. Failure to submit such Letters of
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
66
Commitment from utility providers shall constitute grounds for denial of the final plat
application on the basis that there is no written assurance that the development can be
served by essential utility services.
C. Each of the utility companies shall be responsible for developing administrative policies,
criteria for easement size, and cost reimbursement procedures for the installation and
extension of their underground utilities. Nothing herein shall prohibit or restrict any utility
company from recovering the difference in cost of overhead facilities and underground
utilities from the property owner in accordance with the provisions of such utility's
approved tariff. No utility company shall be required or permitted to begin construction of
underground facilities unless and until the property owner or developer of the subdivision
has made arrangements satisfactory to the specific utility company for the payment of such
difference between the cost of overhead facilities and underground facilities, as approved
by the City Engineer.
D. All electrical and telephone support equipment, including transformers, amplifiers and
switching devices necessary for underground installations, shall be pad- or groundmounted,
or shall be mounted underground and not overhead, unless the subdivision is
served from perimeter overhead electrical facilities. Pad- or ground-mounted utility
equipment shall be completely screened from view of any public roadway, and shall not be
located within any required visibility area, such as at street intersections or corners or at
driveway openings or within City right-of-way.
E. Temporary construction service may be provided by overhead electric lines and facilities
without obtaining a variance or waiver or special exception, provided that when the

Section 3.10: Storm Water Collection and Conveyance Systems
A. System Design Requirements. Drainage improvements shall accommodate runoff from the
upstream drainage area in its anticipated maximum "build-out" condition, and shall be
designed to prevent overloading the capacity of the downstream drainage system. The City
may require the phasing of development, the use of control methods such as retention or
detention, or the construction of off-site drainage improvements in order to mitigate the
impact of the proposed development. No storm water collection system shall be
constructed unless it is designed in accordance with the Citys Design Manuals by a
licensed professional engineer, and unless it is reviewed and approved by the City
Engineer. All plans submitted to the City Engineer for approval shall include a layout of
the drainage system together with supporting calculations for the design of the system.

C. No person, individual, partnership, firm or corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reclaim,
reroute or change the course or location of any existing ditch, channel, stream or drainage
way without first obtaining written permission of the City Engineer and any other
applicable agency (such as FEMA or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) having
jurisdiction. The City Engineer may, at his or her discretion, require preparation and
submission of a flood study for a proposed development if there are concerns regarding
storm drainage on the subject property or upstream or downstream from the subject
property. The costs of such study, if required, shall be borne by the developer.
D. In order to help reduce storm water runoff, and resulting erosion, sedimentation and
conveyance of nonpoint source pollutants, the layout of the street network, lots and
building sites shall, to the greatest extent possible, be sited and aligned along natural
contour lines, and shall minimize the amount of cut and fill on slopes in order to minimize
the amount of land area that is disturbed during construction. Development shall attempt to
balance out and fill required for the development.
E. No cross-street flow (i.e., perpendicular to traffic flow) of storm water runoff shall be
permitted unless approved by the City Engineer. When and if such drainage flow is
allowed, it must be across a concrete street (i.e., valley gutter) and as approved by the City
Engineer.
F. All storm water retention or detention facilities which are not located underground shall be
designed using materials and techniques as established in the Citys Design Manuals and
Standard Construction Details or as may be required by the City Engineer and shall be
maintained by a Homeowners Association.
G. Developer shall install on each storm inlet a permanent title, plaque or impression stating
that this inlet discharges into a river, creek, etc. in order to discourage dumping of debris
and toxics. (City shall adopt a design/logo for this.)

IV. PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES
Section 4.1: Areas for Public Use
4.1 A. The applicant shall give consideration to suitable and adequate sites for schools, parks,
playgrounds, and other areas for public use or service so as to conform with the
recommendations contained in the City's Comprehensive Plan; Park, Recreation and
Open Space Master Plan; and other applicable plans. Any provision for schools, parks
or other public facilities shall be indicated on the preliminary and final plat, and shall
be subject to approval by City Council.
Section 4.2: Protection of Drainage and Creek Areas
4.2 A. All creeks and drainage areas shall be preserved and protected in their natural condition
wherever possible, unless significant storm drainage improvements are required by the
City in these areas. All development adjacent to creeks and drainage areas shall be in
accordance with the Citys Design Manuals and Standard Construction Details, with
applicable policies in the Comprehensive Plan, and with any other City policies or
ordinances related to aesthetics or public enjoyment of creeks and waterways.
B. Definitions and Methodology for Determining the Floodway Management Area
(FMA). The definitions for "floodway" and "floodway fringe" shall correspond to
those set forth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). For purposes
of the National Flood Insurance Program, the concept of a floodway is used as a tool to
assist the local community in the aspect of flood plain management. Under this
concept, the area of the 100-year flood is divided into a floodway and floodway fringe.
The floodway is the channel of a stream plus any adjacent flood plain areas that must
be kept free of encroachment in order that the 100-year flood may be carried without
substantial increases in flood heights as defined by FEMA. The area between the
floodway and boundary of the 100-year flood is termed the floodway fringe. The
floodway fringe is the area which can be used for development by means of fill
according to FEMA and City engineering criteria.
For the purposes of this Ordinance, the Floodway Management Area (FMA) will
correspond to the floodway fringe, as defined by FEMA (or as may be modified per a
flood study approved by FEMA).
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
71
C. Areas Where an FMA is Required. All drainage areas or regulated floodways fringe as
referenced on the applicable flood boundary map (Flood Insurance Rate Map, or FIRM)
shall be included in the FMA. If FEMA does not specify a floodway fringe zone in any
of the creeks or their tributaries, it shall be the developers responsibility to establish
and identify the FMA. The determination shall be made by a licensed professional
engineer and approved by the City Engineer. Where improvements to a drainage area
are required by other ordinances of the City for the purpose of safety or other reasons
related to drainage, those ordinances shall also be observed. The FMA is intended to
apply to a creek or channel which is to remain open or in its natural condition. The
creek shall remain in its natural state unless improvements are permitted or required by
the City due to the pending development of properties adjacent to or upstream of the
required improvements.
D. Ownership and Maintenance of the FMA. The area determined to be the FMA shall be
designated on the preliminary plat. Approximate locations shall be shown on zoning
change requests and concept plans -- accurate locations of the FMA shall be established
on the preliminary plat and prior to site construction. At the City's option, the FMA
shall be protected by one of the following methods:
1. Dedicated to the City of Wylie for flood management purposes (flood areas shall
not be dedicated for parks or recreation purposes); or
2. Easement(s). Creeks or drainageways on tracts which have private maintenance
provisions, other than single- or two-family platted lots, can be designated as the
FMAs by an easement to the City on the preliminary plat (with the appropriate plat
language, as required by the City). Subdivisions with platted single-family or twofamily
lots may designate the FMA by easement provided there is adequate
maintenance provisions (such as by a mandatory homeowners association), but no
lots or portions of lots may be platted in the easement unless specifically allowed by
the City. The area designated as FMA may be identified by a tract number; or
3. Certain recreational uses normally associated with or adjacent to flood prone areas
(no structures allowed in the FMA), such as golf courses or certain types of parks.
The uses allowed shall be in conformance with the Zoning Ordinance and approved
by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council. Use of the FMA as
public parkland shall also require approval by the Citys Park Board.
Prior to acceptance of any drainage way as an FMA by the City, the area shall be
cleared of all debris and placed in a maintainable state. Floodway management
areas dedicated to the City shall be left in a natural state except those areas
designated for recreational purposes and unless storm drainage requirements do not
permit this to occur.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance
Adopted 2-25-03, Amended 7-24-07, Amended 9-10-19
72
E. Design Criteria. The following design criteria shall be required for development
adjacent to the FMA:
1. Adequate access shall be provided to and along the FMA for public and/or private
maintenance. An unobstructed area a minimum of twenty feet (20') wide with a
maximum 5:1 slope (five feet horizontal to one foot vertical), the length of the
floodway shall be provided adjacent to or within the FMA. On the opposite side of
the drainage area, an unobstructed area having a minimum width of five feet (5')
shall be provided.
2. Lots in a single-family, PD single-family, or duplex residential zoning district shall
not be platted within the FMA, and no more than fifty percent (50%) of the linear
length of the FMA (on each side) shall be allowed to have lots backing or siding
onto it. If lots back or side onto an FMA, at least two (2) reasonable points of
access to the FMA, each a minimum of twenty feet (20') in width, shall be provided.
Streets, alleys and open-ended cul-de-sacs may qualify as access points if designed
such that they are navigable by maintenance vehicles (e.g., alleys must be twentyfoot
width). All areas of the FMA shall be accessible from the access points and
shall be visible from access points. Lots used for multi-family dwellings may be
platted in the FMA if the FMA is identified as an easement and is maintained as
open space for use by the residents, and provided that access to the FMA is possible
by City maintenance vehicles, should that need arise. If the FMA is to be public
parkland, then adequate public access shall also be provided to it.
3. Public streets may be approved in the FMA by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council (if they conform to applicable engineering standards).
4. Public streets may be required to be constructed adjacent to some (or all) portions
of the FMA to allow access for maintenance or recreational opportunities, and/or to
allow increased visibility into creek areas for public safety and security purposes.
5. Alternate designs to facilitate equal or better access may be permitted if approved
by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.
F. Drainage areas which have been altered and are not in a natural condition can be
exempted from an FMA and this Section at the discretion of the City Council and upon
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission.

Section 4.3: Property Owners or Homeowners Associations
4.3 A. Applicability. When a subdivision contains either common open space or other
improvements which are not intended to be dedicated to the City of Wylie for public
use, such as private streets, a private recreation facility, landscaped entry features or
other private amenities, a property owners or homeowners association agreement
consistent with State and other appropriate laws, must be submitted to and approved by
the City Planner, and made a part of the final plat documents. The Conditions,
Covenants and Restrictions (CCRs) and the association documents, such as the articles
of incorporation and association by-laws, shall be submitted to the City for review and
approval along with the preliminary plat application, and shall be filed of record at the
appropriate County prior to final plat acceptable in order to ensure that there is an entity
in place for long-term maintenance of these improvements (also see Section 3.1c.10.
(e)). Said documents must, at a minimum, include provisions which allow the City to
take over the maintenance of common property, including but not limited to private
streets and private recreation facilities, using association funds, if such action becomes
necessary due to nonperformance or inaction by the association or if the association
goes defunct.
Provisions shall also be included which would, in the latter instance, convey ownership
of the private streets (if any) and all other common areas to the City, and which would
allow the City to remove any improvements or amenities from the common areas and
sell any buildable land area, as residential lots, to recoup the Citys expenses for
maintenance or demolition of the improvements. Any monies that remain after the City
has recovered all of its expenses shall be retained for future maintenance or upgrading
of the streets, common areas (if any remain), screening walls, or other improvements
within the subdivision. These provisions are not intended to allow the City to profit in
any way from taking over the associations responsibilities or funds; they are only
intended to allow the City to recoup its actual incurred expenses such that the general
public, the taxpayers of the City, does not have to bear these costs.
B. Membership. A property owners or homeowners association shall be an incorporated
non-profit organization operating under recorded land agreements through which:
1. Each lot owner within the described land area is automatically a mandatory
member; and
2. Each lot is automatically subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the
expenses for the property owners or homeowners association's activities, such as
maintenance of common open spaces or private streets, or the provision and upkeep
of common recreational facilities.
C. The homeowners association shall provide and maintain an address and telephone
contact with the City Secretarys office of the City of Wylie.

D. Legal Requirements. In order to assure the establishment of a proper property owners
or homeowners association, including its financing, and the rights and responsibilities
of the property or home owners in relation to the use, management and ownership of
common property, the subdivision plat, dedication documents, covenants, and other
recorded legal agreements must:
1. Legally create an automatic membership, non-profit property owners or
homeowners association;
2. Place title to the common property in the property owners or homeowners
association, or give definite assurance that it automatically will be so placed within
a reasonable, definite time;
3. Appropriately limit the uses of the common property;
4. Give each lot owner the right to the use and enjoyment of the common property;
5. Place responsibility for operation and maintenance of the common property in the
property owners or homeowners association;
6. Place an association charge on each lot in a manner which will both assure
sufficient association funds and which will provide adequate safeguards for the lot
owners against undesirable high charges;
7. Give each lot owner voting rights in the association; and
8. Must identify land area within the association's jurisdiction including but not
limited to the following:
(a) Property to be transferred to public agencies;
(b) The individual residential lots;
(c) The common properties to be transferred by the developer to the property
owners or homeowners association; and
(d) Other parcels.
9. Any governmental authority or agency, including, but not limited to, the City and
the County, their agents, and employees, shall have the right of immediate access to
the common elements at all times if necessary for the preservation of public health,
safety and welfare. Should the property owners or homeowners association fail to
maintain the common elements to City specifications for an unreasonable time, not
to exceed ninety (90) days after written request to do so, then the City shall have the
same right, power and authority to enforce the associations rules and to levy
assessments necessary to maintain the common elements. The City may elect to
exercise the rights and powers of the property owners or homeowners association or
its Board, or to take any action required and levy any assessment that the property
owners or homeowners association might have taken, either in the name of the
property owners or homeowners association or otherwise, to cover the cost of
maintenance (or the possible demolition, if such becomes necessary to preserve
public safety or to ease maintenance burden) of any common elements.

E. Protective Covenants. Protective covenants shall be developed which, among other
things, shall make the property owners or homeowners association responsible for:
1. The maintenance and operation of all common property;
2. The enforcement of all other covenants;
3. The administration of architectural controls (optional); and
4. Certain specified exterior maintenance of exterior improvements of individual
properties (optional).
The City is not responsible for enforcing protective covenants or deed restrictions.
F. The association may not be dissolved without the prior written consent of the City
Council.
G. No portion of the association documents pertaining to the maintenance of private streets
and alleys, and assessments therefore, may be amended without the written consent of
the City Council.
Section 4.4: Park Land & Public Facility Dedication
4.4 A. Areas for Public Use.
The applicant shall give consideration to suitable sites for parks, playgrounds and other
areas for public use so as to conform with the recommendations of the Comprehensive
Plan and Parks, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan. Any provision for parks and
public open space areas shall be indicated on the preliminary and final plat, and shall be
in accordance with the most recently approved Park Board Dedication Ordinance, and
subject to approval by the Citys Park Board and by City Council.
B. Park Land Dedication.
1. Any person, firm, or corporation offering a preliminary or final plat for
development of any area zoned and to be used for single-family, duplex, or
townhouse residential purposes within the City shall include on such preliminary
and final plat the dedication (to the City of Wylie) of land for public park purposes,
calculated at the rate of not less than five (5) acres of park land per one hundred
(100) ultimate units of such residential subdivision as required by the Park Land
Dedication Ordinance.
The location and size of public parks within the City shall be as approved by the
Park Board of the City of Wylie. That determination shall be based upon existing
circumstances at the time, and shall be in accordance with the Park Recreation and
Open Space Master Plan adopted by the City.
2. In instances where park land is unacceptable, unavailable or unsuitable for park
purposes, money in lieu of land shall be paid into a "park dedication fund"
maintained by the City of Wylie. Such money shall be in the amount required by
density sliding scale, and according to the fee schedule of the most recently
approved Park Land Dedication Ordinance.

3. The park dedication fund will be administered by the City to best benefit the
development, provided that the funds shall be expended within the park district in
which the park site is located. All sums deposited to the fund shall be accounted for
by the City of Wylie and expended for such purposes as land acquisition,
construction of improvements, and purchase of equipment.
4. The dedicated land required hereby shall be suitable and dedicated for park and
recreational purposes only. Such land shall be free of flood plain and major utility
easements, and shall be suitable for appropriate recreational and leisure activities.
All parkland offered for dedication under this Section shall meet the requirements
for location and for physical land characteristics outlined in the Parks, Recreation
and Open Space Plan and Park Land Dedication Ordinance. Lands occupied by
major utility easements and transmission lines shall not be accepted. Areas having
environmentally sensitive ecosystems, attractive views, topographical interest or
unique natural features shall be preferred and encouraged for parkland dedication.
C. Public Park Access.
Park land shall be easily accessible for the public and open to public view so as to benefit
area residents. A proposed subdivision adjacent to a public park or open space area shall
not be designed to restrict reasonable access or visibility into the park for example, shall
not have lots backing to the park land. Street connections between residential
neighborhoods shall be provided, wherever possible, to provide reasonable access to
parks and open space areas. Proposed access and public availability, both physical and
visual, of parkland shall be reviewed and approved by the Citys Park Board and by City
Council.

ordinances, including preparation and submittal of engineering plans and construction
inspection. The construction of all of the improvements required in this Ordinance
shall conform to the latest edition of the Citys Design Manuals and Standard
Construction Details, as may be amended, and to any other applicable City standards.
E. Changes or Amendments to the Design Manuals and Standard Construction Details and
Other Construction or Design Documents. The Design Manuals and Standard
Construction Details will, from time to time, require revisions and updates to allow for
changing construction technology. When changes are required, the Design Manuals
and Standard Construction Details may be amended by separate ordinance. It is the
applicants responsibility to be aware of, and to conform with, All Design Manuals and
Standard Construction Details requirements (including amendments) that are in place as
of the time a complete development application for a preliminary plat (including
required engineering/construction plans) is received by the City.
Section 5.2: Monuments
5.2 A. In all subdivisions and additions, monuments shall be established at the corner of each
block in the subdivision consisting of an iron rod or pipe not less than five-eighths (5/8)
inch in diameter and twenty-four inches (24") deep, and set six inches (6) below the
ground. Lot corner monuments shall be placed at all lot corners except corners which

Section 5.4: Street Names and Signs
5.4 A. Street names must be submitted to the City, for review and approval. Proposed street
names shall be submitted for review as a part of the preliminary plat application, and
shall become fixed at the time of approval of the preliminary plat. On the final plat,
street names shall not be changed from those that were approved on the preliminary
plat unless special circumstances have caused the major realignment of streets or a
proposed street name(s) is discovered to have already been used elsewhere in the City
(or some other similar eventuality). If additional street names are needed for the final
plat, then they must be submitted for review and approval by the City, the U.S. Postal
Service, and applicable emergency service providers (including 911) along with the
final plat application. A fee may be established by the City for the changing of street
names after approval of the preliminary plat.
B. Surnames of people or the names of corporations or businesses shall not be used as
street names, unless approved by the City Council. The City will maintain a list of
existing street names (and "reserved" street names that have been approved on a
preliminary plat), and will update the list as new streets are platted.
C. New street names shall not duplicate existing street names either literally or in a subtle
manner (for example, Smith Street vs. Smythe Street; Oak Drive vs. Oak Place vs. Oak
Court vs. Oak Circle; Cascade Drive vs. Cascading Drive); shall not be so similar as to
cause confusion between names (for example, Lakeside Drive vs. Lake Side Drive vs.
Lake Siding Drive); and shall not sound like existing street names when spoken (for
example, Oak Drive vs. Doak Drive vs. Cloak Drive; Lantern Way vs. Land Tern
Way). Suffixes shall be in agreement when a street is extended (for example Oak
Street cannot extend Oak Drive).
D. New streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets.
Streets crossing thoroughfares or other roadways shall bear the same name on both
sides of the thoroughfare, wherever practical. A cul-de-sac or loop that is named after
another thorough street (such as Oak Court or Oak Circle or Oak Trail) must actually
connect to the main street (Oak) from which the name is derived.
E. The property owner shall install all street name signs for the development. Each street

Section 5.8: Improvement of Adjacent (Perimeter) Streets and Utilities
5.8 A. When a proposed subdivision, whether residential or nonresidential, abuts on one or
both sides of an existing substandard street, or on a planned or future road as shown on
the Thoroughfare Plan, being substandard according to the then existing current
Thoroughfare Plan, the developer shall be required to improve his or her reasonable
share of the existing on-site facility as that term is defined herein, including appurtenant
sidewalks, screening and landscaping, storm drainage structures, water quality or
erosion controls, and other utilities as defined in Section 1.13, to bring the same to City
standards, or to replace it with a standard City street as determined by the traffic impact
analysis, if required, at no cost to the City.
B. The developers share of improvements to a substandard perimeter road shall be
twenty-five (25) feet of pavement (including curb, if any), which is approximately
equivalent to half of a collector street width (i.e., two through traffic lanes), along the
entire front footage of the subdivision, unless the traffic impact analysis, if required,
indicates that some other pavement width is needed to achieve and maintain an
acceptable level of service on the roadway. If the subdivision is to be located on both
sides of the roadway, twenty-five (25) feet of pavement shall be constructed by the
developer on each side of the road along the entire front footage of the subdivision on
each respective side of the road, unless the traffic impact analysis determines otherwise.
Design and construction of the roadway shall be in accordance with the Citys
Thoroughfare Plan (with respect to right-of-way width and general location, the Design
Manuals, and with any other applicable City codes and ordinances.
City of Wylie, Texas Subdivision Ordinance

84
Depending upon the specific roadway in question, and upon the traffic impact analysis
results, any oversizing above the twenty-five (25) feet width shall be borne by the City,
the County, the State or by some other entity. The City Council may, at its option,
accept escrow funds in lieu of immediate roadway construction if the subdivision
derives principal access from another improved roadway and if delaying construction
and improvement of the road will not harm or otherwise inconvenience neighboring
property owners or the general public.
C. Streets which dead-end at power lines or similar rights-of-way or easements, and which
are intended for future extension across these rights-of-way or easements, shall be
constructed in the right-of-way or easement for half the distance across the right-of-way
or easement, and shall be further restricted as set forth in Section 3.1 of this Ordinance.
As with any other dead-end street, a note shall be placed on the final plat clearly
labeling the dead-end streets that will, at some point, be extended across the power line
easement (or right-of-way), and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed
street stub, such as on the barricade, also stating that the street will be extended in the
future. Signage size and lettering shall be in accordance with the City requirements.
Section 5.9: Storm Drainage and Water Quality Controls
5.9 A. An adequate storm sewer system consisting of inlets, pipes and other underground
structures with approved outlets shall be constructed where runoff of storm water and
the prevention of erosion cannot be accomplished satisfactorily by surface drainage
facilities. Areas subject to flood conditions or inadvertent storm water retention, such
as standing or pooling water, as established by the City Engineer, will not be
considered for development until adequate drainage has been provided.
B. The criteria for use in designing storm sewers, culverts, bridges, drainage channels, and
drainage facilities shall conform to Section 3.10 of this Ordinance. In no case shall
drainage areas be diverted artificially to adjacent properties or across roadways. Storm
water drainage from one lot onto another shall not be allowed unless such does not pose
any harm or inconvenience to the downstream property owner(s), unless specifically
approved by the City Engineer, and unless the necessary off-site drainage easement is
procured on the affected property(s).
C. The developer shall ensure that all drainage improvements within public easements or
rights-of-way are functioning properly prior to the expiration of the maintenance bond.
The developer shall be responsible for removing any significant build-up of sediment or
debris from drainage improvements, with the exception of backlot and sidelot drainage
swales, at the eleventh month of the second year for the required two-year maintenance
bond for the applicable facilities. The City shall inspect the improvements to determine
any maintenance or correction of deficiencies at the conclusion of this period.

6.9 A. General Procedure. Construction inspection shall be supervised by the City Engineer.
Construction shall be in accordance with the approved engineering plans and the
Design Manuals and Standard Construction Details of the City of Wylie (and other
applicable codes and ordinances). Any change in design that is required during
construction should be made by the licensed professional engineer whose seal and
signature are shown on the plans. Another engineer may make revisions to the original
engineering plans if so authorized by the owner of the plans, and if those revisions are
noted on the plans or documents. All revisions shall be approved by the City Engineer.
If the City Engineer finds, upon inspection, that any of the required public

improvements are in accordance with engineering plans for the plat, and showing all
changes made in the plans during construction, and containing on each sheet an "asbuilt"
stamp bearing the signature and seal of the licensed professional engineer and the
date. One reproducible drawing of the utility plan sheets containing the as-built
information shall also be submitted. The engineer or surveyor shall also furnish the
City with a copy of the approved final plat and the engineering plans, if prepared on a
computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) system, in such a digital format (on disk)
that is compatible with the City Engineer's CADD system. When such requirements
have been met to the City Engineers satisfaction, the Planning Director shall thereafter
make a recommendation to the City Council for consideration of satisfactory
completion of the public improvements. Once the City Council votes its approval of
satisfactory completion, the City Engineer shall issue the Letter of Satisfactory
Completion.
Acceptance of the development shall mean that the developer has transferred all rights
to all the public improvements to the City for use and maintenance. The City Council
may, at its option, accept dedication of a portion of the required public improvements if
the remaining public improvements are not immediately required for health and safety
reasons, and if the property owner has posted a performance bond, letter of credit or
cash bond in the amount of one hundred (100) percent of the estimated cost of those
remaining improvements for a length of time to be determined by the City Council. If
the remaining public improvements are greater than ten thousand (10,000) dollars and
are not completed within the determined length of time, the City will impose a penalty
that equals ten (10) percent of the performance bond, letter of credit, or cash bond. The
obligation to complete the improvements remains with the developer, and all future
building permits or certificates of occupancy will be withheld until the improvements
are complete. If the remaining public improvements are less than ten thousand (10,000)
dollars, the developer shall pay the actual dollar amount. The length of time may be
extended due to inclement weather or unforeseen delays by mutual agreement between
the developer and the City.
Upon acceptance of the required public improvements, the City Engineer shall submit a
certificate to the developer stating that all required public improvements have been
satisfactorily completed.
Section 6.10: Deferral of Required Improvements
6.10 A. The City Council may, upon petition of the property owner and favorable
recommendation of the City Engineer, defer at the time of plat approval, subject to
appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all public improvements as, in its
judgment, are not required in the immediate interests of the public health, safety and
general welfare.

escrow his or her share of the costs (in accordance with City participation and
oversizing policies) of the future public improvements with the City prior to approval
of the plat, or the property owner may execute a separate improvement agreement
secured by a cash escrow or, where authorized, a letter of credit guaranteeing
completion of the deferred public improvements upon demand of the City.
Section 6.11: Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy
6.11 No building permit shall be issued for a lot, building site, building or use of a lot or

a concept plan or any type of plat, regardless of the action taken by the City Planning
and Zoning Commission and City Council thereon. Such fees shall be collected for the
purpose of defraying the costs of administrative, clerical, engineering, planning and
inspection services necessary to properly review and investigate plats and subdivision
construction.
C. Should a development proposal or plat application lapse or expire, or should it be
denied by the Commission or the Council, then that application ceases "pending" status
and the project, and its corresponding series of development approvals and permits,
shall be deemed to be ended, or "completed". Any re-application for any type of
development approval for that property shall be considered commencement of a new
project, and shall be accompanied by new application materials, including new
submission fees, and shall conform to all applicable City ordinances in effect at the
time of submission of the new application.
D. All required fees, unless specifically stated otherwise herein, shall be paid as required
in other sections of this Ordinance. Inspection fees may be paid at the time the actual
inspection is made of the project.
