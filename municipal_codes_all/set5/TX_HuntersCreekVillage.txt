PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hunters Creek Village, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2002 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2002 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and K. Barrington, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Deborah L. Loesch, City Secretary, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

ARTICLE XII. - FLOOD PLAIN ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 10-120. - Generally. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has, in Texas Water Code § 16.311 et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before start of construction of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for the improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. For full requirements, see section 60.65 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(6)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided the relevant factors in subsection (c)(2) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance shall be increased proportionately. 
(7)  Upon consideration of the factors noted in this section and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article (see section 10-219(c)). 
(8)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(9)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(10)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(11)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that: (i) the criteria outlined in subsection (d)(9) are met; and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings shall not be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices unless they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. 
This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood; shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation, and shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on sites within an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4) shall be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM shall either:

b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of section 10-222(c)(1), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (b)(4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(c)  Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivisions shall be consistent with section 10-219(b), (c) and (d). 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet development permit requirements of section 10-221 (c) and section 10-222(c), and the provisions of this section. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 10-221(b) or section 10-222(b)(8). 
(4)  All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(d)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding, AO/AH zones. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 10-221 (b) are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 10-222(c)(1)a are satisfied.

    Circumference means the circumference of the trunk of a tree measured at a height of 41/2 feet above the ground using an ordinary tape measure or diameter tape. If the tree has unusual swells in the trunk at measurement height, measurement shall be taken either below or above the swell at the smallest trunk diameter as close to 41/2 feet as possible. 
    Critical root zone means the area within the drip line of a tree. 
    Development activity means construction or preparation for construction, and includes grading, clearing and grubbing, and demolition of existing structures. 
    Drip line means an imaginary circle drawn around a tree extending to the outer tips of the largest branches. 
    Impervious material means concrete, tar, asphalt, brick pavers or similar paving materials. 
    Minimum required density means, for a particular lot: 
(1)  Seven protected or replacement trees, of which at least three must be located in the front yard, plus one additional protected or replacement tree for every 1,000 square feet of area in excess of 22,500 square feet, up to a maximum of seven additional protected or replacement trees per lot, provided, however, that where a lot contains areas that are not suitable for the location of trees because of topology or other natural features, those unsuitable areas shall not be included in calculating the number of additional protected or replacement trees required in addition to the first seven; 
(2)  For a lot that is less than 20,000 square feet in area: a) the minimum number of protected or replacement trees may be reduced to five where the collective circumference of the protected and replacement trees equals 375 inches or more; and b) the minimum number of protected or replacement trees in the front yard may be reduced to two protected or replacement trees where the collective circumference of the protected and replacement trees in the front yard equals 150 inches or more. 
(3)  A protected or replacement tree that is located within the public street right-of-way shall not be counted in determining whether a lot has the minimum required density of protected or replacement trees. 
    Professional means a person with a professional working knowledge of trees, and includes architects, engineers, landscape or tree professionals, arborists, surveyors and any city official approved by the city council. 
    Property owner means the owner of a lot, tract, parcel or other site, and includes the owner's authorized agents.

(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 5-20-2008; Ord. No. 722, § 1, 7-15-2008; Ord. No. 779, § 1, 11-8-2011) 
Sec. 18-20. - Preservation and protection of trees. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of this section is to encourage site planning which furthers the preservation of trees and natural areas by these methods: to protect trees during construction; to facilitate site design and construction which contribute to the long-term viability of existing trees; to control the unnecessary removal of larger trees; and to require on-site replacement of larger trees that must be removed during development activities. It is the further intent of this article to achieve the following broader objectives: 
(1)  Protect healthy trees and preserve the natural, ecological, environmental and aesthetic qualities of the city; 
(2)  Protect and increase the value of properties within the city; 
(3)  Prohibit the indiscriminate clearing or clear cutting of property; 
(4)  Maintain and enhance a positive image toward the city; 
(5)  Prevent the unnecessary removal of protected trees and to provide for remediation where removal is unavoidable. 
(a-1)  Replacement. Given the conduciveness of the city's topography and natural conditions to arboreal viability, and in light of the minimum lot size requirements applicable to each lot in the city, it is the further intent of this article to achieve the foregoing objectives by requiring the replacement of trees as specified in this article solely through enforcing specific performance and not by imposing any tree mitigation fee or similar monetary charge. 
(b)  Tree removal permit required. It is unlawful for any person to remove or to intentionally, or with criminal negligence, cause serious damage to any protected tree within the city without having first obtained from the city a tree removal permit. 
(1)  Removal in connection with site development or construction. 
a.  Generally. A property owner who seeks a permit to remove one or more protected trees in order to develop or construct improvements on a site must submit to the building official a current tree survey and tree disposition and protection plan. The city shall grant a tree removal permit if the applicant demonstrates that, for each protected tree that is to be removed, the removal is necessary in order to make a reasonable use of the site, and that all alternatives to removal, including redesign of the proposed improvements, have been considered. 
b.  Restrictions on additional removals. 
1.  Where a permit is granted to remove protected trees in order to develop or construct a particular improvement on a site, and the subject trees are actually removed, no permit shall be granted for the removal of additional protected trees from the site for the construction of a similar improvement for a period of five years following the date the first permit was issued. 
2.  For example, if a permit is granted for the removal of trees for the construction of a proposed new residence and the property owner, or his successor in title, elects not to build that proposed residence, any new proposed residence on the site must be designed to fit within the area from which protected trees have been removed and cannot require the removal of additional protected trees. 
3.  The purpose of this provision is to prevent the unnecessary removal of protected trees based on speculative construction or development plans and to encourage property owners to seek removal of trees only when the proposed improvements will actually be constructed. 
4.  For the purposes of this article, the filing of an application for removal of protected trees for the construction of a particular improvement is deemed to be an admission, by the applicant, that a reasonable improvement of the type desired can be constructed on the site without removing any additional protected trees. 
(2)  Other removal. 
a.  A property owner who otherwise seeks a permit to remove a protected tree must file an application with the city describing the location, species, and size of the protected tree that is to be removed and explaining the reason that removal is desired. The city shall grant a removal permit if the applicant demonstrates that: 
1.  The protected tree in question is severely damaged, diseased or dead; 
2.  The protected tree constitutes an unreasonable impediment to the use and enjoyment of the site because of its location or size; 
3.  The tree is of an undesirable species that has characteristics that interfere with the property owner's use and enjoyment of the site; 
4.  The removal of the tree is necessary for safety reasons including, but not limited to, a branch overhanging a structure, a severely leaning tree, or a tree with a seriously damaged root system that poses a reasonable threat of falling. 
b.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a property owner is not required to obtain a permit to remove a single protected tree that is severely damaged, diseased or dead or that must be removed for safety reasons, including but not limited to, a branch overhanging a structure, a severely leaning tree, or a tree with a seriously damaged root system that poses a reasonable threat of falling. 
(3)  Emergency removal. Where the dangerous condition of a protected tree requires its immediate removal to protect against a serious and immediate risk to health, safety or property, a property owner may remove a protected tree without first obtaining a permit. However, within seven calendar days after removing the tree, the property owner must file with the building official a written statement describing the protected tree by size, species, and location and explaining the emergency conditions that required its immediate removal. 
(c)  Tree survey and tree disposition and protection plan required. Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) below, for small projects, no permit shall be granted for any site work or construction activity in the city unless and until a current tree survey and tree disposition and protection plan for the subject lot, and any property within ten feet of the subject lot, has been submitted to the city and approved by the urban forester. 
(1)  Small projects exception. Neither a tree survey nor a tree disposition and protection plan is required for projects that meet the following requirements as determined by the building official: 
a.  The construction work or other activity contemplated by the permit is of a type and scope that presents little risk of serious damage to any protected trees on the site; and 
b.  The owner, or his authorized agent, has certified to the city in writing that no protected trees will be removed or seriously damaged during the construction work or other activity. 
(2)  Single tree exception. Neither a tree survey nor a tree disposition and protection plan is required where a property owner seeks to remove a protected tree for any of the reasons set out in subsection 18-20(b)(2). 
(d)  Utility right-of-way maintenance. 
(1)  An employee of a public utility, or an authorized contractor working in a dedicated public right-of-way, drainage or utility easement, may in the course of business, prune that portion of a tree, including a protected tree, that prohibits the safe construction, operation, repair or maintenance of a service line or facility. Trees must be pruned no more than is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair or maintenance of the service line or facility, and any pruning shall be in accordance with the specifications set forth by the National Association of Arborists. No tree permit, tree survey or tree disposition and protection plan is required for work performed under these circumstances. 
(2)  Trees, including protected trees, that are outside the public right-of-way or utility easement, that are severely damaged, diseased or dead and that present a risk of damaging a public utility service line or facility may be removed by an employee or authorized contractor of the public utility whose service line or facility is at risk of damage, provided that utility has the consent of the tree owner. Such work will require a permit for removal, but no tree survey or tree disposition and protection plan is required. No permit fee shall be charged for issuance of a permit under this subsection. 
(e)  Tree replacement. 
(1)  Generally. A property owner must maintain the minimum required density of protected and replacement trees on the owner's lot at all times and, if the lot falls below the minimum required density because of the loss or removal of a tree or trees, regardless of cause, the property owner shall plant and maintain a sufficient number of replacement trees to meet the minimum required density. If a lot fall below the minimum required density because of the loss of one or more protected or replacement trees, the property owner shall, within 30 days after the removal or loss, plant a sufficient number of replacement trees to restore the minimum required density. 
(2)  Special rule for removals related to driveway construction. Where protected trees are removed from a front yard in order to relocate or expand a pre-existing driveway, the property owner must plant one replacement tree in the front yard for every protected tree that is removed from the front yard. Tree replacement is required under this provision regardless of whether replacement would have been required under subsection (e)(1), above. 
(3)  Location requirements for new home construction. Where a new home is to be constructed on a site, the tree disposition and protection plan must include provisions for preserving or planting and maintaining at least three protected or replacement trees in the front yard. 
(4)  Timing of planting. Any replacement tree required under this article shall be planted within 30 days after the loss or removal of the tree it is to replace, except in the case of new construction. Provided however, that the building official may grant a written extension if the property owner: 
a.  Applies for the extension in writing, and within 30 days after the loss or removal; and 
b.  Demonstrates that replacement within 30 days is not practical because of ongoing construction or weather conditions. 
In the case of new construction, the replacement tree must be planted before a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
(5)  Exceptions to replacement requirements. No replacement tree shall be required if because of the topography or natural conditions of the lot, or the location of permitted structures and other improvements to the lot, it is not reasonably possible to plant and maintain an otherwise required replacement tree. The city council shall be the final authority to determine whether planting a replacement tree is reasonably possible. 
(6)  Replacement of trees that die within five years after construction activity. A property owner shall plant replacement trees for any protected trees that die within five years after the date of completion of any outside construction activity on the property, regardless of whether the lot would have the minimum required density without the replacement. Provided however, that no replacement shall be required if the property owner can demonstrate that the death of the tree or trees was not related to the construction activity. 
(f)  Protection of trees during site preparation or construction activity. Protected trees, whether located on the subject site or within ten feet of the subject site, must be protected from serious damage during construction activity in accordance with the following requirements, provided, however, that the urban forester may allow modification of the requirements upon a determination that unique circumstances exist and that a strict application of the requirements would result in undue hardship to the owner of the site. 
(1)  Prohibited activities. The following activities are prohibited within the drip line of any protected tree: 
a.  Material storage. No materials intended for use in construction accumulated due to excavation or demolition shall be placed within the limits of the drip line of any protected tree. 
b.  Equipment cleaning; liquid disposal. No equipment shall be cleaned, and no liquids other than clean water shall be deposited, within the limits of the drip line of any protected tree. Prohibited liquids include but are not limited to paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or other materials. 
c.  Tree attachments. No signs, wires or other attachments, other than those of a protective nature and that have been approved in the tree disposition and protection plan, shall be attached to any protected tree. 
d.  Vehicular traffic. No vehicle, construction equipment or other parking shall be allowed within the limits of the drip line of any protected tree. 
e.  Trespassing; trash. Trespassing or throwing trash into a protective fence area is prohibited. 
(2)  Required procedures. The following procedures shall be followed prior to and during any development activity on a site until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the city: 
a.  Protective fencing; root protection. Unless otherwise approved in the tree disposition plan, the critical root zone of each tree or group of trees to be preserved must be enclosed by a protective fence during all development activity and until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the city. Each protective fence shall be marked with signs stating "OFF LIMITS" and "NO TRASH" (or equivalent) in both English and Spanish. 
b.  Mulch. If development activity is to take place within the critical root zone of any tree, the protective fence shall cover the area on which no development activity is to take place, and the balance of the critical root zone for such tree or group of trees must be covered with at least six inches of organic or wood chip mulch and covered with three-fourths inch plywood or road boards in order to protect the roots from soil compaction. 
c.  Fence, mulch removal. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove any portion of any protective fence or mulch and road boards for any period of time during any development activity, unless otherwise specified in the tree disposition plan. 
d.  Tree flagging. All trees to be removed from the site shall be flagged with orange vinyl tape (flagging) wrapped around the main trunk at a height of four feet or more. After receipt of the tree removal permit, the owner of the site or his agent shall paint with orange paint an "X" on the tree approved for removal at a height of four feet or more so that the paint is visible to workers on foot or operating heavy equipment. 
e.  Trunk protection. In situations where a tree remains in the immediate area of intended development activity, the tree shall be protected by enclosing the entire circumference of the tree's trunk with lumber, at least eight feet high, banded by wire or other means that does not damage the tree. 
f.  Construction pruning. If a tree has a low canopy, or limbs that may be broken during the course of construction, and if specified and approved by the urban forester in the tree disposition plan, the obtrusive limbs may be cut. Pruning should be done according to the National Association of Arborists Standards. 
g.  Supplemental feeding, watering. Protected trees should receive supplemental water during times of drought or low rainfall. Plans for feeding and watering must be prepared by a professional, who is retained by the owner or his agent and must be included in the tree disposition and protection plan. 
(3)  Design constraints. Design constraints may dictate that in certain circumstances some protected trees will have some encroachment of their critical root zone. The following is the minimum design criteria allowed within the critical root zone of a protected tree: 
a.  Change of grade. In the event that grade changes must be made around a protected tree, the following procedures shall be followed unless otherwise approved in the tree disposition plan: 
1.  No cut or fill of the ambient grade greater than two inches shall be located close to the trunk of a protected tree if the cut or fill covers more than one-half of the radius of the critical root zone. If these provisions cannot be complied with, the following provisions shall apply: 
(i)  Increase in grade. The owner shall construct tree wells around the drip line of a tree which shall be of a design that provides for proper aeration and drainage of the critical root zone; or 
(ii)  Decrease in grade. The owner shall construct retaining walls around the drip line of a tree to mitigate cuts. 
2.  If development activity causes standing water or wet soil conditions which are detrimental to a species of tree on a site or adjacent property, adequate drainage shall be provided in the tree disposition and protection plan in order to prevent suffocation and/or root rot of the affected tree. 
b.  Underground utilities. Boring for the installation of underground utilities is permitted under protected trees in certain circumstances. The minimum depth of the bore shall be 30 inches. In special circumstances approved by the urban forester, trenching for underground utilities may be permitted with respect to all such protected trees. If utility trenching is approved, the following procedures must be adhered to: 
1.  Root pruning shall take place at least two weeks prior to any trenching; 
2.  Root pruning shall be supervised by a professional; 
3.  The utility trench must be backfilled less than 24 hours after it is dug; and 
4.  A root remediation schedule must be addressed in the tree disposition plan. 
c.  Irrigation systems. Irrigation systems shall be designed to avoid trenching across the critical root zone of any protected tree. 
d.  Paving and impervious material. A maximum of 25 percent of the critical root zone of a protected tree may be covered with impenetrable material, such as concrete, tar or asphalt. 
e.  Procedures when using impervious materials. If the design plans for the site call for any impervious material over any part of the critical root zone of a protected tree, the following procedures shall be adhered to: 
1.  Root pruning shall be done six inches to one foot behind the proposed curb line and shall take place at least two weeks prior to any fill or cut; 
2.  Root pruning and necessary limb pruning shall be supervised by a professional; 
3.  A plastic vapor barrier of construction grade shall be installed between the roots of a protected tree and the impervious material so as to inhibit leaching of lime into the soil; and 
4.  A root remediation schedule must be addressed in the tree disposition plan.

Sec. 18-21. - Tree replacement payments and fund. 
(a)  A property owner who removes a protected tree pursuant to a valid permit, or in an emergency situation, shall provide a replacement tree, as and to the extent required under section 18-20(e). 
(b)  A property owner who removes a protected tree in violation of this chapter shall provide a replacement tree of the same caliper size and species as the tree that was illegally removed. If it is not feasible to provide a replacement tree of the same caliper size as the protected tree that was removed, the property owner shall provide a replacement tree of the same species as the protected tree and having the largest caliper size (not less than three inches) that is feasible. The measurement of diameter shall be made at a point on the trunk of the tree that was six inches above the ambient grade immediately before the protected tree was removed. The city council shall be the final authority to determine whether planting a replacement tree of any particular caliper size is feasible.

ARTICLE III. - SOUTHERN PINE BEETLE INFESTATION 

Sec. 18-54. - Generally. 
(a)  Public nuisance declaration. Any pine tree within the city limits which is infested with the insect known as the southern pine beetle, as determined by a representative of the city, a representative of the state forest service or an entomologist is declared to be a public nuisance. 
(b)  Permitting, maintaining infested pine prohibited. It shall be unlawful for the owner of any lot or parcel of land within the city to permit or maintain on any such lot or parcel of land, any pine tree infested with southern pine beetles; and it shall be the duty of the owner of any such lot or parcel of land upon which is situated a pine tree infested with southern pine beetles to abate such infestation and public nuisance either by chemical treatment of the bark of such tree or by the felling of such tree and subsequent chemical treatment of its bark, whichever shall be required. 
(c)  Authorized entry for inspections. The city building inspector and such other officers, employees and agents of the city as may be designated by the city council are authorized and empowered to enter upon any lot or parcel of land within the city, at any reasonable time, for the purpose of inspecting any pine tree situated thereon and may remove or cause to be removed a portion of the bark to determine if such tree is infested with southern pine beetles.

(1)  Minimum size of pipes. All underground conveyance shall be provided by an eight inch diameter or larger pipe or its equivalent unless designed by an engineer. 
Exception: A minimum four inch diameter pipe can be used for single catch basins or downspouts without being designed by an engineer as long as the contributing area does not exceed 400 square feet. 
(2)  Minimum size of downspouts. Any downspouts that are connected to the yard drainage system and that capture over ten percent of water falling on the roof surface area shall have a diameter of at least six inches. 
(3)  Engineered design required for larger lots. All yard drainage on lots over 22,500 square feet must be designed by an engineer. 
(4)  Tie-ins. All yard drainage must tie into an existing public storm sewer inlet when there is an inlet within 200 feet of the property and access is available through a public right-of-way or drainage easement, with the following exceptions. 
a.  When there is no inlet within 200 feet and a curb cut is the desired relief into the public right-of-way or drainage easement, it must be done as prescribed by the city standard detail. 
b.  When the existing drainage outfall is to a natural ravine, ditch or bayou, the outfall system must be designed by an engineer so as to protect against erosion. Drainage to a natural ravine, ditch or bayou shall not exceed pre-development flows. Any outfall modifications require county flood control approval where the outfall is located within a drainage way under the jurisdiction of the county flood control district.

(1)  The property owner must provide engineered drawings signed by an engineer licensed in the state that demonstrate that the storm water storage and conveyance provided for the proposed system are equal to or greater than that of the existing system. 
(2)  The proposed system must maintain existing culvert sizes for all existing driveway culverts in order to maintain existing flow conditions and provide adequate inlet capacity into the enclosed system to accommodate the surface drainage of the 100-year rainfall event from the adjacent road and private property into the system. 
(3)  The property owner must secure approval of engineered drawings from the Memorial Village Water Authority (MVWA) to confirm that water and sewer infrastructure impacts (mains and services) have been considered and accommodated in the proposed project. 
(4)  During construction, the owner must arrange for a pre-cover up inspection by the city engineer. 
(b)  Maintenance and replacement required. The owner of the abutting lot shall maintain the replacement drainage system as necessary to insure that it operates as designed and does not become obstructed with debris. If the system fails to operate as designed for any reason, the home owner shall restore it to proper operating condition or remove the system and reconstruct the open ditch section. 
(c)  City's ownership. Once the system is installed in the right-of-way it becomes the property of the city for all purposes, subject only to the abutting property owner's obligation to maintain it. The city reserves the right to modify, replace, or remove the system as it deems necessary in its sole discretion.

Chapter 43 - COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 

Sec. 43-1. - 2012 comprehensive plan. 
(a)  Purpose of comprehensive plan. This comprehensive plan is adopted, under authority of V.T.C.A. Local Government Code, ch. 213, as a present statement of policy by the City of Hunters Creek Village (the "city") and as a guide for future land use, capital improvements and other programs within the city including cooperative efforts with other governmental agencies and the private sector. 
    This plan may be amended or revised as deemed appropriate by the city council. This plan may be reviewed at any time by the city's planning and zoning commission on its own motion or at the direction of the city council. Whenever such review is undertaken, the planning and zoning commission shall submit a written report to the city council which shall include any recommended changes to the plan. 
(b)  Comprehensive plan. 
(1)  General. The City of Hunters Creek Village is a fully developed residential community with a "complementing" business community. One of its most important attributes is its ability to protect the integrity of its residential neighborhoods through its zoning ordinance and other land use regulations. The city is located, along with the other memorial villages, in an area that is surrounded on all sides by the City of Houston and is almost exclusively residential in character. The only commercial activity in the city is located along the Interstate 10 corridor which forms the northern boundary of the city. The city and its residential community are served by commercial and industrial uses that are located in the City of Houston and other neighboring cities and there is no need to expand the city's current business district. The most important goal of this comprehensive plan is the preservation of the city's high quality residential neighborhoods and the protection of those neighborhoods from the negative effects of urban development. 
Residential zoning will be employed generally to maintain and improve the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the City of Hunters Creek Village by limiting population density, land use, lot size, height and setbacks of buildings and other improvements and by regulating swimming pools, parking, fences and the use of signs, and by enacting such other regulations as may be permitted by law. 
Zoning in the business districts will be employed generally to promote business activity while minimizing any adverse effects of commercial development on the residents, citizens and inhabitants of the City of Hunters Creek Village, and providing a buffer zone between the business district and the residential district. 
Zoning in the City of Hunters Creek Village is also appropriate for limiting visual pollution, land use, lot size, height and setbacks of buildings and other improvements, including but not limited to regulating swimming pools, parking, site drainage, fences, the use of signs, and the accumulation of refuse in the business district. In addition such other regulations as may be permitted by law should be enacted to protect the residential district and to provide a pleasant and healthful environment in the business district. 
(2)  Residential district R. The city will continue to protect existing single-family residential neighborhoods and existing residences through appropriate land use controls including zoning and other ordinances regulating lot size, use of land and improvements, height and setbacks, swimming pools, parking, fences and the use of signs. These neighborhoods will also be protected and improved by appropriate and timely investments in maintenance and replacement of public infrastructure. 
Any new development or redevelopment in the business districts along Interstate 10 should be designed and located so as to minimize any adverse effect on existing residential uses and to ensure that new development constitutes a benefit to the city's residential neighborhoods. 
Ingress and egress to all development in the business district should be designed so that traffic to and from the development which originates in or is destined to points outside of the City of Hunters Creek Village will not utilize local residential streets. 
(3)  Business district B. The area along Interstate 10 is subject to substantial noise, visual pollution, air pollution and the heavy traffic associated with a major highway and transportation corridor. The city will continue to exercise its regulatory authority to mitigate the negative effects of these factors on nearby residential areas. Any new development or redevelopment in the existing business district should be designed to be complimentary to the adjoining residential areas of the city and to mitigate any traffic, water, sewer, flood, or other conditions adverse to the community. 
Regulations should be tailored to encourage property owners to utilize their property to the maximum extent possible in order to produce adequate revenue to fund the cost to the city of providing necessary services. 
(4)  Public services. Existing public services in the city are adequate to preserve the high quality of the city's residential neighborhoods and its small business district. It is not anticipated that significant expansion and/or upgrading of existing public facilities will be necessary in the future. However, the city will need to continue its program of periodic replacement of public facilities as those facilities reach their useful life. Present facilities in the business district are appropriate for maintenance or adequate service levels to business and commercial interests presently existing in the business districts. Any new development, renovation or replacement of present businesses should be accomplished only if there is appropriate and adequate assurance that the proposed new development will provide sufficient upgrading, renovation or addition of appropriate facilities necessary to serve such new development and otherwise not adversely impact present residential development or existing business development. 
The city's forest canopy and existing green space contributes to the health, safety and well-being of the residents of the city and to the overall quality of life within the city and efforts should be made to preserve existing trees and green space through appropriate land use regulations and maintenance of public areas. Efforts should be made to educate and inform the city's residents on the benefits of maintaining the city's forest canopy and green space. 
The city should encourage the development and maintenance of privately owned landscaped green areas in its residential neighborhoods. Additional hike and bike trails should be built and existing trails maintained. To these ends citizen participation should be sought. 
(5)  Traffic. Existing traffic circulation systems in the city should be maintained and be upgraded as needed with adequate repairs provided in order to insure good and serviceable streets. Every effort should be made to preserve the integrity of the residential neighborhoods within the city. No zoning ordinance should be adopted which encourages arterial street circulation within the residential neighborhoods of the city. 
(6)  Implementation. The city's land use regulations should provide for protection of the rights and interests of neighboring landowners and the general public. These rights and interests should be protected by controlling development which could create or significantly increase glare, light, shade, traffic, noise, noxious fumes, trash accumulation, or rainwater runoff to other landowners. 
Every effort should be made by the city to encourage active participation by all citizens, citizen groups, business owners and business organizations in the planning and development of the City of Hunters Creek Village.

3.  The board may condition the granting of a special exception as necessary to protect the interests of abutting property owners and to further the intent of the setback requirements. Conditions may include: a) requiring the applicant to design the pool or related improvements to minimize the impact of its location or use on neighboring property owners; b) requiring the applicant to take necessary measures to protect and maintain any valuable trees that served as a basis for granting the special exception; and c) such other conditions as the board deems necessary.

Where lots are located at the corner of two streets the required front yard shall be provided on one of the two streets. Once a front yard has been established for a particular lot, it may not be changed unless the Planning & Zoning Commission approves a replat of the lot that establishes a front building line reflecting the desired change. For purpose of this section a front yard is established if: 
i)  A front building line is designated on a subdivision plat; or 
ii)  A residence has been constructed on the lot. 
b.  Side yard. There shall be two side yards on each lot, having a combined width of not less than 35 feet; neither of such side yards shall be less than 15 feet in width. A side yard adjacent to a side street shall not be less than 20 feet in width.

(1)  Generally. Every single-family dwelling must have at least a 200 square foot garage; or a 200 square foot carport and a 100 square foot completely enclosed storage room with an outside door. 
(2)  Setbacks . Subject to the following exceptions, all automobile shelters must meet the setback requirements of the dwelling; and the opening of the automobile shelter shall face the rear of the lot, provided, however: 
a.  Reduced setbacks for certain detached garages . A garage, if not attached to the dwelling other than by a breezeway, may be located not closer than five feet from the rear lot line and not closer than five feet distance from the side lot line unless such line abuts a street, in which event the garage shall be located at least 20 feet from such side street line. In order to qualify for the reduced side and rear setbacks, a detached garage must:

ARTICLE IV. - NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES 

Sec. 44-217. - Intent. 
    Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. It is the intent of this chapter to permit those nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district, except as more specifically set forth in this chapter. Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and upon which actual building construction had been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastening in a permanent manner. 
(Ord. No. 340, § 9-1, 5-20-1980) 
Sec. 44-218. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
(a)  Generally. In district R, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot lawfully created and of record on March 25, 1955, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area, width and depth that are generally applicable in such district. If two or more lots or combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership were of record on the effective date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot area and width, the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of such parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot area and width requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with area or width below the requirements established herein. 
(b)  Building regulations for nonconforming lots. 
(1)  Definitions. 
a.  Lot. As used herein, the term "lot" shall mean a lot, tract, or parcel of land designated on a subdivision plat duly filed in the map or plat records of the county, or any lot, tract, or parcel of land held in separate ownership and described by metes and bounds upon a deed duly recorded and registered in the deed records of the county, that existed prior to the date of adoption of applicable subdivision regulations of the city. 
b.  Nonconforming lot. As used herein, "nonconforming lot" is a lot that, because of its area, width or depth, does not comply with the regulations established under the terms of this chapter. 
(2)  Minimum required yards. The minimum yard requirements/building lines for all nonconforming lots lawfully created on or after March 25, 1955, or, in the case that neither deed restrictions recorded prior to March 25, 1955, nor a plat recorded prior to March 25, 1955, establish building lines/a front yard, a side yard, or a rear yard, shall be as follows: 
a.  For lots created on or before March 25, 1955, with applicable deed restrictions of platted building lines. The required front yard, side yard and rear yard for nonconforming lots legally created and lying within a subdivision which were in existence on March 25, 1955, and in separate ownership, shall be the yard requirements/building lines established in the recorded deed restrictions applicable to such lots as such deed restrictions existed on March 25, 1955, or the building lines established on a plat recorded prior to March 25, 1955. If the original deed restrictions conflict with the building lines established in a recorded plat, the greater distance or depth shall apply. If neither recorded deed restrictions nor a recorded plat establish building lines/a front yard, a side yard, or a rear yard, the required yard shall be as set forth in subsection (a)(1)b.1-3 of this section. 
b.  For all other nonconforming lots shall be as follows: 
1.  Minimum required front yard. 
Lots less than 10,000 sq. ft. 18 ft. Lots 10,000 sq. ft.-14,999 sq. ft. 25 ft. Lots 15,000 sq. ft.-17,999 sq. ft. 30 ft. Lots 18,000 sq. ft.-19,999 sq. ft. 40 ft. Lots 20,000 sq. ft.-22,499 sq. ft. 50 ft.  
The required front yard on a turn circle shall be as follows: 
Lots less than 10,000 sq. ft. 18 ft. Lots 10,000 sq. ft.-14,999 sq. ft. 20 ft. Lots 15,000 sq. ft.-17,999 sq. ft. 25 ft. Lots 18,000 sq. ft.-19,999 sq. ft. 30 ft. Lots 20,000 sq. ft.-22,499 sq. ft. 35 ft.  
2.  Minimum required side yards. 
i.  Lots 20,000 sq. ft.-22,499 sq. ft.: There shall be two side yards on each lot, having a combined width of not less than 35 feet; neither of such side yards shall be less than 15 feet in width. A side yard adjacent to a side street shall not be less than 20 feet in width. 
ii.  All other nonconforming lots: There shall be two side yards on each lot, each side yard having a width of ten feet. A side yard adjacent to a side street shall be not less than 15 feet. 
3.  Minimum required rear yards. There shall be a rear yard having a depth of not less than 25 feet. 
(3)  Maximum lot coverage for nonconforming lots. The building area, exclusive of outdoor swimming pools, shall not exceed one-third of the lot area or 5,625 square feet, whichever is less. 
(4)  Maximum building height for nonconforming lots. The same as specified in section 44-159. 
(5)  Alteration or repair of nonconforming building and structures. Existing single-family dwellings and customary accessory buildings located on nonconforming lots or tracts legally created and lying within a subdivision which was in existence on March 25, 1955, may be altered, repaired or enlarged; provided however, any enlargement or alteration shall meet all setback, yard and height requirements established herein for such subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 340, § 9-2, 5-20-1980; Ord. No. 658, §§ 1-3, 2-21-2006) 
Sec. 44-218.1 - Non-conforming lots joined with land-locked lots or parcels. 
(a)  Generally . Where a lot was non-conforming on March 25, 1955, and has been joined in common ownership with a contiguous lot or parcel that, prior to such joinder, did not have any frontage on a public or private street, the combination of lots shall be treated as a single lot for the purposes of applying this chapter, except as provided below. 
(b)  Minimum yard requirements . For purpose of applying subsection 44-218(b)(2) regarding minimum yard requirements/building lines for non-conforming lots, the combined lot referenced in subsection 44-218.1(a) above shall be treated as a nonconforming lot, regardless of whether, after the combination, it meets the minimum area, width, and depth requirements for a conforming lot. 
(Ord. No. 2015-844, § 1, 5-24-2015) 
Sec. 44-219. - Nonconforming uses of land or land with minor structures only. 
    Where, at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000.00, the use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
(1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived; 
(2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived; 
(3)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which the land is located; 
(4)  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
(Ord. No. 340, § 9-3, 5-20-1980) 
Sec. 44-220. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived that could not be built under the terms hereof by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a manner which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(2)  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of such destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Should any such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(Ord. No. 340, § 9-4, 5-20-1980) 
Sec. 44-221. - Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. 
    If lawful uses involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or more, or of structure and premises in combination, which exist at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
(2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(3)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(4)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 12 months during any three-year period, the structure, or the structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(5)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purposes of this subsection is defined as damage to the extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction. 
(6)  All nonconforming uses shall be separated from contiguous residential property by any one of the following: 
a.  A brick or stone screening fence seven feet high. 
b.  A strip of dense natural foliage 35 feet in width and at least seven feet in height. 
c.  A formal hedge four feet thick and at least seven feet high.

    On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing after obtaining a building permit as herein set out, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
(Ord. No. 340, § 9-6, 5-20-1980) 
Sec. 44-223. - Uses under special exceptions provisions not nonconforming uses. 
    Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms of this chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in the district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.
