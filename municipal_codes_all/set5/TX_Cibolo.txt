PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Cibolo, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances as adopted through October 23, 2007, by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX A CDA:1 CODE APPENDIX B CDB:1 CODE APPENDIX C CDC:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

In all cases when the City Council shall order an election for the issuance of bonds of the City, it shall, at the same time, submit the question of whether or not a tax shall be levied upon the property within the City for the purpose of paying the interest on the bonds and to create a sinking fund for their redemption.

(b)  If any provision of this Code or the application thereof to any person, fact, situation or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this Code and the application of such provision to other persons, facts, situations or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

Sec. 1-14. - Violations of Code or ordinance; culpable mental state. 
(a)  In any prosecution filed under a provision of this Code or any ordinance of the city which expressly requires proof that the actor engaged in conduct intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence, then a person does not commit an offense unless he is shown to have engaged in such conduct as the definition of the offense requires. 
(b)  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city an act or a failure to act is prohibited, or is made or declared to be unlawful, or an offense, or a misdemeanor, and such provision does not expressly require proof of a culpable mental state, proof of a culpable mental state is not required for conviction of such offense, it being the intent of the city council to dispense with the requirement of any culpable mental state in prosecutions filed under such provisions of this code and other ordinances of the city; provided, however, that if such offense is punishable by a fine exceeding the amount authorized by Tex. Penal Code § 12.23, a person does not commit such offense unless he is shown to have recklessly engaged in such conduct as the definition of the offense requires. 
(c)  Proof of a higher degree of culpability than that charged constitutes proof of the culpability charged.

ARTICLE VIII. - CODE OF ETHICS AND CONDUCT 
DIVISION 1. - CODE OF ETHICS 

Sec. 2-501. - Applicability and scope. 
    This Code of Ethics shall apply to the mayor and city councilmembers, and all appointed board, committee and commission members of the City of Cibolo; who shall collectively be referred to as members in this Code. 
(Ord. No. 1149 , § I(Exh. A), 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-502. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Code is to fulfill city council's obligation under Section 14.09 of the City Charter. Moreover, city council finds that its members and the members of the city's boards, committees and commissions are composed of people with a diverse range of backgrounds, personalities, values, opinions, and goals who have volunteered their time to serve their fellow citizens in the guidance and policy-making of the City of Cibolo; and that the office held by elected and appointed officials is one of trust and service, and creates special responsibilities for the office holder. Therefore, elected and appointed members must uphold values of professional and personal ethics that exemplify the highest of standards and demonstrate objectivity, impartiality, honesty, integrity, respect, faithfulness, and transparency. 
(Ord. No. 1149 , § I(Exh. A), 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-503. - Standards of ethical conduct. 
(a)  City Charter . Members shall respect and adhere to the City of Cibolo Charter in its entirety. The Charter provides a council-manager system of local government where the city council determines the policies of the city with the advice, information and analysis provided by the public, boards, committees and commissions, and city staff. Except as provided by the Charter, members shall not interfere with the administrative functions of the city or the professional duties of city staff. Members shall also refrain from interfering with the ability of staff to implement council policy decisions. Furthermore, members shall comply with all of the Charter requirements for prohibitions (section 3.07); conflicts of interest (article III, section 3.10; article XIV, section 14.07); nepotism (article XIV, section 14.01); equality of rights (article XIV, section 14.02); wrongful influence (article XIV, section 14.03); wrongful interference (article XIV, section 14.04); political activities (article XIV, section 14.05); accepting gifts (article XIV, section 14:08); and compliance with this Code of Ethics and Conduct (article XIV, section 14.09). Specific examples of violations of the Charter that shall be avoided are as follows: 
(1)  Do not get involved with administrative functions. Members shall not attempt to unethically influence or coerce the city manager or department heads concerning either their actions or recommendations to the city council, boards, committees or commissions about personnel, purchasing, awarding contracts, selection of consultants, processing development applications, or the granting of city licenses or permits. 
(2)  Do not attend city staff meetings unless requested by staff. Even if the member does not say anything, the member's presence may imply support, show partiality, intimidate staff, and hamper the ability of staff to do their jobs objectively. 
(3)  Make no promises on behalf of city council, boards, committees, commissions or staff. Members shall not overtly or implicitly promise action on the part of the city council, a particular board, committee or commission or city staff on any matter specifically delegated by the City Charter to be handled by the city manager. For any matters not specifically delegated to the city manager by the Charter, the member should still refer the matter to the city manager and, if the member feels necessary to do so, may then bring the matter before the city council for consideration and action. When approached by the public to address or correct a situation for which the city manager is responsible for managing under the Charter or any ordinance, rule or regulation of the city, members shall refer the public to the city manager or advise the public that the member will refer the matter to the city manager. 
(b)  Additional standards of ethical conduct . 
(1)  Confidential information . Members shall respect the confidentiality of information concerning the property, personnel, or affairs of the city. They shall neither disclose confidential information without proper legal authorization, disclose information protected by attorney-client privilege, nor use such information to advance their personal interests, financial or otherwise, nor advance the interests of third parties. 
(2)  Public resources . Members shall not use public resources not available to the public in general, such as city staff time, equipment, supplies, or facilities, for private gain or personal purposes. 
(3)  Special advantage . Members shall not take any special advantage of services or opportunities for personal gain by virtue of their public office that is not available to the public in general. They shall refrain from accepting any gifts, favors, or promises of future benefits which might compromise their independence of judgment or action or give the appearance of being compromised; and, even when the acceptance of a gift would technically be permissible under section 14.08, Members shall not accept any gifts, favors, or promises of future benefits which might compromise their independence of judgment or action or give the appearance of being compromised. 
(4)  Open meetings . Members shall comply with the Texas Open Meeting Act (Tex. Government Code Chapter 551) and shall report any attempt by other members to circumvent the requirements of the Texas Open Meeting Act. Members shall not post communications or information on social media relating to city business when such posting may be viewed and commented on by a quorum of the membership in violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act. 
(5)  In accordance with the law, members shall disclose investments, interest in real property, sources of income and gifts, and any other interests in direct business transactions that involve their capacity as an official of the city and where official actions by the city council, committee, commission or board members are required. Members shall abstain from participating in deliberations and decision-making where such conflicts may exist. 
(6)  Issues that may require the involvement of outside agencies. "Outside agencies" mean state administrative agencies, boards, committees' commissions or other type of enforcement bodies and county, state or federal law enforcement agencies. If a member or city employee has reason to believe that an issue has arisen that requires the consultation with, referral to or involvement of an outside agency to assist the city with resolving the issue and that involves possible criminal activity by another member, or officer or employee of the city, the individual shall first consult with the city manager and, if the individual or city manager still finds it is necessary to do so, may bring the matter before the full city council to ascertain whether action against the member, officer or employee is appropriate. 
(7)  Oath of appointment . An appointee to a board, commission or committee shall abide by the terms of their oath of appointment.

DIVISION 3. - CODE OF CONDUCT 

Sec. 2-531. - Applicability and scope. 
    This Code of conduct shall apply to the mayor and city councilmembers, and all appointed board, committee and commission members of the City of Cibolo; who shall collectively be referred to as members in this Code. However, as city council realizes that unlike ethics, civility and good manners are difficult to mandate and enforce, this Code rather than setting out regulatory standards provides a guide as to how members should conduct themselves in both the conduct of city business and in their personal lives. 
(Ord. No. 1149 , § I(Exh. A), 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-532. - Purpose. 
    Election to the office of city council member reflects the trust the citizens of the City of Cibolo have placed in its councilmembers; and appointment to a board, committee or commission reflects equal trust that the council has placed in its appointees. The purpose of this Code is to describe the manner in which members should treat one another, city staff, constituents, and others as representatives of the City of Cibolo. And while it is understood that members shall not always agree as to adoption of policy and decisions that affect the city, members must always be mindful that citizens expect members to conduct themselves in a respect and civil manner. The subsections below, while not an exhaustive list, are set out as a guide as to manner members should conduct themselves at all times. 
(1)  Respect for each other, city staff and the citizens of Cibolo. 
a.  Honor the principles of representative government . Members shall recognize that public policy decisions, based on established values, are ultimately the responsibility of the entire city council. 
b.  Honor the role of the presiding officer in maintaining order . It is the responsibility of the mayor or the board, committee or commission chair to keep the comments of members on track during their respective meetings. Members should honor efforts by the presiding officer to focus discussion on current agenda items. If there is a disagreement about the agenda or the presiding officer's actions, those objections should be voiced politely and with reason as prescribed by the Charter. 
c.  Continuance of respectful behavior in private discussions . Members are expected to carry the same respect deemed appropriate for public discussion into private conversations, whether they be face- to-face, written communications, voicemails, emails, texts, or through social media. Members should refrain from making belligerent, personal, impertinent, slanderous, threatening, abusive, or disparaging comments in public or private conversation. 
d.  Treat all staff as professionals . The city staff is composed of professionals who have been hired to execute the policies, ordinances, and laws put into effect by the City of Cibolo, the State of Texas, and the United States of America. As such, clear, honest communication that respects the abilities, experience, and dignity of each individual is expected. 
e.  Honor the work of boards, committees and commissioners . Members shall respect the value of the independent advice of city boards, committees and commissions to the public decision-making process and shall refrain from using their position to unduly influence the deliberations or outcomes of board, committees and commission proceedings. 
f.  Maintain respect for city staff and citizens . Members shall support the maintenance of a positive and constructive workplace environment for city employees and for citizens and businesses dealing with the city. Members shall recognize their special role in dealing with city employees and in no way create the perception of inappropriate direction to staff. 
g.  Never publicly criticize an individual employee . Members should refrain from expressing concerns about the performance of a city employee in public or to the employee directly. Comments about staff performance should only be made to the city manager through private correspondence or conversations. 
h.  Practice civility and decorum in discussions and debate . Members should preserve order and decorum during meetings and should not, by conversation or other action, delay or interrupt the proceedings or refuse to obey the orders of the presiding officer of the meeting or of this Code of conduct. Members should, when addressing staff or members of the public, confine themselves to questions or issues then under discussion. Members shall not engage in personal attacks, nor impugn the motives of any speaker, and shall at all times, while in session or otherwise, conduct themselves in a manner appropriate to the dignity of their office. 
i.  Speak with one voice . Members will frequently be asked to explain an action or to give their opinion about an issue as they meet and talk with constituents in the community. It is appropriate to give a brief overview of the facts or city policies as they relate to actions taken by the city council, board, committee or commission. Objectively present the city council, board, committee or commissions' collective decision or direction, even when you may not agree. If you feel the need to express your own opinion, state it in a way that does not undermine the collective decision or direction made. 
(2)  Endeavor towards effective and efficient governance. 
a.  Strive for efficiency . Members shall be dedicated to public service by being cooperative and constructive, and by making the best and most efficient use of available resources. 
b.  Direct administrative and operational questions to city management . Questions of city staff and/or requests for additional information that would be of interest to all members should be directed to the city manager. The city manager should be copied on any request. Materials supplied to a member in response to a request will be made available to all members so that all have equal access to information. 
c.  When possible, keep communications with city staff short, to the point and at the best possible time. Every effort should be made to limit disruption to the work of city staff. Members should avoid making requests to staff who are in meetings, on the phone, or engrossed in performing their job functions. 
d.  Check with city staff on correspondence before taking action . Before sending correspondence, members should check with the city manager to see if an official city response has already been sent or is in progress. 
e.  Legal advice . Before requesting research or other action by the city attorney, members should consult with the city manager or obtain the concurrence of the city council to ascertain whether the request or action is appropriate can be accomplished more cost effectively by alternative means. Requests of the city attorney should be made through the city manager. Exceptions to this are issues related to the performance of the city manager and unique and sensitive personal, yet city business related, requests. The city attorney shall, in any case, provide any written response to the full city council and the city manager.

(3)  Expiration and renewal: 
a.  Expiration. An annual amusement redemption machine game room license issued by the city shall automatically expire on the 31st day of December following its issuance, except as otherwise stated herein. Such license shall automatically expire if the licensee thereof sells the property or the business, transfers equity to accomplish same, or otherwise disposes of such devices. An amusement redemption machine game room license is not assignable or transferable. The city shall not refund any portion of a license after the license is issued, nor shall it prorate or reduce in amount any fee due to the city. 
b.  Late penalty. Upon the expiration of a license, the licensee shall obtain a renewal if the licensee wishes to continue operating an amusement redemption machine game room. Failure to obtain the renewal within 30 days after expiration will require such person to pay an additional late fee in an amount equal to 20 percent of the fee actually due or 20 percent of the previous year's fee, whichever is greater, in order to obtain reinstatement of his license. Nothing herein authorizes the licensee to operate after the expiration of a license and before a renewal is effective. 
(4)  Sealing: The city shall have the authority to seal any coin-operated machine located in any amusement redemption machine game room for which a license fee has not been secured. A $5.00 fee will be charged for the release of any machine sealed for nonpayment of said license fee.

j.  A game room operator must be a person who is at least 18 years of age. 
k.  Total number of machines in one establishment shall be limited to 50. 
(c)  Refusal or termination of license/appeal. If the chief of police refuses to approve the issuance of a license or the renewal of a license to an applicant, or revokes a license issued to a licensee under this chapter, such action is final unless the licensee, within ten days after the receipt of written notice of the action, files with the city manager a written appeal. The city manager shall, within ten days after the appeal is filed, consider all evidence in support of or against the action appealed, and licensee may, within ten days of that decision file a written appeal with the city clerk to the city council setting forth specific grounds for the appeal. The city council shall, within 30 days, grant a hearing to consider the action. The city council has authority to sustain, reverse or modify the action appealed. The decision of the city council is final. Filing of an appeal stays the previous action of the police chief or city manager, as applicable. Failure or refusal to renew or revocation of an amusement redemption machine game room license does not affect operation of the principal business of which the amusement redemption machine game room is a part. For example, establishments licensed by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, convenience stores and restaurants may continue to operate that business but will not be allowed to operate with the amusement redemption machines. 
(d)  Disclaimer. By issuing the required license, the city is not certifying the installation or use of the amusement redemption machines applying for a license, the applicant shall acknowledge that the city is not certifying or sanctioning the installation or use of such machines. 
(e)  Limitation of regulations on existing business. Those businesses operating amusement redemption machines and game rooms permitted by the city prior to April 24, 2012, are exempt from the regulations specified in section 18-405, and subsections 18-406(b)(6) c., d., e., f., h., and k. The relocation of the business, or the closing of the business for whatever reason whether temporarily or permanently, or the loss of or failure to renew licenses or permits required by these regulations, or the violation of any regulation causing the closure and/or loss of license required, make these exemptions void. These exemptions are specific and do not include any other regulation or code that would otherwise be applicable.

State Law reference- Flood Control and Insurance Act, Tex. Water Code § 16.311 et seq.; authorizing municipalities to take all necessary and reasonable actions to comply with the requirements and criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program, Tex. Water Code § 16.315. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 30-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Tex. Water Code § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council does ordain the provisions in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 816, art. 1, § A, 10-9-2007) 
Sec. 30-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 234, art. 1, § A, 1-9-1989; Ord. No. 816, art. 1, § B, 10-9-2007) 
Sec. 30-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 234, art. 1, § B, 1-9-1989; Ord. No. 816, art. 1, § C, 10-9-2007) 
Sec. 30-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances. 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in subsections (a)-(i) of this section are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

ARTICLE III. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 30-68. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from the systems into flood waters; and, 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 234, §§ 5:02-6:02, 5-5-1977; Ord. No. 234, art. 5, § A, 1-9-1989; Ord. No. 816, art. 5, § A, 10-9-2007) 
Sec. 30-69. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 30-7, 30-44(8), or 30-70(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in section 30-45(a)(1) is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4)a. of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of section 30-45(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

Sec. 30-71. - Areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in 30-7 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 30-45, are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 234, §§ 5:02-6:02, 5-5-1977; Ord. No. 234, art. 5, § D, 1-9-1989; Ord. No. 816, art. 5, § D, 10-9-2007) 
Sec. 30-72. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in 30-7 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard education provisions of this article. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by section 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

(a)  As often as deemed necessary for the proper enforcement of the provisions of this article and the state rules, the health official shall inspect every food establishment that is located within the city. The person operating the food establishment shall, upon request of the health official, permit access and allow the inspection of all parts of the establishment. 
    Establishments will be evaluated based on degree of public health risk. The level of risk will be based on the size and scope of food processing operations and population being served. The frequency of inspections will be set through consultation with city management. Facilities with higher risk (level 3) and needing more attention will be visited on a three times per year basis. Facilities with a slightly lower risk (level 2) will be visited on a semi-annual basis. Facilities only handling a few prepackaged foods, with the lowest risk (level 1) will be visited on an annual basis. 
(b)  In case of any items of violation identified by or brought to the attention of the health official, the person in charge of this establishment will be advised of the violation. A second inspection will be made after a lapse of sufficient time, as the health official deems sufficient for correction of the violation. Any violation of the same provision on such second inspection shall call for an immediate suspension of the food establishment permits. 
(c)  In the interest of public clarification, the results from compiling the inspection report will be converted to a letter grade with the letter "A" being the highest level of food service operation. The criteria for the various certificates are: 
(1)  Grade "A" - Attain a sanitation score of 85 or above; 
(2)  Grade "B" - Attain a sanitation score between 70 and 84; 
(3)  Grade "C" - Below 70 on the sanitation inspection. 
    An inspection certificate shall be issued and copy shall be posted by the health official at some conspicuous location on the premises where it will be clearly visible to all patrons. The certificate shall not be defaced or removed by any person except the health official. Violation of this section shall be a class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $200.00 per day that the certificate is removed, moved or defaced and/or suspension of the food establishment permit for 30 days. The health official shall permit the owner to correct any noncritical infractions within no more than 24 hours unless the owner can demonstrate to the health official's reasonable satisfaction that such infraction cannot be corrected within the allotted 24 hours or less. If the health official determines that the infraction is of an immediate threat to the public health, there shall be no grace period for correction. Repeat violations may result in higher point deduction.

(b)  Any food which appears to the health official to be of a questionable nature from the standpoint of wholesomeness or possible deleterious quality may be held for further examination by attaching a "City of Cibolo Retained" tag to the item(s) foodstuffs so retained and may not be removed or disturbed without the permission of the health official. The health official shall promptly proceed by examination, laboratory or otherwise to determine the wholesomeness of such food. As soon as such wholesomeness has been determined, such food must be immediately released. If however, such food is found to be unwholesome or deleterious, the health official must promptly condemn such food and may file petition in a court of competent jurisdiction for injunction to restrain the owner from selling such condemned food and to obtain order for destruction of such unwholesomeness or deleterious food or drink.

Revocation of a permit for any cause whatsoever is still affected by the issuance of the statement that the permit has been revoked. Reapplication for permit may be made at any time and will be approved provided that full compliance of the provisions of this article is accomplished. 
(c)  Whenever a food establishment is constructed or extensively remodeled and whenever an existing structure is converted to use as a food establishment, properly prepared plans and specifications for such construction, remodeling or conversion shall be submitted to the city for review before work is begun. Extensive remodeling means that 20 percent or greater of the area of the food establishment will be remodeled. The plans and specifications shall comply with the current adopted codes and local amendments and indicate the proposed layout, equipment arrangement, mechanical plans and construction materials of work area, and the type and model of proposed fixed equipment and facilities.

Sec. 58-14. - Comprehensive sign program regulations. 
    The use of comprehensive sign program is designed for integrated commercial and industrial developments that generally have multiple uses, multiple shared points of access, or that may be a part of a large scale development, such as a shopping mall or industrial park that is identifiable by a single development name, or by a school or hospital that may have multiple buildings and/or special signage needs; to allow site or development project signage that is appropriate to the character of the development in order to adequately identify the development in a form so as to provide a good visual environment, promote traffic safety, and minimize sign clutter in a form that is appropriate to the development and consistent with the purpose and intent of these sign requirements. 
(1)  Criteria. Comprehensive sign programs shall be subject to planning and zoning commission/sign board of appeals review and approval. The planning and zoning commission/sign board of appeals shall approve/deny/or approve with conditions of any sign program application if it finds by a preponderance of the presented evidence that approval or denial conforms to the below criteria listed in section 58-14, items (3)-(7). 
(2)  Process. Applications for comprehensive sign programs shall follow all procedural requirements described in the City of Cibolo Unified Development Code (UDC) for a zoning variance in terms of notice to adjoining property owners, published notice in the newspaper, a public hearing, and the application filing fee. 
(3)  Compatibility required. The comprehensive sign program shall promote compatibility for all signs within the specific development. Architectural theme, materials, and color should be consistent with or complement the overall character of the development in which the signs are proposed to be located and the area surrounding the development in which the signs would be located. 
(4)  Size and height. Signs proposed under the comprehensive sign program shall be no larger than a maximum of 50 percent of the standards of the sign regulations unless the applicant can demonstrate a site specific consideration, or considerations, why a deviation in excess of the 50 percent standard is justified. 
(5)  Off-site signs. Developments within a shared/common approved commercial or industrial subdivision plat, may apply for off-site signage within the area described in that commercial or industrial plat. An industrial park is an example of such a development. The signs may be placed on parcels where an existing site plan has been established. In those developments that do not have an existing site plan, the comprehensive sign program process may be utilized to establish a sign program for the development, provided that the application form for the comprehensive sign program is signed by all property owners on which signs are proposed to be located. This section shall not be construed to allow the installation of a billboard type sign. 
(6)  Placement. Signs proposed under the comprehensive sign program shall be placed appropriately in areas visible and readable. Review of location is considered by traffic movement of surrounding streets, traffic volumes and access points, MSHTO and engineering standards, visibility triangles, sign orientation and topographic features. 
(7)  Integration. All signs must be integrated with the design of the building and the site development, reflecting the architecture, building materials, and landscape elements of the project. The means of integrating freestanding signs with the architecture of the building may be achieved through replication of architectural embellishments, colors, building materials, texture, and other elements found in the building design. Integration shall also include the use of sign graphics that are consistent in terms of lettering style, colors, and method of attachment as used for wall-mounted signing found on the building. 
(8)  Amendment. Applications for comprehensive sign program amendment shall follow all procedural requirements described in the City of Cibolo Unified Development Code (UDC) for a zoning variance in terms of notice to adjoining property owners, published notice in the newspaper, a public hearing, and the application filing fee. 
    The application shall be filed with the building official, accompanied by a nonrefundable sign program amendment fee as listed in the City of Cibolo Fee Ordinance (as amended), and conform to all requirements established in section 58-9 of this chapter relating to sign permit applications. A simple majority vote of the planning and zoning commission shall be required to approve a sign program amendment. 
( Ord. No. 1188, § II(Exh. A), 12-13-2016 ) 
Sec. 58-15. - Sign maintenance and nuisances. 
(a)  All signs must be maintained in a structurally safe condition and in good repair at all times. No permit shall be required for the normal maintenance of any existing sign or repainting of the sign message, provided that the area of the sign is not enlarged, the height of the sign is not increased, the location of the sign is not changed, and the content of the sign does not materially change. Alterations to the sign, or major repairs (replacement of more than 20 percent of the sign to the original condition) shall not be considered normal maintenance and will require a permit. All signs shall be kept neatly painted or otherwise maintained, including all metal parts and supports thereof that are not galvanized or of rust resistant material. The code enforcement officer shall inspect and have authority to order the painting, repair, alteration, or removal of a sign that constitutes a nuisance, a hazard to health, or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, or obsolescence. 
    Changing of the sign message is limited to changing messages without changing the sign or its components and is considered to be normal maintenance. 
(b)  The area around the sign shall be kept clean at all times by cutting vegetation around the sign and the supporting structure. 
(c)  A sign shall constitute a nuisance if it causes injury or threatens to injure the public health, peace, or comfort or is a nuisance per se under the law. The process for abatement of a sign nuisance is as follows: 
1.  The initial determination if a sign constitutes a nuisance shall be made by the code enforcement officer. A sign is considered a nuisance per se if a sign is dangerously damaged or deteriorated of if it is damaged beyond 50 percent of its replacement value. 
2.  Notice. Upon the determination that a sign constitutes a nuisance, the code enforcement officer shall provide notice of the nuisance to the responsible party by United States certified mail, return receipt requested or hand delivery. 
3.  Abatement. The responsible party shall take action to abate the nuisance within ten business days of the date of receipt of the notice. 
4.  Appeal. A responsible party may appeal the nuisance determination to the planning and zoning commission within ten business days of the date of receipt of the notice. Notice of the appeal must be in writing and delivered to the office of the city secretary by United States certified mail, return receipt requested or hand delivery. The planning and zoning commission shall hear the appeal at its first available public meeting after receipt of the notice of appeal. The city secretary shall provide the responsible party with notice of the appeal date not less than 72 hours before the meeting at which the appeal is scheduled. The planning and zoning commission shall not disturb the determination of the code enforcement officer unless, after consideration of the testimony of the responsible party, the building official, and such witnesses that have relevant information regarding the matter, it finds the decision of the building official to be in error. Each witness shall be allowed to make a concise opening statement before being question by members of the commission. The commission may confer with the city attorney before rendering a determination. The responsible party shall have ten business days from the date of an adverse determination to appeal the commission's decision to a court of competent jurisdiction, at which time, if not appealed, the commission's decision shall become final. 
5.  City action. Upon the expiration or exhaustion of a responsible party's appeal rights, the city may abate the nuisance. 
6.  Exigent circumstances. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrary, if, after consultation with the city attorney, the building official determines the nuisance to be of imminent danger to public life or safety, the building inspector may take immediate action to abate the nuisance. However, the building official shall only exercise such abatement actions under this subsection reasonably necessary to abate the imminent danger to public life or safety. 
7.  Recoupment of nuisance abatement costs. The responsible party shall be responsible to repay the city for the actual costs associated with an abatement action under law and such repayment shall become due upon receipt of the repayment invoice for the abatement costs.

Signs not reclaimed within 30 days after a responsible party receives notice of such impoundment, by United States certified mail, return receipt requested or hand delivery, may be destroyed by the city. If the responsible party cannot be located after reasonable inquiry, such sign may [be] destroyed, if not reclaimed 30 days after notice is placed in the city's official newspaper. 
9.  The city shall not be held liable for damage to said sign(s) during the removal or storage of the sign(s) by the city. 
( Ord. No. 1188, § II(Exh. A), 12-13-2016 ) 
Sec. 58-16. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  Continuation. All nonconforming signs existing prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be allowed to remain in place, provided that they otherwise comply with: Section 58-6 (general regulations), section 58-15 (sign maintenance and nuisances) and this section. 
(b)  Transferability. 
1.  Relocation. Nonconforming signs shall not be relocated or transferable transferred to another location within the City of Cibolo municipal limits or ETJ without such nonconforming signs first being brought into full compliance with all requirements of this chapter, including obtaining a properly authorized permit. 
2.  Transfer of title. Title and ownership of nonconforming sign, excluding portable changeable copy signs, may be transferred to a new owner upon the transfer of the property upon which the nonconforming sign is located to such new owner; provided the location of the nonconforming sign is not altered. In such cases, the new property owner must submit a permit application (no fee assessed) to indicate the change in ownership. 
(c)  Registration. Within 90 days after the effective date of this chapter, the responsible party shall register the nonconforming sign with the building official. There shall be no costs associated with the registration of a nonconforming sign. It shall be the burden on the responsible party to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence that a sign, not timely registered, falls under the protection of this section 58-16. 
(d)  Removal. A nonconforming sign shall be removed as a result of any of the following circumstances: 
1.  By the acts or omission of the sign owner. 
a.  Nonconforming signs shall be terminated immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events specified below: 
i.  Destruction: A sign that, having been permitted to remain in place as a nonconforming use, is required to be removed because the sign, or a substantial part of it, is blown down or otherwise destroyed, deteriorated or dismantled for any purpose, other than maintenance operations or for changing the letters, symbols, or other matter on the sign; 
ii.  Abandonment: A nonconforming sign that has been abandoned; 
iii.  Discontinuation of use: A nonconforming sign that has been discontinued for a continuous period of 90 days; or 
iv.  Public health or safety hazard: A nonconforming sign that has become obsolete or substandard under any applicable ordinance of the city to the extent that the sign becomes a hazard or danger to public health or safety. 
b.  Sign owner's responsibility. For purpose of subsection (a), immediately above, a nonconforming sign or substantial part of it is considered to have been destroyed, deteriorated or dismantled (collectively "destroyed") if the cost of repairing the sign is more than 51 percent of the cost of erecting a new sign of the type at the same location. In the event that such destruction, deterioration or dismantling has occurred it shall be the responsibility of the responsible party to supply the City of Cibolo with a quote from a reputable sign company that shows the replacement value and the cost to restore the sign to full compliance upon request by the code enforcement officer within 15 days of said request so that the code enforcement officer may determine if the non-conforming sign has been destroyed more than 51 percent of the cost of erecting a new sign of the type at the same location. In the event the nonconforming sign is determined to be destroyed beyond the aforementioned 51 percent threshold, or abandoned or discontinued or a public hazard by the code enforcement officer, it must be removed by the responsible party without compensation by the city within ten days after the date written notice of such determination is provided to the responsibility party by certified mail return receipt requested or hand deliver. In such circumstances as determined to be warranted by the city manager, after consultation with the city attorney, a nonconforming sign determined to have become a public hazard may be summarily remove with costs to be borne by the responsible party. A replacement sign must fully comply with this chapter and shall require a permit to be obtained from the city at the set fee. 
2.  By city action. The city may require the removal, relocation, or reconstruction of any nonconforming sign provided that the owner of the sign is compensated for such costs that are associated with the removal, relocation, or reconstruction as is required by Tex. Local Government Code chapter 216. In cases where the city requires the removal, relocation, or reconstruction of a nonconforming sign the mayor is authorized to appoint a municipal board, with city council approval, in order to determine the amount of compensation as prescribed in Tex. Local Government Code section 216.004. 
(d)  [Pre-existing nonconforming signs.] All nonconforming signs existing prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be allowed to remain in place, provided that they otherwise comply with: Section 58-6 (general regulations) and section 58-15 (sign maintenance and nuisances). 
(e)  [Exception to subsection (d).] Nonconforming signs existing prior to the effective date of this chapter that are of a type that are limited to a specified time period for use in this chapter must abide by those specified time periods beginning with the effective date of this chapter.

Sec. 58-17. - Variances. 
(a)  Application and fee required. Any person, business, or other organization desiring to continue to construct, reconstruct, place, install, relocate, alter, or use any sign which does not conform to the provisions of this chapter may make application to the planning and zoning commission for a variance to the provisions of this chapter. Upon submittal of a complete variance packet, the application will be reviewed at the next regularly-scheduled planning and zoning meeting. 
    The application shall be filed with the building official, accompanied by a nonrefundable variance fee as listed in the City of Cibolo Fee Ordinance (as amended), and conform to all requirements established in section 58-9 of this chapter relating to sign permit applications. 
(b)  Requests for variances after permit denial. Within ten business days after denial of a sign permit by the building official, an applicant may file a written request for a variance of the chapter 58 regulation(s) the building official identified to be in contravention with the permit application. 
(c)  Action. Unless an extension or postponement is sought by the applicant, the planning and zoning commission must consider and take action on the written request for a variance at its first available meeting. 
(d)  Standards for variances. The commission may approve a variance only if it makes affirmative findings, reflected in its minutes of the proceedings, as to all of the following: 
1.  The variance will not authorize a type of sign which is specifically prohibited by this chapter; 
2.  The variance is not contrary to the goals and objectives outlined by the City of Cibolo; 
3.  The variance is not contrary to the public interest; 
4.  Due to special conditions applying to the land, buildings, topography, vegetation, sign structures, or other unique matters on adjacent lots or within the adjacent right-of-way, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. Ordinarily, hardship that is self-induced or that is common to other similarly-classified properties will not satisfy this requirement. Financial or economic hardship alone will not ordinarily satisfy this requirement; 
5.  The spirit and purpose of the ordinance will be observed and substantial justice will be done; and 
6.  The applicant has not sought a sign variance for a specific parcel of land from the city within the past 12 months. 
(e)  Conditions of variances. The planning and zoning commission may impose such conditions or requirements in a variance as are necessary in the planning and zoning commission's judgment to achieve the fundamental purposes of this chapter. A violation of such conditions or requirements shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The sign(s) must receive final inspection approval within three months of the date the variance is approved or the variance shall lapse and become of no force or effect. 
( Ord. No. 1188, § II(Exh. A), 12-13-2016 ) 
Sec. 58-18. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Violations. Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a violation of the city Code. Each day a violation exists shall constitute a separate violation and, consequently, a separate offense. 
(b)  Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00. 
(c)  Civil remedies. The city manager may authorize the city attorney to file an action in a court with appropriate jurisdiction to seek civil remedies to require the demolition of any sign at the owner's expense which is dangerously damaged or deteriorated. The action may include a claim for civil penalties as provided by state law. Civil remedies contained herein shall be construed to be in addition to the power of the city to abate public nuisances.

(3)  Selected materials taken from the trench shall be placed alongside and on top of the pipe for a depth of 12 inches, wetted if required by the engineer and compacted thoroughly or settled by jetting with water. The remaining depth of the ditch shall then be backfilled with a uniform plastic mixture of flexible base cement and water. Each cubic yard of the mixture shall contain a minimum of one sack (94 pounds) of cement and the necessary amount of water to obtain a plastic mixture. The cement and aggregate shall be mixed in an approved mechanical mixer. Cement stabilized backfill may, as an alternate, consist of commercial transit mix concrete containing a minimum of one sack (94 pounds) of cement per cubic yard. Cement stabilized backfill shall be placed within one hour after mixing and shall be placed and rodded in such manner as to completely fill the backfill area. Before placing cement stabilized backfill, the trench shall be cleaned of any extraneous material and thoroughly wet. All surplus dirt excavated from the ditch shall be removed from the site. 
(4)  Trench backfill within the limits of alley pavement may be settled by thoroughly jetting with water; provided such jetting is done not less than six months prior to the construction of flexible base for pavement over such backfill. 
(5)  In addition to the methods of backfill described in this section, where soil conditions permit, utility lines may be installed by jacking or boring and jacking. When pipe is jacked into place without boring the top of the pipe shall be not less than four feet below subgrade. When holes are bored the top of the pipe shall be not less than three feet below subgrade. Ordinarily the pipe will be pushed into position as the boring auger drills out the ground. Pipe will be placed after the bore is completed only in cases approved by the engineer. In no case will bored holes be appreciably larger than the pipe to be installed.

ARTICLE VII. - IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM 

Sec. 78-346. - Program adoption. 
    The City of Cibolo, Texas ("city") developed this identity theft prevention program ("program") pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Red Flags Rule ("rule"), which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, 16 C.F.R. § 681.2. This program was developed for the utility department of the city ("utility") with oversight and approval of the city council. After consideration of the size and complexity of the utility's operations and account systems, and the nature and scope of the utility's activities, the city council determined that this program was appropriate for the city's utility, and therefore approved this program on July 14, 2009. 
(Ord. No. 906, exh. A, § I, 7-14-2009) 
Sec. 78-347. - Purpose and definitions. 
(a)  Establish an identity theft prevention program. To establish an identity theft prevention program designed to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or an existing covered account and to provide for continued administration of the program in compliance with Part 681 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations, implementing Sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) of 2003. 
(b)  Establishing and fulfilling requirements of the red flags rule. 
(1)  The red flags rule ("rule") defines "identity theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person" and a "red flag" ("red flag") as a pattern, practice or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft. 
(2)  Under the rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its operation. The program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to: 
a.  Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; 
b.  Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; 
c.  Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 
d.  Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft. 
(c)  Red flags rule definitions used in this program. 
    City: The City of Cibolo, Texas. 
    Covered account: Under the rule, a "covered account" is: 
(1)  Any account the utility offers or maintains primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions; and 
(2)  Any other account the utility offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the utility from identity theft. 
    Creditors: The rule defines creditors "to include finance companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies and telecommunications companies. Where nonprofit and government entities defer payment for goods or services, they, too, are to be considered creditors". 
    Identifying information is defined under the rule as "any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person", including: Name, address, telephone number, Social Security Number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, computer's internet protocol address or routing code. 
    Program: The identity theft prevention program for the city. 
    Program administrator: The city manager is the program administrator for the program. 
    Utility: The utility is the utility department for the city. 
(Ord. No. 906, exh. A, § II, 7-14-2009) 
Sec. 78-348. - Identification of red flags. 
    In order to identify relevant red flags, the utility considers the types of accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous experiences with identity theft. The utility identifies the following red flags, in each of the listed categories: 
(1)  Suspicious documents. 
a.  Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered or inauthentic; 
b.  Identification document or card on which a person's photograph or physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document; 
c.  Other document with information that is not consistent with existing customer information (such as if a person's signature on a check appears forged); and 
d.  Application for service that appears to have been altered or forged. 
(2)  Suspicious personal identifying information. 
a.  Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other information the customer provides; 
b.  Identifying information presented that is the same as information shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent; 
c.  A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law Social Security Numbers must not be required) or an applicant cannot provide information requested beyond what could commonly be found in a purse or wallet; and 
d.  A person's identifying information is not consistent with the information that is on file for the customer. 
(3)  Alerts from others. Notice to the utility from a customer, identity theft victim, fraud detection service, law enforcement or other person that it has opened or is maintaining a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft. 
(Ord. No. 906, exh. A, § III, 7-14-2009) 
Sec. 78-349. - Detecting red flags. 
(a)  New accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified above associated with the opening of a new account, utility personnel will take the following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the account: 
Require certain identifying information such as name, residential or business address, driver's license or other identification. 
(b)  Existing accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified above for an existing account, utility personnel will take the following steps to monitor transactions with an account: 
Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment purposes. 
(Ord. No. 906, exh. A, § IV, 7-14-2009) 
Sec. 78-350. - Preventing and mitigating identity theft. 
(a)  In the event utility personnel detect any identified red flags, such personnel shall take one or more of the following steps, depending on the degree of risk posed by the red flag: 
(1)  Contact the customer, sometimes through multiple methods; 
(2)  Not open a new account; 
(3)  Close an existing account; 
(4)  Notify law enforcement; or 
(5)  Determine that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances. 
(b)  In order to further prevent the likelihood of identity theft occurring with respect to utility accounts, the utility will take the following steps with respect to its internal operating procedures to protect customer identifying information: 
(1)  Ensure that its website is secure or provide clear notice that the website is not secure; 
(2)  Where and when allowed, ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and computer files containing customer information; 
(3)  Ensure that office computers are password protected; 
(4)  Change passwords on office computers on a regular basis; 
(5)  Ensure all computers are backed up properly and any backup information is secured; 
(6)  Ensure computer virus protection is up to date; and 
(7)  Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that are necessary for utility purposes. 
(Ord. No. 906, exh. A, § V, 7-14-2009) 
Sec. 78-351. - Program updates. 
    This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the utility from identity theft. At least annually, the program administrator will consider the utility's experiences with identity theft situation, and changes in identity theft methods, consult with law enforcement authorities, and consult with other city personnel. After considering these factors, the program administrator will determine whether changes to the program are warranted. If warranted, the program administrator will update the program or present the city council with his or her recommended changes and the city council will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the program. 
(Ord. No. 906, exh. A, § VI, 7-14-2009) 
Sec. 78-352. - Program administration. 
(a)  Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies with the program administrator. The program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of utility staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program. 
(b)  Staff training. Initially, all utility staff shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected. Thereafter, all utility staff shall undergo update training not less than annually. Additionally, all new utility employees shall undergo training. 
(c)  Service provider arrangements. In the event the utility engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, including, but not limited to franchise utility providers, the utility will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent and mitigate the risk of identity theft: 
(1)  Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and 
(2)  Require, by contract, that service providers review the utility's program and report any red flags to the program administrator. 
(d)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the utility's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices are to be limited to those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

The City Manager or his/her designee shall resolve any questions concerning the similarity of the reapplication. The final decision-maker may, at its option, waive the six (6) month waiting period if, after due consideration of the matter at a scheduled and posted meeting, it is determined that denial of the request was based upon erroneous or omitted information, or if substantial new information pertaining to the request is discovered. 
C.  Amendments and Revisions to Approved Application 
Unless otherwise expressly provided by this UDC, any request to amend or revise an approved development application shall be considered a new application, which must be decided in accordance with the procedures governing the original application and the standards in effect at the time such new application is filed with the City. 
D.  Amendments Required 
Whenever a subsequent development application differs substantially from a previously approved development application to which the subsequent application must conform, the applicant shall submit an amended development application for the initial development application, which shall be decided prior to the subsequent application.

PUD zoning is designed to accommodate various types of development, such as single-family residential, multiple housing development, neighborhood and community shopping centers, professional and administrative areas, industrial and business parks, and other uses or a combination or mix of uses. A PUD may be used to permit new or innovative concepts in land use and standards not permitted or accommodated by the zoning or subdivision standards in this UDC. 
4.5.4.2  Mixed Use Regional Employment Center District (MURE) 
This zoning district is reserved for areas suitable to provide a mix of very high density residential, retail, office, service, research and development, institutional and clean light industrial uses along major highway corridors. The purpose of this district is to promote economic development and retail activity, while promoting traffic circulation and safety, protecting adjacent residential neighborhoods, and promoting a positive image of the community. It is expressly intended that no low density residential dwellings will be allowed in this mixed use district and any existing dwellings will remain as legal non-conforming dwellings. Medium density residential uses shall only be considered in the form of apartment or condominium uses on upper levels of buildings where higher intensity uses are provided on the ground level. 
4.5.4.3  FM 78 Mixed Use Overlay District (FM 78) 
The "78" Overlay District (78) intends to provide a cohesive set of design and use standards for properties within its boundaries. The District recognizes the importance of the FM 78 corridor through Cibolo as a local and regional commercial center, and emphasizes traffic management, mixed commercial and residential use opportunities, and management of visual clutter through signage control, screening and buffering. Architectural design standards are part of the 78 Overlay District to promote the development of pedestrian-scale buildings and define the corridor as a cohesive district. 
4.5.4.4  Old Town Mixed Use Overlay District (OT) 
The Old Town Overlay District (OT) is intended to provide a cohesive set of design and use standards for properties within its boundaries. The OT District recognizes the historical fabric of Old Town Cibolo and seeks to preserve the character, pedestrian scale, and architecture of the area surrounding Main Street. Additionally, it seeks to provide a pedestrian-oriented environment and flexibility for harmonious residential, civic, and commercial uses, as well as context-sensitive design standards to integrate new development with the City's original core. 
4.5.4.5  Town Center Mixed Use Overlay District (TC) 
The Town Center Overlay District is intended to provide a cohesive set of design and use standards for properties within its boundaries. The TC District recognizes the current and future importance of this area adjacent to the Old Town District, the future extension of FM 1103 and Haeckerville Road, and generally the area's central location with respect to the ultimate city limits. The TC District provides additional flexibility to mix residential, commercial, and civic uses. Additionally, it seeks to provide a pedestrian-oriented building environment and manage visual clutter through signage control, screening and buffering.

The purpose of this section is to describe lot development standards for both residential and non-residential lots. This section contains standards on lot size, minimum setback requirements, and maximum building heights in order to provide for a variety of housing and land development patterns and to meet the diverse needs of the current and future residents of Cibolo, in a manner consistent with the goals and objectives set forth in the Future Land Use Plan. 
4.7.1  Density and Maximum Lot Coverage Standards 
Article 14; Lot Design Standards of this UDC, identifies the following development standards for lots in all zoning districts. 
4.7.1.1  Maximum Development Density 
Each residential Zoning District provides a maximum number of dwelling units per acre that can be placed on a tract. In many cases, the total number of units that can be placed on a site, after considering the land area needed to accommodate infrastructure and environmental factors (right-of-way, drainage, floodplains, steep slopes, impervious cover limitations, minimum lot size standards, yard setbacks, and maximum lot coverage) will be less than based simply on the maximum development density. 
4.7.1.2  Maximum Lot/Impervious Coverage 
Each development lot has a Maximum Lot/Impervious Cover, expressed as a percentage, which represents the maximum percent of impervious surface area allowed on a lot within each particular Zoning District. It is computed as the total amount of impervious surface on the lot divided by the total lot area. Impervious surfaces on a lot include buildings, driveways, garages, porches, patios, private walks, accessory buildings, and any other impervious surfaces constructed on the lot. Building coverage is measured from the faces of the walls, not the eaves of the roof. 
4.7.1.3  Lot Dimension Standards 
4.7.1.3.1  Minimum Lot Area/Maximum Lot Area 
Minimum Lot Area is the minimum amount of square footage allowed within a lot, based on its zoning district classification. Maximum Lot Area applies only to multifamily zoning districts, in order to insure against undue concentrations of multi-family developments. 
4.7.1.3.2  Minimum Lot Width 
The Minimum Lot Width is the minimum width of a lot measured parallel to and along the front property line. 
4.7.1.3.3  Setback Measurements 
Side yard setbacks are measured from the side lot line with no vertical obstructions within the setback. Front and rear yard setbacks are measured from the front and rear lot lines, respectively. 
4.7.1.3.4  Width to Depth Ratio 
The average depth of any lot shall not exceed four times the average width of the lot. This requirement shall not apply to lots platted prior to the adoption of this UDC. 
4.7.1.3.5  Exceptions 
A.  Platted subdivisions established by a duly approved plat approved by City Council prior to April 24, 2018 shall be exempt from meeting the lot width, depth, and/or square footage requirements of this UDC and shall instead be subject to the lot design requirements in effect at the time the property was platted. This exemption shall also apply to those developments that obtained the approval of a Master Plan or Land Study prior to April 24, 2018, that are being platted in accordance with the approved Master Plan. Those developments may continue to be platted using the lot design requirements in effect when the Master Plan was approved. This exemption shall not pertain to expired Master Plans. 
B.  The Front Building Setback line shall be measured from the property line to the front face of the building, Covered porch, covered terrace, or attached accessory building. Eaves and roof extensions may project into the required front yard, not to exceed two feet (2'). Ordinary projections of window sills, belt courses, chimneys, bay windows, cornices and other architectural features may project into the required front yard a depth not to exceed twelve inches (12"). 
C.  Side Yards: Every part of a required side yard shall be open and unobstructed except for accessory buildings and HVAC equipment, as permitted herein, and the ordinary projections of window sills, belt courses, chimneys, bay windows, cornices and other architectural features, which may project up to, but not to exceed, twelve inches (12") into the required side yard. Roof eave projections may not exceed twenty-four inches (24") into the required side yard. 
4.7.2  Accessory Building Lot Coverage Standards 
Article 15; Accessory Building Standards of this UDC depict the minimum lot standards by zoning district. 
4.7.3  Accessory Building Standards 
4.7.3.1  General 
An accessory building refers to a detached subordinate structure, the use of which is incidental to that of the principal building. The size, bulk, and location of accessory buildings are limited according to Article 15 of this UDC. In every case, the maximum lot/impervious coverage specified for each district under Article 14 of this UDC shall apply. 
4.7.3.2  Easements 
General Note 2 in Article 15 allows the placement of accessory structures built on skids within three (3.0) feet of a rear or side property line, provided that the building does not interfere with the use of any easement present. In the event that an easement is present, permits may not be issued for the building unless the following language is stipulated to on the building permit: 
The owner, and any future assigns, understand and acknowledge that the proposed building is located in a legally designated easement and was informed of that fact by the City. As such, the owner and any future assigns do hereby indemnify the City and entity with easement rights against any damages that may occur to this structure in the event that the structure needs to be removed by whatever means necessary to maintain the easement. This indemnification clause may only be voided by the removal of this building outside of the said easement. 
4.7.4  SPECIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
4.7.4.1  Planned Unit Development (PUD) District Regulations 
4.7.4.1.1  Purpose 
The Planned development district is designed to provide for the development of land as an integral unit for single or mixed uses in accordance with a plan that may vary from the established regulations of other zoning districts. It is the intent in such a district to insure compliance with good zoning practices while allowing certain desirable departures from the strict provisions of specific zoning classifications. 
4.7.4.1.2  Application 
An application for a planned development district shall be processed in accordance with this Chapter and Section. A pre-planning conference is required between the applicant and the planning director prior to the actual filing of the application. 
4.7.4.1.3  District Plans and Requirements 
There are two (2) types of plans that are used in the planned development process. The general purpose and use of each plan is described as follows: 
A.  Master Plan. The Master Plan is intended to serve a general land arrangement plan as the first step in the planned development process when a PUD district is created. It establishes the most general guidelines for the district by identifying land use types, thoroughfare locations, if applicable, and project boundaries and illustrates the integration of these elements into a Master Plan for the whole PUD district. The Master Plan will become an exhibit to the ordinance creating the PUD district. Where appropriate, it is acceptable for the Master Plan and PUD Ordinance to be supplemented with a detailed written narrative and any other exhibits, as necessary, to convey to the manner in which the PUD will be developed. Since each PUD is unique, the required information necessary to review each PUD will vary depending on the size and nature of the development and the particular mix of proposed uses. When written narratives and/or exhibits are utilized, the City may include such information as conditions of the PUD ordinance. 
As may be pertinent to the request, the Master Plan shall include the following minimum information: 
1.  A general statement setting forth how the proposed district will relate to the Cibolo Comprehensive Master Plan, Future Land Use Map, Future Thoroughfare Plan and Master Park Plan and the degree to which the project is consistent with those plans. 
2.  The total acreage within the proposed district. 
3.  An accurate survey of the boundaries of the district. 
4.  Proposed general land uses and the acreage for each use, including open space. For residential development, the total number of units and the number of units per acre shall be provided. 
5.  Proposed arterial or collector streets, or conceptual driveways, as appropriate. Showing local streets or private ring roads accessing the development is optional. 
6.  A statement or narrative that describes the applicable development standards that are proposed to govern the development of the proposed PUD. It is acceptable to include a general note or narrative statement reference such as "Pod 1 shall be developed in accordance with all of the development standards of a particular zoning district and that Pod 2 shall be developed in accordance with all of the development standards of another zoning district. As an alternative, the developer may propose development standards unique to the proposed PUD and reference other requirements of the UDC that shall be applicable, such as buffering, landscaping or the like. Regardless of the method that an applicant selects, the applicant shall clearly delineate each of the following regulations for the PUD: 
 Minimum lot area. 
 Minimum lot width and depth. 
 Minimum front, side, and rear setbacks. 
 Maximum height of buildings. 
 Maximum building coverage. 
 Minimum parking standards for each general land use. 
7.  As a separate exhibit supporting the Master Plan, the applicant shall provide a scaled plan and/or a detailed aerial photo of the area surrounding the proposed PUD, to be titled as Context Plan , The Context Plan shall include sufficient details depicting existing land uses, transportation networks and related contextual details of the area surrounding the proposed PUD. The Context Plan shall be reviewed with the Master Plan to determine if the Master Plan is appropriate as proposed or if development standards applicable to the proposed PUD should be incorporated into the PUD Ordinance. 
a)  The purpose of the Context Plan is to facilitate the review of the PUD application and determine if the proposed PUD will be compatible with surrounding development. Failure to properly relate the proposed PUD Master Plan to the Context Map may be used as a basis for denying a proposed PUD application. 
b)  The following elements shall be shown, or highlighted, on the Context Plan for the area surrounding the PUD, with details demonstrating how the proposed PUD will relate to these existing elements. As a minimum, the following details must be provided: 
i.  Existing streets. 
ii.  Existing 100-year floodplain, floodway, major drainage ways or linear park elements. 
iii.  City limits and E.T.J. boundaries. 
iv.  Zoning districts within and adjacent to the proposed district land use. 
v.  Utility Locations, including water, wastewater and electric. 
vi.  Existing and proposed building locations if known. 
8.  In lieu of submitting a Master Plan, an applicant may submit a combined Master Plan/Detailed Plan to be adopted with the PUD ordinance. If an applicant proposes a combined Master Plan/Detailed Plan, the plan shall both be subject to Planning and Zoning Commission review and City Council approval. A Context Plan, as described above, must also be submitted. 
9.  The City Council may impose conditions of approval, as necessary, to ensure that the PUD is compatible with surrounding uses or the goals, plans and policies of the City. 
B.  Detail Plan . The detail plan is the final step of the planned development process containing the details of development. For small PUD's, or where final development plan is known, the detail plan may be used to establish the district, and serving as the Master Plan and Detailed Plan and be the only required plan in the PUD process, provided that the Detail Plan addresses all of the requirements for a Master Plan and Context Plan, as well as those requirements described below for a Detail Plan. 
1.  Detail Plan Requirements 
The application for a Planned Unit Development Detail Plan shall include the following: 
a)  The acreage in the plan as shown by a survey certified by a registered surveyor. 
b)  Permitted uses, specified in detail, and the acreage for each use. 
c)  Adjacent or surrounding land uses, zoning, streets, drainage facilities and other existing or proposed off-site improvements, as specified by the department, sufficient to demonstrate the relationship and compatibility of the district to the surrounding properties, uses, and facilities. 
d)  The location and size of all streets, alleys, parking lots and parking spaces, loading areas or other areas to be used for vehicular traffic; the proposed access and connection to existing or proposed streets adjacent to the district; and the traffic generated by the proposed uses. 
e)  The locations, maximum height, maximum floor area and minimum setbacks for all buildings. 
f)  The numbers, location, and dimensions of the lots, the minimum setbacks, the number of dwelling units, and number of units per acre (density). 
g)  The location of all creeks, ponds, lakes, floodplains or other water retention or major drainage facilities and improvements. 
h)  The location and route of all utilities to serve the district. 
i)  The approximate location and size of buffer yards, greenbelts, common space or recreation areas, the proposed use of all areas, and whether they are to be used for public or private use. 
j)  Public sidewalks or other improved ways for pedestrian or bicycle use. 
k)  All applicable development standards, including but not limited to maximum height, lot width, lot depth, floor area, lot area, setbacks, and design elements. 
4.7.4.1.4  Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements 
Required parking shall be based on the use mix proposed for each planning development district based upon the particular merits of the development design and layout. Such standards and requirements shall comply with or be more restrictive than the standards established for the specific type uses in the particular districts in which they would ordinarily be permitted under the general UDC, except that modifications in these regulations may be granted if it shall be found that such modifications are in the public interest, are in harmony with the purposes of this ordinance and will not adversely affect nearby properties. 
4.7.4.1.5  Creation of PUD Districts 
The City Council may, after receiving the report of the Planning and Zoning Commission, approve by ordinance the creation of a PUD district based upon a Master Plan and/or a Detail Plan, as described above. The approved plan shall be made part of the ordinance establishing the district. Upon approval said change shall be indicated on the zoning maps of the city. If the PUD is approved by a Master Plan, the applicant will be required to submit Detail Plans in the future as the PUD is developed. 
4.7.4.1.6  Commission Approval of PUD Detail Plan 
The Commission is authorized to approve a Detail Plan, or the amendment to an approved Detail or Detail Plan for property for which a Master Plan has been approved by the City Council. The approved detail plan shall be permanently filed with the City Planner. The Commission may approve the detail plan if it finds that: 
 The plan complies with the PUD Master Plan approved for that property; 
 The plan provides for a compatible arrangement of buildings and land uses and would not adversely affect adjoining neighborhood or properties outside the plan; and 
 The plan provides for the adequate and safe circulation of vehicular traffic. 
If the Commission determines that the detailed plan is inconsistent with the spirit and intent of the PUD Master Plan, the Commission may deny the Detailed Development Plan. The applicant, in turn, may appeal the denial of the Detailed Development Plan to the City Council. 
4.7.4.1.7  Expiration of Approved Plans 
A.  If no detail plan has been approved for the property within 18 months of the date of approval of the original PUD Master Plan, a Detailed Plan may still be filed within one (1) year of the 18 month time period expiration, but said Detail Plan must be approved by the City Council, after receiving the report of the Commission and after notice and hearing. Above time frame is based on original PUD plan approval and does not reset if there is a PUD plan amendment/revision. 
As a condition of reinstating an expired Detail Plan, the City may require that a reinstated Detail Plan comply with any new development regulations adopted by the City after the expiration date of the Detail Plan. If no Detail Plan is submitted after this 30 month window, the PUD Detail Plan will expire and the City shall initiate a zoning case to revert the area back to its prior zoning. 
B.  An approved Detail Plan shall be valid for 24 months from the date of its approval. If a building permit has not been issued or construction begun on the detail plan within the 24 months, the detail plan shall automatically expire and no longer be valid. The Commission may, prior to expiration of the detail plan, for good cause shown, extend up to one (1) twelve (12) month extension for which the detail plan is valid. Any additional extension for up to one (1) year may be considered by City Council, but in no case shall any extension be granted for a total time period that exceeds four (4) years from original approval date of the Detail Plan. 
C.  If the Commission disapproves a detail plan over which it has final approval authority, or imposes conditions, or refuses to grant an extension of time for which there is an established detail plan, the applicant may appeal the decision to the City Council by filing a written request with the City Planner within ten (10) business days of the decision. 
D.  Changes in the detail plan shall be considered the same as changes in the UDC. Those changes which do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property and which do not alter the Uses permitted or increase the density, floor area ratio, height, or coverage of the site, or which do not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site, as indicated on the approved detail plan, may be authorized by the City Planner. An applicant may appeal the decision of the City Planner to the Planning and Zoning Commission as to whether an amendment to the PUD is required. 
E.  A Planned Development district may be approved for any use or combination of uses enumerated in those approved by the City Council. The total initial development of any Planned Development district shall not be less than 2 (two) acres, unless good cause is demonstrated to allow for the consideration of a smaller PUD. 
4.7.4.2  Mixed Use District Summary and Mixed Use Overlay Definitions 
The following sections of this Article create a Mixed Use zoning district and Mixed Use Overlay zoning districts. Below is summary table showing all Mixed Use Districts and a list of definitions that shall specifically pertain to these Mixed Uses.

ACTIVITY CENTER: "Activity center" is a general term for a Mixed Use development that integrates a range of complementary and mutually supporting uses and activities. Typically, an activity center includes a predominant type of use, such as commercial or employment-related, that is then supported by a mix of one or more other uses, such as residential, civic, or institutional. Activity centers may vary in size, intensity, scale, and their mix of supportive uses, depending on their purpose, location, and context. In each case, activity centers are intended to be mixed-use and pedestrian-oriented with good connections and transitions to surrounding areas. Residences are a component of all activity centers, whether on-site or immediately adjacent. The activity center should support a range of housing types and densities within the individual neighborhoods. There are three (3) distinct types of activity centers: 
BUILD-TO LINE: Unlike a setback line, a build-to line is the line at which construction of a building façade must occur on a lot. A build-to line runs parallel to, and is measured from, the front property line and is established to create an even (or more or less even) building façade line on a street. 
COMMERCIAL CENTER: Commercial centers are activity centers that primarily accommodate large retail establishments, which may provide major durable goods shopping, and serve a number of residential areas over a significant portion of the city. Commercial centers contain a mix of supporting uses, including multi-family dwellings, office, entertainment and retail uses, medical offices and clinics, and civic uses. The mix enables combined trip destinations and supports more effective transit service, and provides viable pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation. The FM 78 Overlay district is an example of a Commercial Center. 
CONCEPT PLAN, MIXED USE: A narrative and graphic representation drawn to scale of the proposed development of a particular site which delineates the basic zoning and subdivision requirements including, but not limited to, the intended lot lines, general uses, ranges of square footages of the proposed uses and the general location of building and parking areas, points of access, primary internal circulation, contour lines, easements and required dedication areas for public facilities. The Concept Plan will also provide the graphic details required on a preliminary plat for those instances when it will be used as a substitute for a preliminary plat. The Concept plan shall not be used as a preliminary plat when the property is located in a Planned Unit Development (PUD) zone, in a Mixed Use Zone District. 
CONTEXTUAL AREA: A mapped part of the City that is characterized by a general similarity of development age, street types and patterns, and block sizes. There are two (2) contextual areas in the City: (1) The "older/established" contextual area, known as Old Town Cibolo and (2) the "newer/developing" contextual area. 
ENHANCED DRIVE AISLE: An element of a parking area in a Mixed Use zone district intended to provide access to parking areas, and connections for vehicles and pedestrians. It serves to define a block structure in parking areas. 
FACADE: That portion of any exterior elevation on the building extending from grade to top of the parapet wall or eaves and the entire width of the building elevation. 
FOCAL POINT: A visual landmark. It commonly identifies the center of a development or area for public gathering, and contributes to establishing the character of the development. The Focal Point may be a statue, a plaza, a pavilion or some other structure or focused area. 
HUMAN-SCALE: The relationship between the dimensions of the human body and the proportion of the spaces that people use. This is underscored by surface texture, activity patterns, colors, materials and details. The understanding of walking distances and spatial perceptions at a human scale determines the most positive placement of buildings, and the physical layout of the community. Buildings ranging in height from two (2) to six (6) stories, trees and pedestrian-scaled signs and street lights, textured pedestrian paths and semi-private spaces all enhance this positive scale. 
INFILL or INFILL DEVELOPMENT: Development of vacant parcels within a built-up area. Parks and open space are considered infill development, since they are permanent uses for vacant parcels. 
INTERNAL STREET OR INTERNAL STREET SYSTEM: The system of public or private streets located internal to a development site, and which may connect at one or both ends to a perimeter public street. The internal street system is intended to provide vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle access and circulation to all uses within a development site. 
LANDSCAPE BUFFER and SCREENING TRANSITIONS: The use of landscaping, berms, fences, walls, or any combination of these, to buffer and screen a more intense land use from an adjacent, less intense use. 
LIVE/WORK UNIT: A residential use type that combines a dwelling and a commercial space under single ownership in a structure. The residential portion of the unit shall contain at least four hundred (400) square feet of gross floor area. The commercial space shall allow activities compatible with residential use with respect to noise, smoke, vibration, smell, electrical interference, and fire hazard, and may include such uses as professional services and offices, and the creation, display and sale of art, craftwork, jewelry, fabrication of cloth goods and similar activities. 
MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT: Development that combines and integrates two or more principal land uses, such as commercial, office, civic, industrial, or residential uses with a strong pedestrian orientation. The mix of uses may be combined in a vertical Mixed Use building(s) or combined in separate buildings located on one property and/or under unified control. 
MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICT. Any or all of the following zone districts: MURE district and the Old Town Overlay, Town Center Overlay and FM 78 Overlay zoning districts. 
NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER: Neighborhood centers are small, low-impact, limited activity centers intended to primarily service the needs of immediately adjacent neighborhoods, in a service area typically ranging from one half (1/2) to two (2) miles. Principal uses contribute to the efficient functioning and attractiveness of neighborhoods, relate to and accommodate walkup pedestrian traffic, and do not generate noxious fumes, excessive light or noise. The mix of uses may include neighborhood-serving retail, convenience or specialty food sales, restaurants, dwelling units above the first floor, live/work units, single-family attached dwellings, general offices, or medical offices. The Old Town and Town Center Overlay districts are examples of a Neighborhood Center. 
PAD SITE: A "pad site" is a building or building site located in a retail center that is physically separate from the principal building located within the same center. Pad sites are reserved for free-standing, single commercial uses, and accommodate buildings that are smaller than the principal building in the center. Typical pad site uses include buildings that contain restaurants, banks, and automotive services. 
PEDESTRIAN PASSTHROUGH: A feature providing unrestricted public pedestrian access through a building or structure or between buildings or structures. 
PERIMETER STREET OR PERIMETER STREET SYSTEM: The system of public streets that abut the perimeter of a development site, zone district, or activity center. Perimeter streets provide access to the internal street system, thus providing access and circulation to principal uses located in the interior of the development site, district, or activity center. 
PHASING PLAN: A graphic and narrative document that displays the sequence and/or timing of intended development. Phasing is used to sequence the provision of public facilities. Phasing may be specified in a sequential order (1, 2, 3,) or by time period (2004, 2005). 
REGIONAL/EMPLOYMENT CENTER: A regional/employment center is a large (thirty (30) or more acres), intensive activity center that combines the uses of commercial centers and employment centers and that serves the city and region as a whole. A regional activity center may be a regional shopping mall, corporate office headquarters, or a major concentration of employment supported by a mix of uses that meets the needs of employees, visitors and residents. Primary uses include major commercial and/or employment uses, supported by a full range and mix of uses including large and small retail establishments, general offices and office complexes, governmental and civic uses, business services, research and development, major service uses, restaurants, lodging, child care, personal services, and higher density housing, as well as warehousing and industrial uses or educational facilities. These centers are generally located at the intersection of or along major arterials, or in close proximity to limited access freeways and Interstates 10 and 35. The Mixed Use Regional Employment Center (MURE) district is an example of this mixed use district. 
SITE AND BUILDING TRANSITIONS: Designing and adapting the form and mass of a building to take into consideration neighboring buildings and land uses. 
TRANSITIONS: Generally, an array of tools and techniques designed to achieve compatibility between adjoining land uses that may differ by type and intensity. 
TRANSITION USES: A land use that may be appropriate to be located between land uses of different types and intensities within a mixed use project or in the context of surrounding land uses. 
VERTICAL MIXED-USE BUILDING: A multi-story building containing a vertical mix of two or more principal uses. 
WALKWAY OR PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY: An on-site path for pedestrians and/or bicyclists that is not part of the public right-of-way and is not a public (dedicated) sidewalk or public (dedicated) trail. "Walkways" as defined herein are private sidewalks that typically combine to form a network providing internal pedestrian and bicyclist access and circulation on a development site, and typically connect to the public sidewalk system. 
WRAPPED USE: A retail service or other commercial use type that occupies the ground floor of a structure and extends on both sides of a corner of a structure. 
4.7.4.3  Mixed Use Regional Employment Center (MURE) District Regulations 
A.  PURPOSE 
This zoning district is reserved for areas suitable to provide a mix of very high density residential, retail, office, service, research and development, institutional and clean light industrial uses along major highway corridors. The purpose of this district is to promote economic development and retail activity, while promoting traffic circulation and safety, protecting adjacent residential neighborhoods, and promoting a positive image of the community. It is expressly intended that no low density residential dwellings will be allowed in this district and that any existing dwellings will remain as legal non-conforming dwellings. Medium density residential uses shall only be considered in the form of apartments or condominiums on upper stories of buildings where higher intensity uses are provided on the ground level. 
This district is intended to accommodate development of regional/employment centers. The district is for large, intensive activity centers that combine the uses of commercial centers and employment centers and serve the city and region as a whole. The district should be utilized for significant and mutually supportive combinations of commercial and employment activities. Because of their size, both sets of activities function as regional centers in terms of market for retail and employment opportunities. Higher density residential use is also a critical component of a regional/employment center in order to assure extended hours of activity within the district and provide support for a mix of uses. Uses should include a mix of commercial and employment uses integrated in a single, mutually supportive regional destination. These uses may range from regional mall anchor stores, government offices, and corporate headquarters to specialty retail and higher density housing. They may also include research and development uses, major service and office center complexes, and major educational facilities, as well as warehousing and industrial uses that will not diminish the suitability of the district for less intensive uses. Supporting uses may include restaurants, hotels, entertainment, childcare, civic activities, business services, lodging for business travelers, and multifamily residential uses. Uses should be concentrated and mixed to create more diversity and synergy among uses, combine destinations, support more effective transit service, and provide viable pedestrian and bicycle access and circulation. Mobility choices should be integrated by providing pedestrian and bicycle connectivity within the center and to adjoining areas. 
B.  LOCATION 
A MURE zoning district should typically be located at the intersection of two major highways or arterial streets, along the city's planned arterial system, or in close proximity to limited access freeways and interstate highways. Concentrated employment activities should be located within MURE zone districts whenever possible. Sites with direct access to existing or planned major transportation facilities and compatibility with adjacent land uses are appropriate for the MURE zone district. 
C.  INCENTIVES 
Regulatory incentives are provided in the MURE zoning districts to encourage and facilitate creative MURE development. Following is a summary, but not an all-inclusive, description of incentives provided herein: 
1.  Broader application of staff authority to grant administrative relief from specified development and design standards to development in the MURE zoning district provided that such relief is consistent with the guidelines of this district and the Mixed Use Concept Plan of the MURE approved by the City Council. 
2.  Alternative Compliance: An applicant may propose alternative compliance to the strict application of design standards, such that the alternative: 
a.  Achieves the intent of the subject design standard to the same or better degree than the subject standard; 
b.  Achieves the mixed-use goals and policies in the Comprehensive Master plan to the same or better degree than the subject standard; and 
c.  Results in equivalent or better benefits to the community than compliance with the subject design standard.

4.  Mixed Use Concept Plan Amendments 
An Amended Mixed Use Concept Plan application shall be submitted when: 
i.  There is a proposed change in the general location of an approved principal use, or 
ii.  There is a proposed change in the amount, type or density of residential uses, or 
iii.  There is a proposed change in pedestrian or vehicular circulation systems, right-of-ways, utility corridors or easements, or 
iv.  There is a proposed change of use that would change the location or amount of required parking, or 
v.  There is a proposed change in uses that would change trip generation calculations, or 
vi.  There is a proposed change to an existing phasing plan. 
An Amended Mixed Use Concept Plan shall include maps of the entire mixed use project and shall update all development information in written and graphic format since the adoption of the original MURE Concept Plan and/or the most recent amendment(s). 
If the proposed amendment is minor in nature and generally consistent with the spirit and intent of the original Mixed Use Concept Plan, the City Planner may approve the amended plan administratively. If the amendment is more substantive in scope or in the spirit and intent of the original approved Mixed Use Concept Plan, the amended plan must be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by City Council. 
5.  Expiration of a Mixed Use Concept Plan 
A Mixed Use Concept Plan shall expire under any of the following circumstances: 
i.  Six (6) years have occurred since approval of the Mixed Use Concept Plan and no development plan implementing the Mixed Use Concept Plan has been approved; or 
ii.  Six (6) years have occurred since approval of a development plan implementing the Mixed Use Concept Plan and no building permit has been issued or any development commenced. 
6.  Extension of a Mixed Use Concept Plan 
A one (1) year extension may be issued by the Planning and Engineering Director or his/her designee, provided that a written request has been received prior to the expiration of the Mixed Use Concept Plan and the Director has determined that no major changes in the City's development standards, or changes in the development pattern of the surrounding properties has occurred. If a change occurs to the use of any surrounding property that affects a Mixed Use Concept Plan that has expired, or that is about to expire, an extension of time may only be granted after Planning and Zoning Commission review and City Council approval, with the extension being subject to any conditions of approve that address the changes to the surrounding properties that may have occurred. 
7.  Phasing Plan 
An application to establish a Mixed Use district shall include a phasing plan that describes and illustrates, in written and graphic format, implementation of the Mixed Use Concept Plan when development is anticipated to occur in multiple phases over a number of years. A phasing plan shall be a working document used to identify the sequence, timing and responsibility for construction of necessary utilities and infrastructure. The requirement for a phasing plan is waived if a complete development plan for the entire zone district is submitted. The phasing plan shall show how the project is to be incrementally and sequentially developed. It shall show the phasing of principal uses, transition tools, pedestrian improvements, streets, utilities, drainage improvements, building areas, parking, and interim uses. It shall relate the development phases to infrastructure requirements for each phase. 
8.  Site Plan 
Before building permits may be issued in a Mixed Use district, a site plan that implements the approved Mixed Use Concept Plan must be approved. Changes in ownership shall not be considered a valid basis or justification for a variance or an amendment to any previously approved site plan. All development in a Mixed Use district shall be in conformance with the approved site plan. 
9.  Site Plan Review Criteria 
In addition to the Site Plan review criteria for all development plans in the City as set forth in the UDC, and compliance with all applicable sections of the UDC, including but not limited to the building design, environmental performance standards, landscaping and tree preservation and all platting requirements. The following additional review criteria shall apply: 
i.  The proposed development plan will implement the Mixed Use Concept Plan and all mixed use requirements. 
ii.  The proposed development plan will implement the mixed use phasing plan. 
iii.  The proposed development plan will demonstrate how all mixed use district purposes, requirements and standards as set forth below will be met. 
10.  Procedures and Criteria for Alternative Compliance 
Alternative compliance is a procedure that allows development to propose alternative design concepts that will fully implement the spirit and intent of any design standard for mixed use development through an alternative design. It is not a general waiver of regulations, but is rather a site-specific plan to incorporate an alternative design that is equal to, or better than, the strict application of a design standard in meeting the intent of both the particular mixed use zone district and the applicable standard. 
If a mixed use concept plan or site plan is to include a request for approval of alternative compliance, a pre-submittal conference is required to determine the preliminary response from the City Planner. Based on that response, the application for a concept plan or site plan shall include sufficient explanation and justification, in both written and graphic form, for the alternative compliance requested. A request for approval of alternative compliance may include proposed alternatives to one or more design standards. 
To grant an alternative compliance request, the City Planner must find that the following criteria are met: 
i.  The proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject design standard to the same or better degree than the subject standard. 
ii.  The proposed alternative achieves the mixed-use goals and policies in the Comprehensive Master Plan to the same or better degree than the subject standard. 
iii.  The proposed alternative results in benefits to the community that are equivalent to, or better than, compliance with the subject design standard. 
If the City Planner determines that all three criteria are not met, an applicant may appeal that determination to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
Alternative compliance shall apply to the specific site for which it is requested and does not establish a precedent for assured approval of any other request at any other location in the City. 
E.  USE REGULATIONS 
In the "MURE" Mixed Use Regional Employment district, no buildings or land shall be used and no buildings shall be hereafter erected, reconstructed, altered, or enlarged, unless otherwise provided in these regulations, as described below: 
1.  PERMITTED USES 
a.  Uses permitted by right in the MF-1, MF-2, C-1, and C-3 Districts shall be permitted, except as may be expressly prohibited below. Institutional uses such as technical schools, hospitals and utilities are also permitted by right. 
2.  PERMITTED USES SUBJECT TO SUPPLEMENTAL USE REQUIREMENTS 
a.  Heavy commercial uses in the C-4 district and clean light industrial uses and research and development uses, as are permitted in the I-1 district shall also be permitted subject to adherence to the Environmental Performance Standards of the UDC and Performance standards described in this district. For terms of enforcing these regulations, clean light industrial shall be defined as an industrial use that has little to no environmental impact related to noise, heat, vibration, odor, and the other environmental performance standards described in this UDC, with aspects of industrial processes being contained within an industrial building and/or structure. Semi-truck docks and related loading, storage and distribution functions of permitted clean light industrial uses would be focused toward site locations that are not visible to surrounding rights-of-way and that are hidden by principal buildings or other screening techniques. Any outdoor operations or outdoor storage shall be completely screened and buffered from public rights-of-way and any adjoining residential zoning districts and be placed on a surface that will not create dust or non-compliance with any Environmental Performance Standard of this UDC. 
3.  CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT (CUP) REQUIRED 
a)  Any use permitted in the I-1 and I-2 district that may fall outside the definition of clean light industrial may be considered subject to the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) by the City Council, after Planning and Zoning Commission review and recommendation. The criteria for the approval of any CUP for an I-2 will be the suitability of such a use in the context of the surrounding uses and the ability of the I-2 use to contain all industrial processes to the interior of buildings and not pose a significant risk to any residential uses that may be in the MURE development. Any outdoor storage or other outdoor uses shall be completely screened and buffered from public rights-of-way and any adjoining residential zoning districts and shall be limited to an incidental percentage of the total operations. Any prospective I-2 use shall demonstrate the measures proposed to be implemented to comply with all Environmental Performance Standards of this UDC, including, but not limited to the prevention of dust. The City reserves the right to deny any CUP request for an I-1 or I-2 for a non-clean light industrial use on the basis that such requested use would be detrimental to overall development of the highway corridor or adversely affect any adjoining or nearby properties. 
4.  PROHIBITED USES 
a)  The following uses are expressly prohibited: sexually oriented businesses, mini-warehouse storage, general outdoor storage, auto impound yards, kennels, pawn shops, surplus sales, or outdoor advertising signs (billboards) or any other use that is not consistent with creating a positive image for the City. Any use that is not expressly listed as a prohibited use that is denied by staff may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council in accordance procedural requirements of this UDC and the Fee Schedule for Administrative Appeals. 
F.  HEIGHT, AREA and GENERAL BUILDING PLACEMENT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
In the "MURE" Mixed Use Regional Employment district, the following development standards shall be applicable: 
1.  Floor Space : No limit on floor space for shops, stores, or businesses except as specified herein. 
2.  Height : No building hereafter erected, reconstructed, altered, or enlarged shall exceed sixty-five (65) feet. Building height is limited to two and one-half (2 1/2) stories, or thirty-five feet (35') when they are located within one hundred feet (100') of a property zoned Single-Family (SF-1 through SF-6). 
3.  Front Yard : There shall be a front yard of not less than twenty-five (25) feet for uses permitted in the MF-1, MF-2, C-1, and C-3 districts and fifty feet (50') for uses permitted in the C-4, I-1 and I-2 district. Corner lots shall have a minimum exterior side yard of twenty-five feet (25') on the second front yard, the yard generally parallel to the street with the greatest frontage, unless reversed frontage is approved by the City Planner. Frontage on third streets shall be considered as second front yards and shall be subject to the primary front yard setback requirement. 
4.  Rear Yard : There shall be no rear yard setback imposed, except on those lots that border AG or any SF zoning districts. In those instances, the rear yard setback shall be twenty-five (25) feet for MF-1, MF-2, C-1, or C-3 uses, thirty-five (35) feet for C-4 uses and fifty (50) feet for industrial uses. As a condition of CUP approval, the City may require a greater setback for any I-2 uses, as appropriate. 
5.  Side Yard : There shall be no side yard setback, except on lots that border AG or any SF zoning districts, in which case side yard setback shall be twenty-five feet (25') for MF-1, MF-2, C-1, and C-3 district uses, thirty-five (35') feet for C-4 uses and fifty (50') feet for industrial uses. As a condition of CUP approval, the City may require a greater setback for any uses, as appropriate. 
6.  Zero Lot Line Setback Permitted : The City Planner may consider zero lot line development where appropriate on those side and rear property lines within the interior of the Highway Commercial zoning district where same uses adjoin one another, subject to compliance with all applicable City Building and Fire Codes, as amended. The allowance for zero lot line setbacks does not supersede any requirements for landscaping, or buffering required by this UDC or any applicable City Building or Fire Codes. The zero lot line setback option shall not apply to uses allowed by right in C-4, I-1 and I-2 districts except uses in those districts that adjoin uses in the same C-4, I-1 or I-2 districts. If the City Planner denies a request for a zero lot line setback, the developer may appeal this decision to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
7.  Width of Lot : The minimum lot width standards listed in Article 14 of this UDC shall be applicable. 
8.  Driveways : Drive approaches shall comply with all driveway standards of the UDC and the TIA approved as an element of the Mixed Use Concept Plan and/or the site plan.

10.  Signs : Outdoor advertising signs (billboards) shall be prohibited. On-site signs shall be permitted in accordance with the City Sign Ordinance, as amended. In those instances where a development has multiple street frontages, or have multiple uses, the developer shall have the right to submit a Master Sign Program to govern the entire development. Approval of the Master Sign Program shall be subject to Planning and Zoning Commission approval Sign Programs are designed to allow an appropriate mix of signage necessary for way-finding, identification of the name of the overall development project and for major anchor tenants. Master Sign Programs shall create a unifying sign design for the entire development. If the Commission denies a request for a Master Sign Program, the developer may appeal this decision to the City Council. 
11.  Minimum Size of MURE District : The minimum size of acreage that may be considered for MURE zoning shall be 25 acres. The City Council has the discretion to approve smaller size tracts for MURE zoning if an applicant can demonstrate by the submittal of a Mixed Use Concept Plan how the provisions of the MURE district on a smaller scale project would benefit the City or would assist the City. The City may also assign MURE zoning to smaller sized properties in order to achieve the goal of assembling properties for the purpose of creating a conventionally sized MURE district. 
G.  BLOCKS, ACCESS AND STREET DESIGN STANDARDS 
The single most important element in the physical and functional integration of mixed use development is vehicular and pedestrian transportation networks and orientation. The overall layout of a mixed use project is built around a viable transportation network that provides for superior movement of automobile and truck traffic and includes pedestrian-friendly improvements to generate a high level of pedestrian activity and connectivity between different land uses. The framework for a pedestrian-oriented layout has three main components: 1) a block structure that reflects a walkable arrangement and positioning of uses, 2) building placement, orientation, and design to enhance the pedestrian environment and streetscape within that structure, and 3) a street network to define the block edges, create continuous pedestrian connections, and integrate pedestrian travel with other modes of transportation. 
1.  Block Design 
The following block design guidelines are intended to provide for enhanced automobile and truck access efficiencies and create pedestrian-oriented development by establishing a well-defined pattern of walkable blocks and intersecting streets, attractive and well-designed streetscapes that are human-scaled and pedestrian friendly. Buildings must relate appropriately to surrounding mixed uses and create a heightened sense of place, by providing safe, efficient and convenient vehicular access and circulation patterns, in concert with pedestrian-friendly development designs. 
a)  Block Standards 
i.  Block standards shall apply to all developments contains four (4) acres or more of gross land area. 
ii.  All development shall be arranged in patterns of interconnecting streets and blocks, while maintaining respect for the natural landscape and floodplain. 
iii.  Each block shall range between a minimum of 200 feet and a maximum of 600 feet. 
iv.  The average block length standard across each development site and the entire MURE district shall be a maximum of five hundred (500) feet, except for those uses where the scale of operations require additional block length. 
v.  For block lengths that exceed 400 feet, a mid-block pedestrian pass through shall be provided, where practical, connecting opposite sides of block faces. For large scale industrial operations, this requirement may be waived if this requirement is not practical. 
vi.  An applicant may submit alternative block standards, provided that such alternative achieves the intent of the above standards and the procedures and criteria of this section. 
vii.  An enhanced drive aisle should be used to frame block frontages that consist entirely of surface parking areas. 
viii.  For blocks that contain non-residential uses, midblock through-alleys are encouraged to enable secondary vehicle access. 
ix.  A block is defined as a tract of land bounded by streets, or a combination of streets, driveways, open space, or easements right-of-way, shorelines of waterways, or boundary lines of municipalities. Blocks shall generally adhere to the design standards depicted in Diagram 1 below, subject to permitted design deviations created by needs of specific large scale uses or developments that result in private streets and/or internal access drives. 
Mixed Use Diagram 1 Street Design and Pedestrian
Connection Concepts

b)  Vehicle Access, Circulation, and Connectivity Standards 
i.  Vehicle access, circulation, and connectivity in all Mixed Use districts shall be subject to the approval of a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) prepared in accordance AASSHTO standards and generally accepted traffic engineering standards. 
ii.  Streets and access shall be provided in accordance with the Future Thoroughfare Plan, all transportation requirements of the UDC and the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
iii.  Streets and access shall be provided in a manner that relates appropriately to existing roads, perimeter streets and driveways. 
iv.  Within any mixed use district, cross access easements and/or common shared driveways shall be required to ensure access between uses and to reduce traffic congestion on public streets. 
v.  Where the entire frontage along an internal block face consists of parking areas, an enhanced drive aisle may be utilized in lieu of a street to provide access to the parking area provided that the TIA demonstrates that the throat length is sufficient to provide adequate stacking space and driving lanes into and out of the enhanced drive aisle to allow safe ingress and egress and minimize traffic congestion. 
vi.  Development in Mixed Use districts shall be based on a block structure that is consistent with the block standards contained herein, in accordance with the UDC and in a manner compatible with existing streets and blocks. 
vii.  Internal streets in Mixed Use districts shall be aligned to connect with existing or proposed external streets of equivalent functional classification in order to create through street connections from mixed use development to adjacent development. When necessary to prevent cut-through traffic from entering adjoining residential areas, street alignments shall be discontinuous and traffic calming improvements shall be utilized. 
viii.  For new Mixed Use developments that are four (4) acres or more in total gross land area, internal circulation shall be provided through an internal street system and multiple blocks. 
ix.  Internal streets provided according to this section may be public or private. All public and private streets shall be designed and constructed according to the policies, standards, and guidelines governing street design of this section, the UDC and the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
H.  PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE ACCESS, CIRCULATION and CONNECTIONS 
1.  Pedestrian friendly design is integral to efficient circulation in a mixed use development. Mixed use center visitors and residents should be encouraged to walk via a carefully designed, safe and enjoyable network of sidewalks and walkways. Easy, reasonably direct access should be provided to buildings, amenities, parking, and bike paths. There should be frequent, well placed connections to adjacent land uses to encourage neighbors to use alternative means of transportation to visit the center. Pedestrian crosswalks should be designed so that pedestrians are as safe as possible. Development of appropriately designed crosswalks is encouraged for the safety and convenience of pedestrian street-crossings. The goal is to place at least as much emphasis on alternative modes of transportation as on auto access. 
2.  These standards are intended to ensure a safe and convenient system of well-connected pedestrian ways and bikeways. These facilities shall be designed to link MURE developments with adjacent uses, including residential areas, shopping, employment centers, recreational facilities, open space, parks, transit stops, and schools. Within individual developments, safe and convenient pedestrian and bikeway systems shall be provided that directly connect buildings, parking areas, open space, transit stops, services, on-site amenities, and other areas of interest. 
3.  Mixed Use developments shall provide and contribute to an on-site system of pedestrian walkways, sidewalks, and bikeways to provide continuous access to all uses within a development site and to land uses on adjacent properties, per the UDC and Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
4.  Connectivity Standards 
All new development shall provide pedestrian and bicycle systems that provide continuous connections with off-site destinations according to the following standards: 
a)  Safe and convenient bicycle and pedestrian access from the development site shall be provided to existing and designated public bike paths or greenways located on or adjacent to the development site. 
b)  Connections shall be made to provide direct pedestrian and bicycle travel from within the development to adjacent uses and perimeter sidewalks. 
c)  Where a Mixed Use district is located adjacent to a signalized street intersection, a pedestrian walkway shall connect the on-site pedestrian system with the intersection. 
d)  Connections from a perimeter public sidewalk system to the on-site sidewalks shall be made at the same block length interval as exists within the development site to the greatest extent practical. 
e)  Within all Mixed Use districts, each development shall provide an on-site system of pedestrian walkways or public sidewalks throughout the Mixed Use district. On-site pedestrian circulation systems shall provide the most efficient access route between the intended points of travel. Specifically, on-site pedestrian connections shall be provided to and between the following points: 
f)  The primary entrance or entrances to each building containing a principal use; 
g)  Greenways or trail systems; and 
h)  On-site amenities. 
i)  Pedestrian networks must be provided that provide linkages to primary Mixed Use development destinations to prevent short cuts through landscape areas or unnecessary driving. Consequently, sidewalks should be planned early in the site design process and should be broadly depicted on the Mixed Use Concept Plan. 
j)  All developments served by on-site parking in surface lots or parking structures shall provide either a sidewalk along the perimeter of the block or a designated pedestrian walkways through the parking lot, extending from the rows of parking furthest from the building served to either a building entrance or to a sidewalk or walkway leading to such entrance. 
k)  Where an internal block face exists or is proposed greater than four hundred feet (400'), a pedestrian walkway shall be included through the parking lot, separate from streets, such that the four hundred foot (400') minimum distance between walkways is achieved. Alternative compliance may be allowed as described in this section. 
l)  Where an enhanced drive aisle forms the perimeter of a block, sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of the drive aisle. 
I.  PARKING 
The purpose of this section is to ensure the provision, location, and design of off-street parking areas that accommodate motor vehicles while balancing the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users with the use of the automobile. Parking areas are secondary and supportive of the primary land uses on the site. 
1.  Generally, the parking requirements of the UDC shall be applicable to all Mixed Use districts. The City, however, recognized that the unique nature of mixed use development poses challenges to providing adequate number of parking for mixed use projects or a wasteful surplus of parking spaces and impervious cover. This is particularly an issue in mixed developments that combine residential and non-residential uses that have unique parking needs, such as hotels, restaurants, medical uses and high density residential. Consequently, the City will allow the submittal of a Parking Demand Analysis developed specifically to quantify the off-street parking requirements for a specific land use or mix of land uses. Such a parking analysis shall be prepared by qualified professionals and shall be subject to City approval through the Mixed Use Concept Plan process, without the need for variances from the parking standards of the UDC. 
2.  Exemption for Off-Street Parking in Structures 
Required off-street parking spaces provided within a parking structure (either above or below-grade) shall be exempt from the maximum off-street parking amount established above. 
3.  Shared Parking Standards 
The amount of off-street parking required for a Mixed Use development may be reduced by an amount determined by the City Planner when it can be demonstrated through a parking demand study that sufficient parking is or can be met by the subject uses through shared parking. The parking demand study shall provide information and evidence about the anticipated parking demand at peak times during a day and the distance relationship between available shared parking spaces and the specific uses served. 
4.  Shared Parking Encouraged 
To promote an overall reduction in parking, the use of shared parking shall be required when the development is under the control of a single owner/developer and contains commercial, retail, office, institutional, or other uses with staggered peak parking demands. 
5.  Shared Parking and Cross Access Agreements 
Where shared parking is provided, a shared parking and cross access agreement between the cooperating property owners shall be approved by the City Planner and recorded prior to issuance of a building permit. This agreement must be recorded as a deed restriction on both properties and cannot be modified or revoked without the consent of the City Planner. If any requirements for shared parking are violated, the affected property owners must provide a remedy satisfactory to the City Planner or provide the full amount of required parking for each use, in accordance with the requirements of the UDC. 
6.  Maximum Total Reductions 
Total cumulative reductions to the minimum off-street parking requirements shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of spaces required by the UDC, unless an additional reduction in spaces is quantified in a parking demand study approved by the City Planning and Engineering Director or his/her designee. 
Figure IV.41 - Typical off-street parking 
7.  Parking Location and Layout 
The purpose of these standards is to ensure that the location and design of off-street parking areas balance the needs of pedestrians and automobiles on the site. The location and layout of parking areas should support the pedestrian environment as well as contribute to efficient automobile access and circulation. 
8.  On-site, Off-Street Surface Parking Standards and Building Orientation 
Off-street surface parking provided on-site for development within a Mixed Use district shall be located according to the following standards: 
a)  Off-street parking shall be context sensitive. In Mixed Use districts where buildings are located close to public rights-of-way, parking shall be provided on the rear side of the building. 
b)  Off-street, surface parking areas shall be located at the side, to the rear, or at the face of a building that does not front along a street. No off-street parking shall be located between a building and the adjacent street frontage unless the parking field is buffered from the right-of-way view by berms, landscaping or decorative monumentation. 
c)  All off-street surface parking areas shall be located within a designated block. For block faces that are composed entirely of surface parking lot areas, a street or enhanced drive aisle (Figure IV.44) that provides a detached sidewalk, defined pedestrian crossings, and street or parking lot trees along the block face shall border the block face. 
d)  Rear sides of buildings with associated parking fields that back up to public rights-of-way shall be permitted subject to back of the building having a decorative design and limited service areas, such as truck docks, to ensure an attractive streetscape. 
e)  Off-street surface parking areas that serve buildings fronting on an entry/spine street should be located to provide the earliest possible access to automobiles after they have entered the site. 
f)  The use of alternative pervious parking surface materials, such as geo-block, may be utilized. 
9.  Parking Structures Standards 
a)  Off-street parking facilities in above-grade structures shall comply with the following standards: 
i.  Blank walls are prohibited. Parking structures shall be visually similar in character and scale to adjacent buildings. 
ii.  Except on sides abutting an alley, all floors above the ground floor of the parking structure shall have architecturally articulated facades designed to screen the view of parked cars. 
b)  Vehicle entries/access to off-street parking structures shall be integrated into the placement and design of adjacent buildings or oriented away from the primary street frontage. At a minimum, parking structure facilities shall have user vehicle access from locations that minimize conflicts with pedestrian circulation. 
c)  Ground Floor Use and Design - Nonresidential Parking Structures 
When a parking structure provides commercial parking or is integrated into a building containing primarily nonresidential uses, at least eighty percent (80%) of the ground floor of any side of an above-grade parking structure that is adjacent to a public street (except an alley) or adjacent to a public open space/plaza shall be constructed to an adequate depth to permit future occupancy by any commercial or other non-parking principal use allowed in the district. The ground-level facade of the structure for at least the lowest twelve (12) vertical feet (1 st story) of the structure and shall include at least three (3) of the following features designed to create an attractive ground level garage design appropriate for the MURE: 
Facade articulation and modulation through changes in vertical wall plane and/or a change in building material; 
 Use of real windows with glazing that may be translucent, but shall not include black or mirrored glass or similar opaque glazing; 
 Integration of multiple building entrances. 
 Use of false windows defined by frames or lintels and sills; 
 Buffering of the street edge with landscaping, berms, or landscaped planters. 
d)  Ground Floor Use and Design - Residential Parking Structures 
When a parking structure provides parking for residential uses in the area, or when the structure is integrated into a residential building, the applicant shall either: 
i.  Follow the design standard for Nonresidential Parking Structures described above; or 
ii.  Integrate non-residential uses into the ground level of the parking structure 
iii.  Use a combination of non-residential uses the ground-level façade of the structure elements described above for at least the lowest twelve (12) vertical feet (1 st story) of the structure and shall include at least three (3) of the listed design elements to create an attractive ground level design of land uses and design elements appropriate for the MURE: 
 Use of real windows with glazing that may be translucent, but shall not include black or mirrored glass or similar opaque glazing; 
 Integration of multiple building entrances. 
 Use of false windows defined by frames or lintels and sills; 
 Buffering 
e)  Incentive for Parking Structures 
Subject to approval by the City Planner, if off-street parking is provided in a structure (above or below grade) that is integrated into the design of a building containing a principal use, the maximum building height may be increased by up to 25% of the height limitation of the Mixed Use district. 
J.  LANDSCAPING and SCREENING 
1.  In addition to on-site amenities, landscaping in mixed use developments is applied primarily in three settings: parking lots, streetscapes and walkways, and at the edges of a site. In all three cases, a thematic approach to landscape design can enhance the pedestrian environment, unify the different elements of the project, and impart a well-defined character and image. Landscaping shall be provided in accordance with all landscaping, screening and buffer requirements of the UDC, with an emphasis placed on the appearance of the site from rights-of-way and from any adjoining residential uses within, or outside, of the Mixed Use development. 
2.  Required parking lot screening requirements shall apply to both perimeter and internal streets. Surface parking spaces shall be screened from right-of-way views to a minimum height of forty-two (42) inches above street elevation by the use of berms, plantings, and/or decorative structures. 
3.  Use of Screening Structures In Lieu of Plantings 
The use of structures such as masonry walls or ornamental fencing for street-side parking lot screening purposes shall be permitted in lieu of plantings. Structures shall be a minimum of forty-two inches (42") in height from street elevation. 
4.  In order to encourage infill and redevelopment in Mixed Use districts on constrained sites containing less than ten (10) acres and bordered by developed land along the entire perimeter (excluding intervening public streets), the following exceptions to the parking lot landscaping requirements above are available to such infill and redevelopment occurring in an Older/Established Contextual Area: 
 The City Planner may reduce the 20% landscaping requirement up to fifty percent (50%) of landscaping requirements provided that trees planted along the site perimeter also serve to screen and shade the interior of the parking lot and fully buffer any protected use. 
5.  Tree Preservation as Administrative Relief: The preservation of valuable protected or heritage trees may serve as a credit in lieu of required shade trees as provided in the UDC 
6.  All screening and buffering requirements of the UDC shall be fully applicable. Outdoor storage, where permitted, shall be fully screened and shall only be permitted on a dust free surface material. 
7.  Required street trees in mixed use zone districts may be located in the public right-of-way at locations that will not damage sidewalks, curbs, street or utility improvements. Street trees shall be planted along all streets in a Mixed Use district. 
K.  USE CONTEXT AND USE TRANSITIONS 
One essential element to provide for the long term success and viability of Mixed Use districts in the City is the provision of transitional uses and use context between different land uses. This is essential to ensure public safety, maintain livability for residential uses within Mixed Use districts and ensure the long term viability of the Mixed Use district. Transitional context sensitive measures are also essential to ensure that a Mixed Use district will not adversely affect the viability of existing or proposed uses outside of, but adjoining, a Mixed Use district. Appropriate transition measure between variable land uses within and outside of the Mixed Use development must be developed at the conceptual stage of developing a Mixed Use Concept Plan. For that reason, all Mixed Use Concept Plan must clearly designate the techniques that are proposed to provide appropriate transitions and to ensure that the Mixed Use development is contextually sensitive to existing development outside of the Mixed Use development. 
1.  Transitions can be provided by the developer by using any of the following techniques, or by a combination of techniques: 
 Space (Distance) 
 Earthen Landscaped Berms 
 Landscaping (Dense Evergreen Shrubs and a Mix of Trees in Layers) 
 Decorative Fences/Walls 
 Decorative Building Designs, Quiet Building Sides, Limiting Upper Story Windows 
 Road (Tree Line Boulevard or Parkway Design) 
 Green Belt/Tree Preserve, Common Amenity Area or a Wet or Dry Stormwater Pond or Linear Park 
 Reduced Building Height/Building Bulk Step-downs 
 Land Use Transitions from Higher to Lower Use Intensities 
 Implement Green/LEED Design Concepts 
 Building Layout and Screening Techniques that confine or internalize impacts of more intensive uses on less intensives uses 
 Innovative Spatial Land Use Planning Techniques such as creating common areas or pedestrian ways between various intensities of land uses 
 Any other alternative measure(s) that will provide a suitable transition and ensure safety and compatibility between uses 
 Limit Uses to those businesses that generally operate between 8 am to 5 p.m., disallowing uses with outdoor operations and other activities in certain use areas or limiting any other operational aspect(s) of development. 
Transitions between adjacent land uses with different intensities are typically achieved through back-to-back building orientation, attractive building design, large distances between uses and landscaped buffer areas per 4.7.4.3(10). Accordingly, the following standards and guidelines encourage the use of alternative transition tools, including site/building transitions (such as reducing the scale of commercial building mass next to residential), and development of less intense land uses between commercial and single-family residential areas (such as lower-intensity office, civic/open space, or multi-family land uses). Limited operational compatibility standards are offered as a tool to further ease transitions from more intense to less intense land uses. Landscaped buffers, walls, and fences are used only when these other alternative transitions are not effective or not possible, given site conditions and constraints, or not desirable given prevailing development patterns in a specific area. 
2.  Transitional Standards 
a)  Development of a more intensive land use adjacent to an existing, planned or zoned less-intensive land use, either inside or outside the Mixed Use district boundary. The City Planner shall have the authority to make a final determination regarding relative intensity of adjacent land uses, taking into consideration, at a minimum, the relative size, design, operations and traffic generation patterns of the adjacent land uses; and 
b)  Require mitigation techniques to mitigate negative impacts, uses or activities on a project that, as determined by the City Planner, could reasonably be regarded as a nuisance for neighbors. 
c)  Transitional determinations made the City Planner may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
3.  General Transition Tool Guidelines 
a)  When a transition tool is required, an applicant shall incorporate site and building transition tools, green/open space transition tools, and transition uses before using landscape buffers or screens. 
b)  The following are approaches, methods and techniques that are permitted transition tools under this part: 
 Site and building transition tools, including but not limited to, building setbacks as established by surrounding development, building placement and orientation as established by surrounding development, similar building height, similar building width, similar roof form, similar building materials, and facade articulation. 
 Green/open space transition tools, including but not limited to the use of courts, squares, parks and plazas, and use of natural features such as topography, waterways, and existing stands of trees. 
 Transition uses and other community serving uses as transitions, such as, but not limited to the transition uses and siting lesser intensive uses at the perimeter of the Mixed Use district. 
 Parkways, streets and streetscapes; 
 Operational standards, and 
 Landscape buffers and screens. 
c)  Mixed use development should employ the following techniques as applicable to ensure compatibility with surrounding development. For purposes of these transition tools, the term "surrounding development" shall mean (1) immediately adjacent development on the same block face or on facing blocks as the subject site, as well as (2) prevalent patterns established in the existing neighborhood located within one-quarter mile of the subject development site. 
d)  Use similar building setbacks, as established by surrounding development; 
e)  Use similar building placement and orientation, as prevalent in surrounding development; 
f)  Use similar building height as exists for immediately adjacent development (e.g., step down the building height of the more intensive land use to approximately match the building height of an adjacent, less intensive land use); 
g)  Use similar building width, as prevalent in surrounding development; 
h)  Use similar roof form and building materials, as found on immediately adjacent development; 
i)  Mitigate the larger mass of commercial, civic, and industrial buildings with façade articulation; 
j)  Use front-to-front nonresidential to residential building orientations, especially with commercial uses that are pedestrian intensive (e.g., restaurants, banks); 
k)  Orient land uses with potentially adverse impacts, features, or uses away from neighboring uses. For example, avoid placing garages, parking lots, or service areas facing the fronts of neighboring buildings. 
4.  Green/Open Space Transitions: Mixed use development may employ the following techniques to provide transitions and ensure compatibility with surrounding development: 
 Use small green spaces, courts, squares, parks, plazas, and similar spaces as transition areas that can also function as community gathering places. 
 Use existing natural features as transitions, including natural differences in topography (not retaining walls), streams, existing stands of trees, and similar features. When existing natural features are used as transitions, the City may still require that adequate pedestrian connections to adjacent land uses be accommodated. 
5.  Transition Uses and Other Community-Serving Uses as Transitions. 
 An applicant may site a transition use, as specified on the Mixed Use Concept Plan, or any other similar use, as transitions to lower intensity adjacent uses, such as residential. 
 For example, when office, small-scale retail, pedestrian-intensive retail, civic, or public uses are planned as part of the same development containing more intensive commercial uses, the applicant may site the less intensive uses or more community-serving uses as transitions to lower intensity, adjacent uses, such as residential. Banks, and restaurants-all of which are community-serving uses-may be sited next to, and/or fronting, adjacent medium-density residential uses. 
6.  Parkways, Streets, and Streetscapes: The distance and separation afforded by the public right-of-way, together with similar or the same type of streetscape improvements on both sides of parkway or street may be utilized as a transition to adjacent development. 
7.  Landscape Buffers and Screening Transitions. Where application of the transitions tools listed above are not possible, or where the City Planner determines these transition tools by themselves do not create an adequate transition to or buffer for less intensive land uses, the landscape buffer and screening requirements of the UDC may be utilized. 
8.  Operational Compatibility Standard 
The City Planner may impose conditions that impose operational compatibility standards, or accept formally recorded Deeds, Restrictions and Covenants that regulate discretionary development actions of end users to ensure that development in a Mixed Use zone district will be compatible with existing and planned neighborhoods and uses, including but not limited to conditions regarding the following: 
 The availability or ability to develop specific uses otherwise allowed by the UDC; 
 Hours of operation; 
 Hours of deliveries and other similar uses; 
 Location, intensity and hours of operation of exterior lighting, including security lighting; 
 Placement of trash receptacles; 
 Amplification of music in a place of entertainment; 
 Location of delivery and loading zones; and 
 Placement and illumination of outdoor vending machines. 
9.  Transitions along the Public Right-of-Way 
a.  Within a mixed use zone district or other commercial center or mixed use development, vehicle drivers on the adjacent public rights-of-way should be able to recognize the increased presence of pedestrians and bicyclists, who in turn should perceive the improved accommodation of alternate-mode travel and increased personal safety in these places. 
b.  Incorporate medians and islands into streets for pedestrian refuge; 
c.  Enhance mid-block and intersection crosswalks with respect to paving treatments, signal activation, curb cuts, and similar elements; and 
d.  Integrate a sidewalk and pedestrian walkway system into the development's on-site circulation patterns. Emphasis should be placed on connections between front doors, parking, and transit. 
L.  SIGNAGE 
Signage in a mixed use center is important not only for effectively guiding vehicular and pedestrian circulation, but also for establishing a project identity. Locational, directional, and tenant signage provide necessary orientation for users. It is also important for marketing the various uses and creating a positive image of the development. Signage that is designed according to a theme consistent with the overall design of the development serves to unify the center. 
1.  The signage in a mixed use center is to be coordinated to provide a unified signage design. Signage is to be planned to clearly identify different use areas, complement the pedestrian nature of the center and shall be integrated to complement the architectural consistency with the overall design of the building that the sign identifies or of the center. The unified sign design elements should identify a recognizable character for sign design that contributes to the character of the center. Signs should reflect the character through consistency of materials, illumination, sizes, proportions and locations. 
2.  Signs should be carefully integrated within the site, landscape and architectural design context within which they are located. Size, shape and proportions should be compatible with the size and scale of the surroundings and should not compete with or obscure other design features of the site, landscape or structures. Signage should also provide attractive and appropriately placed designation of primary entrances. 
3.  In the vicinity of residential uses, lighting should be reduced or extinguished during nonbusiness hours or at a certain hour in the evening, to reduce adverse impacts of commercial lighting on residential use. Internally illuminated signs or awnings are generally discouraged. 
M.  ROADWAYS/TRANSPORTATION 
Mixed use centers will incorporate all modes of transportation (motorized vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians) both safely and efficiently by meeting the design standards outlined in the UDC and Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
Since mixed use developments tend to create higher traffic impacts than those that are strictly residential, mixed use centers will be limited to locations along arterial and collector streets, with the cross-street for an arterial being no less than a collector. This will minimize the impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
1.  Access and Connectivity 
Access and connectivity for all modes of transportation is key to developing viable mixed use centers. Access to mixed use centers needs to be safe for both vehicles and pedestrians. Mixed use centers must also maintain good connectivity and safe pedestrian crossings while not overburdening the regional transportation system with traffic signals. The following access standards are to be met for a mixed use development: 
a)  A minimum of one access point per property ownership shall be permitted, which may be jointly shared with adjacent properties. 
b)  Signalized access will only be allowed where approved by the City Engineer based on the recommendations of an approved TIA and in accordance with all AASHTO standards and only when traffic impacts are forecast to meet signal warrants as identified in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Pedestrian signals will be allowed when traffic and/or pedestrian impacts are forecast by the Traffic Study to meet signal warrants as defined in the MUTCD. The installation of traffic and pedestrian signals for proposed development will not be the responsibility of the City. 
c)  To determine the placement of a signalized access when warrants are met, a progression analysis shall be conducted within a traffic study for existing plus site generated traffic and for twenty-year horizon conditions in order to meet City standards for traffic flow along an arterial or collector street corridor. 
d)  Signalized access will only be allowed for streets constructed to City standards. 
e)  Mixed use developments will be based on a block structure to provide connectivity and to allow block length combinations that will provide flexibility in providing pedestrian access and signalized access when warranted. Block lengths, as measured from curb face to curb face, will be a minimum of two hundred (200) feet and a maximum of six hundred (600) feet, with the average of all block lengths in a mixed-use development not to exceed five hundred (500) feet. No vehicular access will be allowed into mixed use centers within six hundred (600) feet of two intersecting principal arterials or higher classified roadways. Pedestrian and/or bicycle access into the site will be required within two hundred (200) feet of two intersecting principal arterials. 
f)  Left- or right-turn storage lanes may be required along arterials or parkways and along entry/spine streets that provide access to a mixed use center. The specific design of such lanes shall be based on twenty-year traffic projections for that roadway and meet the guidelines outlined in the Cibolo UDC and Design and Construction Manual. 
g)  Driveways that provide access to parking lots from perimeter streets into mixed use centers shall be of sufficient length to allow vehicles to enter the center and not be obstructed from on-site conflicts in which traffic queues onto the public or private street system. The greater the peak hour traffic demand for the mixed use center, the longer the unobstructed driveway must be. The unobstructed length shall be measured from the back of the sidewalk or the stop bar exiting the site to the first intersection back of curb or parking drive aisle. The minimum driveway lengths are as follows: 
h)  Pedestrian access shall consist of sidewalks and an on-site system of pedestrian walkways as identified in both the pedestrian assessment portion of the Traffic Study and in the pedestrian circulation plan submitted as part of the Mixed Use Concept Plan. Sidewalks and on-site walkways shall provide direct, continuous access between the intended points of travel. Specifically, pedestrian connections shall be provided to and between the following points: 
 From parking to the primary entrance or entrances to each building housing a principal use, 
 Any sidewalk or walkway on adjacent properties that extends to the boundaries shared with the development, 
 Any public sidewalk system along the perimeter streets adjacent to the development site, and 
 Any public amenities. 
i)  All sidewalks, pedestrian walkways, or trails shall have and maintain a minimum unobstructed pathway width of six (6) feet and be detached from the back of curb, unless otherwise referenced. 
2.  Pedestrian Environment 
Following are the pedestrian standards to be maintained for a mixed-use development: 
a.  A pedestrian assessment study will be conducted as part of the traffic study for a mixed use center. In addition to the other information required as part of the traffic study, the pedestrian assessment shall provide information on estimated hourly pedestrian and vehicular traffic for the mixed use development. 
b.  Entry/spine streets shall be required for all mixed use developments. Entry/spine streets are intended to provide the main access from arterial streets into the center and are intended to identify that a motorist has entered a "unique" area. Entry/spine streets are also intended to concentrate and provide a safe route for pedestrian and bicycle ingress and egress into and out of the mixed use development. 
a.  Clear sight distances free from obstructions must be maintained to allow vehicles to safely make turns at intersections and for pedestrians to have adequate time to cross the street. Therefore the UDC Site Distance Requirements will be applied to proposed projects. Intersection design shall meet MUTCD guidelines and may include enhanced crosswalks with directional ramps, pavement treatment, median refuge islands and pedestrian indicators. 
b.  Pedestrian refuge areas or medians will be required on all roadways classified as major collector and above. 
c.  All pedestrian crossings shall comply with the standards set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), UDC, or Cibolo Design and Construction Manual, whichever is the stricter rule. Pedestrian ramps shall be oriented directionally only. 
d.  Delineated crosswalks with patterned surface can be effective traffic control devices; however, they should not be used indiscriminately. It has been shown that pedestrians may develop a false sense of security regarding their use of a marked location and step into the crossing without adequately checking for oncoming vehicles. Information from the pedestrian assessment will be evaluated based on AASHTO standards and generally accepted transportation engineering standards. 
N.  UTILITIES 
The design of a mixed use development is to occur in a comprehensive manner, where land uses, site layout, utility corridors, landscaping, lighting and other infrastructure are designed in concert with one another. This will especially apply to utility design work, where advance planning and layout will facilitate construction, operation and maintenance, both from a functional and aesthetic standpoint. 
When submitting the Mixed Use Concept Plan the following information shall be provided: 
 A plan identifying the points of interconnection for water, wastewater, gas, and electric. 
 A map showing the general corridor and initial layout for each utility. 
 Demand calculations for each utility under full build-out conditions. 
 A summary describing current utility infrastructure in the area of development. This summary shall include the age and condition of the infrastructure, and any proposed modifications (including relocation and replacement). Capacity issues and load requirement of the proposed mixed use shall also be identified, including any impacts on existing infrastructure. 
1.  Supply and General Standards 
a)  Each utility will determine if existing mains and service lines are adequate to serve the proposed uses. Modification of existing utility lines used to support the new development, if required, shall be at the developer's expense. 
b)  Fire service and hydrant lines installed for commercial or multi-family residential use require independent connections to the water mains. 
c)  Where available, recycled or reclaimed water should be used for landscape irrigation. The City encourages the creation and/or extension of recycled or reclaimed water mains and the use of recycled or reclaimed water for irrigation. 
d)  Consideration for wastewater hydraulics should be included in the Mixed Use Concept Plan. Modifications of existing infrastructure to achieve the required flow rate should be at the developer's expense. 
e)  Private main agreements may be required for parcels with limited access to public facilities. 
f)  Access to utility infrastructure is of prime importance and shall be maintained to City standards for all public streets and utility easements. 
g)  The initial Mixed Use Concept Plan should show all proposed rights-of-way and utility corridors and easements. 
h)  Easements shall be provided for all public water lines and hydrants not located in a public right-of-way. Changes in location of utilities or final transformer, fire hydrant or meter locations may require granting of additional easements. 
2.  Street Lighting 
a.  Street lighting systems, when provided, should be located in the utility corridor of the parkway area of the ROW. To the extent possible, public streetlights should be limited to public roadways and utility easements in private roadways. 
b.  Public street lighting should be installed and maintained by GVEC (and CPS where applicable). All other lighting for onsite streets, pedestrian walkways, bikeways and parking lots should be installed and maintained by the developer. The spacing, location, height, fixture style, light source and level of illumination shall be subject to the standards and review of GVEC or CPS. Other types of light poles or luminaires/fixtures may be installed, subject to the approval of GVEC or CPS. 
3.  Landscaping 
a.  Fences and substantially sized landscaping shall be prohibited in utility easements. Flowers, grass and groundcovers shall be required to cover all easements. Small shrubs may be planted at the developers risk in the event that the easement needs to be maintained. No trees shall be placed within 15 feet of the centerline of any wet utility. 
b.  Cibolo main and service lines that run under decorative rock, landscaping, or specialty paving may be required to be sleeved or encased to protect the integrity of the main and service lines and minimize damage to landscaping in the event of required maintenance. 
4.  Cable and Telecom 
Cable &telecommunications facilities may be included in a joint dry trench, subject to the agreement of each utility. 
5.  Stormwater Ponds and Drainage Easements 
The Mixed Use Concept Plan should show stormwater ponds and easements necessary to comply with the UDC and City Design and Development Manual. 
O.  COMBINING MURE DESIGN ELEMENTS INTO A MIXED USE CONCEPT PLAN 
This section shows a potential layout for a mixed use development to demonstrate how the various provisions, standards, and guidelines in this section can be applied in concert to a mixed use development. Given the potential range of site sizes, conditions, locations, contexts, uses, intensities, building types, and transitions, there is no limit to the possible variations in layouts of mixed sites in Mixed Use districts. The purpose of this hypothetical design is to take just one possibility as an illustrative example for applying specific code sections, design standards, and guidelines within the context of a unified site plan for a mixed use development. 
The illustrations are in the order of an idealized planning and design process: 
1.  Identify the Mixed Use site and place its size and location into the context of existing uses, access, and connections. 
2.  Develop the proposed mixed use development in terms of land use mix, acreage, square footage and parking; with particular emphasis on: 
 Block Structure and Street Network 
 Building Placement and Parking 
 Context and Transitions to existing development 
3.  Develop a Mixed Use Concept Plan to show use locations, streets, storm ponds and other major project elements. 
4.  Refine the Mixed Use Concept Plan into a detailed site development plan.

4.7.4.4  Old Town Mixed Use Overlay District Regulations 
The Old Town Mixed Use Overlay District (OT) is intended to provide performance standards that direct the redevelopment of properties within the district. The focus of the performance standards is to limit specific impacts to adjacent properties, while enabling flexibility in planning to the developing owner. Transition of use, buffering, and internal circulation are emphasized. Where these standards conflict with other standards or regulations of this or other City Ordinances, or with private restrictive covenants, the more restrictive standard shall apply. 
4.7.4.4.1  Permitted Uses 
The uses of the underlying zoning district from the official City zoning map, as amended, are permitted, to the extent that all applicable performance standards of this section are met. In addition to the permitted uses of the underlying district, the following uses are permitted within the OT district boundary: 
 Single-family residential, provided that this use takes access from a local public street. 
 Attached residential uses (Upper-story or behind primary structure) are permitted, provided that the residential use is clearly secondary to the primary commercial (C-2) use, the attached residential is not visible from right-of-way and the gross floor area of the entire structure does not include more than 50 percent residential uses. 
 Institutional uses such as, but not limited to parks, government offices, churches, schools, technical schools, hospitals shall be permitted. 
 Townhouse residential, condominium residential and duplex residential to 12 units per acre development density is permitted subject to the granting of a Conditional Use Permit, per the CUP requirements of Article 3 and 4.3.2 of this UDC. 
 Hotel/Motel (Bed and Breakfast) are permitted subject to the granting of a CUP. 
4.7.4.4.2  Performance Standards 
Any use permitted within the base district of the Old Town Overlay District, or as permitted above, shall conform to the following performance standards: 
A.  Lighting and Glare 
No use or operation shall be located or conducted so as to produce intense glare or direct illumination across the bounding property line from a visible source of illumination nor shall any such light be of such intensity as to create a nuisance or detract from the use and enjoyment of adjacent property. 
B.  Open Storage 
No open storage of materials or commodities, or equipment shall be permitted except as an accessory use to a main use which is located in a building. No open storage operation or refuse disposal containers shall be located in the front of the main building and no storage use shall constitute a wrecking, junk, or salvage yard. All open storage areas and refuse disposal containers shall be screened from view of the public by a fence or wall (minimum height 6 feet, maximum height 8 feet), and shrubs, trees or other landscaping as approved by the Building Official; and no allowed open storage shall extend above the specified screening fence or wall. A Dust Control Plan, demonstrating compliance with the Environmental Performance Standards of this UDC, shall be required for any outdoor storage areas. 
C.  Parking 
Off-street parking shall meet the standards of the UDC. However, shared parking may be utilized within the Old Town Overlay district provided a Shared Parking Study is prepared and submitted with the Site Plan Application that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. Old Town parking standards may be further relaxed in the event that a public parking facility is located within 500 feet of the proposed use. 
In addition to the above, any development proposed within the Old Town Overlay District may be offered a possible percentage reduction to off-street parking requirements where no shared parking exists. Percentage reduction may be offered per City Manager or his/her designee subject to a Pre Development meeting with staff and exhausting any shared parking alternatives. 
D.  Internal Circulation and Connectivity 
The site plan shall provide for a logical system of internal circulation which minimizes access to adjacent arterial streets. Street, driveway and alley connectivity shall be provided to all adjacent non-residential properties, regardless if the existing adjacent tracts offer a receiving connection point. Pedestrian connectivity (i.e. sidewalks) shall be provided to adjacent tracts, regardless if the existing adjacent tracts provide a connection point. 
E.  Setbacks 
Front yard setbacks may be reduced to the average front yard setback of existing buildings on the same side of the street block. Building separation must be maintained pursuant to the Fire Code. 
F.  Maximum Lot Coverage 
The maximum allowable impervious cover may be increased by way of a waiver request to 95%, provided that stormwater management facilities are available to mitigate increased peak runoff, or adequate conveyance is provided consistent with adopted drainage criteria. This waiver may be granted at the discretion of the City Manager, upon consultation with the City Engineer. 
G.  Buffering 
A buffer yard is required where a non-residential use is adjacent to any residential use. The buffer yard must consist of one of the following options: 
1.  A 10-foot wide planting with an average of two evergreen trees for each 50 linear feet of buffer yard, spaced no more than 30 feet apart to provide additional screening above the wall. In addition, this option requires a solid six-foot screening wall constructed of brick, stone, reinforced concrete or other similar two-sided masonry materials; or 
2.  A 30-foot wide planting with a berm at least three feet tall and eight feet wide, with an average of two deciduous shrubs and two evergreen shrubs at the top of the berm per 50 linear feet. 
H.  Building Design 
Buildings in the Old Town, shall be governed by the following standards: 
1.  Modifications to the exterior façade(s) of any existing building shall first be approved by the City subject to a finding that the proposed design, fenestration, (windows), height, color palette and exterior building materials are consistent with surrounding buildings and general design themes of the Old Town. 
2.  All new buildings in the Old Town shall incorporate a design, height, fenestration (windows), color palette and exterior building materials that are cohesive with those on surrounding buildings and are consistent with the general design theme of the Old Town. 
3.  Building design shall preserve or enhance the historical fabric, character, pedestrian scale and architecture of Old Town Cibolo and shall be context-sensitive. 
4.  Residential development shall be consistent with the scale, height, exterior building materials, design, colors, roof pitches, setbacks and related characteristics of surrounding residences and consistent with the general Old Town style.

ARTICLE 9. - OUTDOOR DISPLAY AND STORAGE 

Section 9.1 - General 
Any merchandise, material or equipment situated outdoors in the zoning districts described in this Article are subject to the requirements of this Article. For the purpose of this Article, outdoor storage and display are classified into three categories, as enumerated below in Section 9.3. 
Where practical, outdoor storage shall be designed to minimize the installation of impervious surfaces that result in greater stormwater volumes and higher, erosive velocities by allowing parking lots, service roads, and other suitable areas normally covered with concrete and asphalt, such as outdoor storage areas, to utilize porous pavement, pavers, and other "green" design solutions provided that such alternatives designs are properly designed with highly durable materials in accordance with accepted engineering standards. 
It is preference of the City that all outdoor storage be located on hard surfaces that do not generate dust. The City recognizes that there are uses that do not lend themselves to such a standard. When an owner proposes storage on pervious cover or fill, the City reserves the right to require the owner to submit for review and approval a dust control plan, per UDC Article 7.2.4(6), for any open outdoor storage use that may generate dust, with respect to the material being stored or the proposed surface material. The City may require the implementation of dust remediation measures to mitigate dust control issues. 
Section 9.2 - Allowed Outdoor Display and Storage 
Three categories of storage shall be allowed in the Zoning Districts as designated by a "P" or "P-S" in the table provided below. A "P" indicates a permitted use outright, while a "P-S" designation indicates a permitted use subject to meeting all supplemental requirements of the use per UDC Article 6.

and Utility Lines Public Roads 0 1.5 1.1 1.5  
I)  Small wind energy systems must meet all setbacks for principal structures for the zoning district in which the system is located. 
II)  Guy wires used to support the tower are exempt from the small wind energy system setback requirements. 
b)  Height . For lots in the SF-1, SF-2, SF-3, SF-4, SF-5, SF-6, TF-1, MH-1, MH-2, C-1, C-2 and Old Town zoning districts, small scale wind generation systems shall be limited free-standing and/or roof mounted vertical axis helix wind turbines with a height that shall not exceed 35'. In the event that structures or vegetation on an adjoining property result in practical difficulties in deploying such a system, the Board of Adjustment can consider a variance to allow additional height and consider the off-site impediment to wind flow as a valid hardship for the granting of a variance to a height that will clear the wind generation system from the impediment. 
For lots in the PF, MF-1, MF-2, C-3 districts, small scale wind generation systems shall be limited free-standing and/or roof mounted vertical axis helix wind turbines with a height that shall not exceed 50'. This requirement shall also to schools, churches and government facilities, regardless of the zoning of the site. The height limitation can be increase by ten feet (10.0') for the installation of these systems on light standards and like equipment. In the event that structures or vegetation on an adjoining property result in practical difficulties in deploying such a system, the Board of Adjustment can consider a variance to allow additional height and consider the off-site impediment to wind flow as a valid hardship for the granting of a variance to a height that will clear the wind generation system from the impediment. 
For lots in the AG district, small scale wind generation systems shall be limited free-standing and/or roof mounted vertical axis helix wind turbines with a height that shall not exceed 75'. In the event that structures or vegetation on an adjoining property result in practical difficulties in deploying such a system, the Board of Adjustment can consider a variance to allow additional height and consider the off-site impediment to wind flow as a valid hardship for the granting of a variance to a height that will clear the wind generation system from the impediment. 
c)  Sound Level . The small wind energy system shall not exceed 60 decibels using the A scale (dBA), as measured at the site property line, except during short-term events such as severe wind storms and utility outages. 
d)  Shadow Flicker . Small wind energy systems shall be sited in a manner that does not result in significant shadow flicker impacts. Significant shadow flicker is defined as more than 30 hours per year on abutting occupied buildings. The applicant has the burden of proving that the shadow flicker will not have significant adverse impact on neighboring or adjacent uses. Potential shadow flicker will be addressed either through siting or mitigation measures. 
e)  Signs . All signs including flags streamers and decorative items, both temporary and permanent, are prohibited on the small wind energy system, except for manufacturer identification or appropriate warning signs. 
f)  Code Compliance . Small wind energy systems shall comply with all applicable sections of the Cibolo Building Code, as amended. 
g)  Aviation . The small wind energy system shall be built to comply with all applicable Federal Aviation Administration regulations. 
h)  Visual Impacts . It is inherent that small wind energy systems may pose some visual impacts due to the tower height needed to access wind resources. The purpose of this section is to reduce the visual impacts, without restricting the owner's access to the optimal wind resources on the property. 
I.  The applicant shall demonstrate through project site planning and proposed mitigation that the small wind energy system's visual impacts will be minimized for surrounding neighbors and the community. This may include, but not be limited to information regarding site selection, wind generator design or appearance, buffering, and screening of ground mounted electrical and control equipment. All electrical conduits shall be underground, except when the financial costs are prohibitive. 
II.  The color of the small wind energy system shall either be the stock color from the manufacturer or painted with a non-reflective, unobtrusive color that blends in with the surrounding environment. Approved colors include but are not limited to white, off-white or gray. 
III.  A small wind energy system shall not be artificially lit unless such lighting is required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). If lighting is required, the applicant shall provide a copy of the FAA determination to establish the required markings and/or lights for the small wind energy system. 
i)  Approved Wind Generators . The manufacturer and model of the wind generator to be used in the proposed small wind energy system must have been approved by the California Energy Commission or the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or a similar list approved by the State of Texas. 
j)  Utility Connection . If the proposed small wind energy system is to be connected to the power grid through net metering, it shall adhere to applicable Public Utility Commission of Texas standards and regulations. 
k)  Access . The tower shall be designed and installed so as not to provide step bolts or a ladder readily accessible to the public for a minimum height of 8 feet above the ground. All ground-mounted electrical and control equipment shall be labeled and secured to prevent unauthorized access. 
l)  Clearing . Clearing of natural vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for the construction, operation and maintenance of the small wind energy system and as otherwise prescribed by applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances. 
D.  Abandonment 
1.  At such time that a small wind energy system is scheduled to be abandoned or discontinued, the applicant will notify the City by certified U.S. mail of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuation of operations. 
2.  Upon abandonment or discontinuation of use, the owner shall physically remove the small wind energy system within 90 days from the date of abandonment or discontinuation of use. This period may be extended at the request of the owner and at the discretion of the building inspector. "Physically remove" shall include, but not be limited to: 
a)  Removal of the wind generator and tower and related above-grade structures. 
b)  Restoration of the location of the small wind energy system to its natural condition, except that any landscaping, grading or below-grade foundation may remain in its same condition at initiation of abandonment. 
3.  In the event that an applicant fails to give such notice, the system shall be considered abandoned or discontinued if the system is out-of-service for a continuous 12-month period. After the 12 months of inoperability, the building inspector may issue a Notice of Abandonment to the owner of the small wind energy system. The owner shall have the right to respond to the Notice of Abandonment within 30 days from Notice receipt date. After review of the information provided by the owner, the building inspector shall determine if the small wind energy system has been abandoned. If it is determined that the small wind energy system has not been abandoned, the building inspector shall withdraw the Notice of Abandonment and notify the owner of the withdrawal. 
4.  If an owner fails to respond to the Notice of Abandonment or if, after review by the City, it is determined that the small wind energy system has been abandoned or discontinued, the owner of the small wind energy system shall remove the wind generator and tower at the owner's sole expense within 3 months of receipt of the Notice of Abandonment. If the owner fails to physically remove the small wind energy system after the Notice of Abandonment procedure, the City may pursue legal action to have the small wind energy system removed at the owner's expense.

Notes: 
1  Lots for which an on-site sewage facility is proposed are subject to Title 30, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 285. The application of Chapter 285 may require larger minimum lot sizes than the City of Cibolo UDC. In such cases, the more restrictive shall apply. 
2  Maximum lot coverage is 35%, not to exceed 15,000 square feet. 
3  Minimum 18' front yard setback for garage, if not served from rear alley. (Pertains to vested SF-3 lots prior to Feb. 26, 2013.) 
4  May be reduced to 15' if parking provided at side or rear of building. 
5  The maximum lot coverage for this district shall not restrict the placement of one (1) accessory structure of less than 100 square feet, provided such structure is placed on skids and complies with the requirements of Article 15, and does not interfere with the use of any easement present. 
6  Minimum 15 feet between homes, but not less than 5 feet on either side of the common side lot line for lots vested prior to Feb. 26, 3013. 
7  Corner lots: Any garage or carport facing the side street must be set back not less than 20 feet. 
8  The maximum height pertains only to the height of a home. The height of accessory agricultural structures, such as barns, windmills and silos, is not restricted. 
9  A side yard setback of 5.0' feet shall be permitted for any SF-2 and SF-3 lot vested prior to Feb. 26, 2013. 
10  Requires two (2) side yards to have a combined total of 15 feet, with a 5' minimum on one side and a 10' minimum on the other side. 
11  Reference Appendix B for Height Exhibit. 
Section 14.2 - Lot Design 
A.  Lot sizes and dimensions shall conform to the minimum requirements of the appropriate zoning district. The lot area shall be computed including all easements. Changes in the required lot sizes and dimensions may only be allowed through rezoning or through the granting of a variance by the City Council. No lot shall be approved which does not meet the minimum requirements of the appropriate zoning district. 
B.  In residential subdivisions not served by public sewer, the City shall require the developer to cause a percolation test to be made to demonstrate that all requirements of Guadalupe County for private septic systems can be satisfied. In no case will the lot size in such subdivision be less than one acre. 
C.  Depth and width of properties to be used for commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. 
D.  Corner lots for residential development shall have sufficient width to permit the required building setbacks and proper orientation to both streets. In all single-family residential developments, corner lots shall be required to have a minimum of five (5) feet of additional lot width. 
E.  Where any lot backs up to a railroad right-of-way, regional scale gas line, regional scale electric transmission line, industrial area or any other land use which may have a dangerous effect on residential property, and where no marginal access street or other street is provided at the rear of such lot, an additional depth of twenty-five feet (25') shall be required. Where a lot sides to any of the above, an additional width of fifteen feet (15') shall be required. A planting screen, fence or non-access easement of at least ten feet (10') shall be provided along any lot line abutting any of the situations described in this section. Persons proposing developments that are adjacent to or traversed by major regional gas or electrical lines shall submit plats, construction plans or site plans to the affected utility and obtain a letter stating "no objection" to the proposed development before plats or site plans may be approved by the City. 
F.  Residential lots located on a cul-de-sac, or semi-cul-de-sac (commonly referred to as a knuckle) shall comply with the minimum lot width requirement at the required building setback line, with the lot width to be measured as a tangent line that connects the required building setback mark along each side lot line. Said lots shall also have a minimum arc length of thirty (30) feet along the cul-de-sac or knuckle in order to provide adequate driveway width. 
G.  Residential lots shall be oriented to take advantage of topography; the best relationship to the overall design of the neighborhood; and to minimize the effects of any surrounding depreciating land uses. 
H.  There shall be no residential lots facing directly upon an arterial street. Residential lots located along major collector streets should ideally back up to said streets, with primary access provided by a minor collector or minor street. 
I.  Side lot lines shall be as nearly perpendicular as practicable to the street or radial to curved streets, except where a waiver to this rule will provide a better street and lot layout. Every lot shall be provided with adequate access to a public street by direct frontage on such street. Rear and/or side driveway access to major streets shall be prohibited. 
J.  Every lot shall be provided with adequate access to a public street, either by direct frontage on such street, or by public access easement approved by the City Council. Rear and/or side driveway access to major arterial or collector streets shall be prohibited. 
K.  Minimum front setback lines from all streets shall be shown on all plats and shall conform to requirements of the applicable zoning district or Future Land Use Map designation for lots in the ETJ. The front line setback shall be measured from the point where the public right-of-way ends to the front face to the building, covered porch, covered terrace or attached accessory building. 
L.  Double frontage lots are prohibited, except when lots back up to highways, arterial streets or major collector thoroughfares. 
M.  All lots shall be numbered consecutively within each block. Lot numbering may be cumulative throughout the subdivision if the numbering continues from block to block in a uniform manner that has been approved on an overall street addressing plat. Lot numbers and address numbers must be approved by the city.

Section 14.3 - Modified Residential Standards 
A.  General Purpose and Descriptions 
This Section deals with specific residential products allowed within the Multi-family Residential zoning districts. Applicable residential products include townhomes, duplex, and condominiums. Although not a multi-family product, patio homes may use the modified standards in this section. 
B.  Area regulations 
Property and buildings shall conform to the applicable MF-1 or MF-2 zoning with the exceptions of the housing products presented in Section 14.3. In those instances a developer may: 
1.  Propose a zero lot line product 
&bull Maximum lot acreage of 20 acres in MF-1 and 30 acres in MF-2; 
&bull Minimum lot width to be 40 feet' 
&bull Minimum front BSL to be 15 feet; 
&bull Minimum side BSL to be 0 on one side and 10 feet on other side; 
&bull Minimum rear BSL to be 10 feet; 
For lots with the zero (0) BSL setback, the zero side must: 
a)  Have a roof overhang equipped with a gutter that may be extend a maximum of eight (8) inches into a neighboring lot. No other roof overhangs or extensions from a wall may extend into a neighboring lot. 
b)  Have storm gutters installed on the closest exterior roofline to an adjacent property if the general slope of the roof falls toward the neighboring lot. Gutters must include returns to direct the water to the lot of origin.

P.  Public and Private Schools, Churches, Landscaping Credits 
The City recognizes the unique circumstances associated with school and church development and the fact each of these uses may have considerable open space devoted to playgrounds, ball fields, outdoor recreation or areas for future expansion of facilities. For these uses, the City Planner has the discretion to issue landscaping credit toward fulfilling the landscaping requirements of this UDC subject to the following criterion: 
 Open space is landscaped with approved turf grass designated by this section, 
 Open space contains recreational facilities, including, but not limited to playgrounds and tennis courts, on pervious or impervious surfaces; 
 More substantial tree and shrub landscaping is planted along the perimeter of the school or church property lines; 
 Landscape Plan complies with all Landscape Buffer requirements of this section for protected uses. 
The decision of the City Planner may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
Q.  Variances 
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the authority to hear requests for variances to the Landscaping and Buffering requirements when the literal enforcement of these requirements would result in creation of an unnecessary hardship or impractical application of the plan considering the physical characteristics of the lot or parcel of land in question. All of the application requirements, variance hardship criteria, legal notice procedures, and application filing fee required for the granting of a zoning variance, as defined in this UDC, shall be applicable.

Section 17.2 - Protected Tree and Heritage Tree Preservation 
The provisions of this section shall apply to all developments, including commercial, industrial, single- and multi-family residential in the corporate limits of the City and the Cibolo ETJ. 
A.  Purpose and Intent 
The City seeks to: encourage the preservation of mature trees which once removed can be replaced only after generations, preserve protected trees during construction and control the removal of protected trees when necessary. The City intends to achieve the following: 
 Prohibit the indiscriminate clearing of property. 
 Protect and increase the value of residential and commercial properties within the City. 
 Maintain and enhance a positive image for the attraction of new business enterprises to the City. 
 Protect healthy quality trees and promote the natural ecological environmental and aesthetic qualities of the City. 
 Help provide needed shaded areas in order to provide relief from the heat by reducing the ambient temperature. 
a.  Affectivity 
All developments for which a Master Plan has not yet been submitted as of the effective date of this ordinance shall be subject to the requirements for tree protection and replacement specified herein. 
b.  Private Property 
Agricultural: Property zoned agricultural within the City Limits or appraised for agricultural in the City ETJ and being actively used for agricultural purposes shall be exempt from the requirements specified herein. 
c.  Homeowners 
The owner of a residence of two acres or less who uses the residence as a homestead shall be exempt from the tree protection and replacement requirements of this ordinance as it pertains to that residential property. 
d.  Exceptions 
A tree removal permit and tree protection and replacement requirements shall not be required under any of the following circumstances: 
? Damaged/Diseased Trees: The tree is dead, diseased, damaged beyond the point of recovery, in danger of falling, or endangers the public health, welfare or safety as determined by the City Administrator/City Manager or their designee. 
? Utility Service Interruption: The tree has disrupted a public utility service due to a tornado, storm, flood or other act of nature. Removal shall be limited to the portion of the tree reasonably necessary to reestablish and maintain reliable utility service. 
? Business Interests: The following business ventures shall be exempt from the requirements specified herein as follows: 
 Landscape Nursery: All licensed plant or tree nurseries shall be exempt from the tree protection and replacement requirements and from the tree removal permit requirements only in relation to those trees planted and growing on the premises which are so planted and growing for the sale to the general public. 
 Golf Course: Golf courses shall be exempt from the tree protection and replacement requirements and from the tree removal permit requirements for removal of protected trees within areas designated as tee boxes, fairways or greens. All other areas shall be subject to these requirements. 
e.  Deferral 
The Planning and Zoning Commission may consider a "deferral" request from the requirement to maintain all protected heritage trees when the literal enforcement of this requirement would result in the creation of an unnecessary hardship on impractical application of the plan considering the physical characteristics of the lot or parcel of land in question. 
B.  Protected and Heritage Tree Definitions 
  Contiguous Residential Lots - Contiguous lots include three or more adjoining lots. 
  DBH -Diameter-at-breast-height (caliper) - is a tree trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of 4.5 feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4.5 feet, the tree shall be measured in two places, the narrowest point beneath the split and 1/2 the sum of the calipers of the trunks immediately above the split. Whichever is the greater measurement is to be the measurement applied. If there is no single trunk above ground level to measure, the measurement shall be the sum of the main trunk, plus 1/2 of all other branches of the calipers of the various trunks at breast height. 
  Drip Line - A vertical line run through the outermost portion of the canopy of a tree and extending to the ground. 
  Governmental Entity - City, Independent School Districts, State and County property; property owned by the United States of America or other federal agencies. Examples of this would include City Hall, public parks, Corps of Engineers property, State R.O.W., library, fire stations, water tower sites or similar properties. 
  Mitigation - Tree replacement with an authorized species. 
  Multi-Trunk Tree - Tree with more than one trunk arising at or near the ground. 
  Protective Fencing - Snow fencing, chain link fence, barbed wire fence, orange vinyl construction fencing or other similar fencing with a four foot (4') approximate height. 
  Pervious - Water will permeate the surface. 
  Protected Trees - Trees having a 6-inch DBH and not belonging to the undesirable species list. 
  Heritage Trees - Trees having a 24-inch DBH and not belonging to the undesirable species list. 
  Root Protection Zone (RPZ) - The area of undisturbed natural soil around a tree defined by a concentric circle with a radius equal to the distance from the trunk to the outermost portion of the drip line. As a practical matter, this is the acute portion of the tree's root system. Approximately ninety percent (90%) of the tree's root mass occurs within the top three feet of the soil and most of the fine feeder roots which collect moisture and nutrients are located in the top six inches (6") of the soil. Typically, a tree's root system extends as much as two to three times the distance from the trunk to the dripline. 
  Tree Affidavit - Affirmation by the developer/land owner that there are not heritage or protected trees in a proposed development or subdivision. 
  Tree Crown - Parts of the tree above the trunk including leaves, branches, limbs and scaffold: the uppermost part of the tree. 
  Tree Preservation/Removal Permit - Permit required when heritage/protected trees are to be removed. 
  Significant tree - A tree of six (6) inches or greater DBH for any tree species listed in Section 17.1(L) as an "Approved Tree" 
C.  Tree Trunk Measurement 
  Straight Trunk : Trees with fairly straight, upright trunks should be measured four and a half (4.5) feet above the ground as shown below. 

  Trunk on an Angle or Slope : The trunk is measured at right angles to the trunk four and a half (4.5) feet along the center of the trunk axis, so the height is the average of the shortest and the longest sides of the trunk, as shown below: 

  Multi-Trunk Trees 
If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4.5 feet, the tree shall be measured in two places, the narrowest point beneath the split and 1/2 the sum of the calipers of the trunks immediately above the split. Whichever is the greater measurement is to be the measurement applied. If there is no single trunk above ground level to measure, the measurement shall be the sum of the main trunk, plus 1/2 of all other branches of the calipers of the various trunks at breast height. 

D.  Replacement and Protection of Existing Trees 
 Developers/subdividers must submit a tree affidavit or a tree preservation plan with their preliminary plat or development site plan. 
 Upon determining the number, size and location of any protected trees, the developer or subdivider must identify which of those protected trees can be preserved and which are proposed to be removed. A tree plan or tree survey showing these protected trees shall be submitted with the preliminary plat or site plan. The burden shall be upon the applicant to show the necessity for any protected tree to be removed. 
 When a protected tree is proposed to be removed, staff shall endeavor to seek any practical design solution that may be available in order to preserve any protected, significant or heritage tree. If a design solution should necessitate the need for a variance from any requirement of this UDC, the Planning and Zoning Commission in consideration of such variance, shall have the authority to grant a variance upon determining that the preservation of the tree is in the public interest and that the variance proposal would not result in health or safety issues. 
 When design solutions are not available to preserve protected trees , the developer or subdivider shall be required to determine the composite caliper of the protected trees proposed to be removed. The composite caliper of protected trees to be removed shall be multiplied by eighty percent (0.8%) to determine the aggregate amount of tree caliper that must be installed to replace protected trees to be removed. Protected trees to be removed must be replaced with any of the protected tree species listed in Section G below. The replacement tree requirement can be satisfied with the planting installation of many small trees or a few, or just one, large tree; provided that the aggregate replacement caliper is equal the existing aggregate proposed to be replaced times eighty percent (0.8%). For site plans, the aggregate caliper for replacement trees shall be in addition to the normal landscaping requirements of this UDC, with credits provided for maintaining protected trees. 
 For subdivisions, the aggregate caliper for replacement protected trees shall be in addition to the normal landscaping requirements of this UDC, which is two (2) trees per lot. The locations of where replacement trees will be planted shall be identified in a Tree Replacement Plan filed as a separate exhibit with the Preliminary Plat, Final Plat and site plan, with trees identified as an existing heritage/protected tree that may not be removed or a replacement tree. Ideally, replacement trees should be located in common HOA maintained greenbelts or a part of sedimentation and erosion control buffer to ensure the long term health and maintenance of these replacement trees. 
 No person, directly or indirectly, shall cut down, destroy, remove or move, or effectively destroy through damaging, any protected tree situated on property regulated by this UDC without first obtaining a tree-removal permit unless otherwise specified in this ordinance, except as follows: 
a.  Right-of-way owned or leased by a governmental entity as of the effective date of this ordinance. 
b.  Property owned or leased by a public utility excluding property used for administration offices or functions. 
 Any tree identified as a heritage tree , as defined herein, shall be integrated into the design of the development preserve these trees. If design solutions are not available to preserve a heritage tree, the developer shall be required to determine the caliper of the heritage trees proposed to be removed and multiply that figure by three (3.0), to determine the aggregate amount of tree caliper that must be installed to replace a heritage tree to be removed. A heritage tree to be removed must be replaced with a like tree or any of the approved protected significant tree species listed in the bullet below. The replacement tree requirement can be satisfied with the planting installation of many small trees or a few, or just one, large tree(s); provided that the aggregate replacement caliper is equal the existing aggregate proposed to be replaced times three (3.0). 
For site plans, the aggregate caliper for replacement trees shall be in addition to the normal landscaping requirements of this UDC, with credits provided for maintaining protected trees. Staff and the Planning and Zoning Commission have the authority to relax any standards of this UDC to preserve a heritage tree. 
 In those instances where protected and heritage trees cannot be replaced with like trees at the required 1:0.8 and 1:3 ratios, staff shall have the discretion to require the preservation of any existing significant tree species , excluding any undesirable tree species listed in this UDC, to compensate for lost protected or heritage tree caliper. 
For purposes of this section, a significant tree is defined as a tree of six (6) inches or greater DBH for any tree species listed in this section as an "Approved Tree". Arizona Ash and Mesquite are significant with at least one trunk being ten (10) inches or greater DHB and the following species are significant with at least one trunk being five (5) inches or greater DBH: 
Texas Persimmon Texas Redbud Texas Mountain Laurel Condalia Possum Haw (in floodplain only) Crabapple (in floodplain only) Blue Wood Condalia Brazil Tree  
If an applicant, after attempting to apply these alternative methods to tree preservation, still cannot comply with these requirements using these alternative methods, the applicant can utilize the tree deferral methods described below and request relief, or an alternative method for compliance, with the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
E.  Use of Retaining Walls to Preserve Trees 
When using retaining wall when natural grade must be raised or lowered, the tree well shall be designed in accordance with the design concepts depicted below: 

F.  Tree Affidavit and Tree Removal Permit Required 
 A tree affidavit must be submitted to the City Planner prior to applying for any site plan or plat to affirm that there no heritage or protected trees in the proposed development; or, when no heritage tree will be damaged or removed; or when no protected tree will be damaged or removed, or inside the street rights-of-way and drainage and utility easements for residential development. On plats, this requirement can be satisfied by a General Plat Note that affirms this fact. 
 Existing protected and heritage trees shall not be removed without first submitting a "Tree Affidavit" and obtaining a "Tree Removal Permit" per the following requirements: 
a.  A Tree Removal Permit may not be issued until one of the following actions occurs: 
? When a protected or heritage tree is located within the area of a proposed building footprints, or within the footprint of a building addition, the developer must tag these trees and request a meeting with the City Planner to assess the size, quality and locations of affected trees and determine if any development alternatives are available to preserve such trees and to determine if preservation of the protected tree is practical. If the City Planner determines that the preservation of the protected tree is not practical, or the protected tree is of nominal size, health or form; the City Planner may grant a "deferral" from the requirements of this section or may require that a replacement protected tree species be installed in accordance with this Article 17.2(D). 
? The City Planner reserves the right to require that the "deferral" determination be made by the Planning and Zoning Commission in those instances where the City Planner makes any one of the following findings: 
" The protected tree can be preserved by an alternative site design that is reasonable and practical; 
" The protected tree can be preserved by relaxing any other requirement of this UDC, such as, but not limited to a building setback, parking requirement. 
" The developer proposes an alternative preservation solution, such as preserving a stand of mature non-protected trees on the site, as an alternative to removing a protected or heritage tree(s). 
" The applicant is either unwilling or unable to modify their development plans to preserve a significant tree specimen. 
? In review of a deferral request, the Planning and Zoning Commission has the power to relax any requirement of this UDC in order to preserve a protected or heritage tree or to impose conditions of approval on the plat or site plan to preserve a tree or to implement an alternative tree preservation solution that implements the purposes of these regulations. The applicant making the deferral request is not required to demonstrate a hardship, but is required to demonstrate that a "good faith" effort was made to comply with this Article of the UDC. 
 An application for a tree preservation/removal permit is submitted when protected trees will be removed except inside the setbacks, street rights-of-ways and drainage and utility easements for residential development. A tree preservation plan/removal permit is required for the removal of a heritage tree regardless of its location. A tree preservation plan with an inventory of existing trees is required in order to calculate diameter-inches that will be removed versus number of inches that will be preserved. In addition, a tree preservation plan includes notes on methods of tree protection during construction and justification for removing protected or heritage trees. This permit will be issued after the City Code Enforcement Office has evaluated and approved the tree preservation plan. 
G.  Tree Preservation Plan 
 At a minimum a tree preservation plan includes: 
a.  Existing/proposed topography 
b.  Location of property lines, easements, approaches, right-of-ways, setbacks, parking areas, and sidewalks; 
c.  Location, species, and size in DBH of each heritage and protected tree except those located inside the footprint of proposed structures (for commercial development). Driveways and parking facilities are included as structures. 
d.  Tree inventory that summarizes total number of DBH inches to be removed and to be preserved (trees down to 1 and 1/2 inch DBH can be used in calculating preservation diameter inches). 
 Existing protected or heritage trees shall not be removed from the land without first obtaining a tree preservation/removal permit from the City. The land developer will submit a tree preservation plan and inventory to the City Planner. 
 The City has the approval authority for all tree preservation plans and will make note of the tree preservation plan approval on their plat review. Specifically, it will be noted that the tree preservation plan meets the City's requirements and is on file with the City Planner. 
H.  Tree Protection and Planting 
 The City of Cibolo Tree Preservation under the UDC is based on the fundamental precepts of sound urban forest management. Proposed development projects are evaluated on a case-by-case (and tree-by-tree) basis, which entails evaluating the existing tree resources on a site, understanding the dynamics of trees and development impacts, and negotiating a solution that results in a development with a balanced mixture of tree species and age. The goal of each review is to assure that, through a combination of preservation and reforestation, a final product is achieved which results in a diversified and sustainable urban forest. 
  
   ;hg;Trees 6 inches in diameter and greater are classified as "protected size" and receive enhanced preservation evaluation. Trees 24" in diameter of specified species are classified as "Heritage Trees." Both protected and Heritage trees require a permit to: remove, impact the critical root zone (i.e. utility trench, sidewalk, driveway, irrigation lines, foundation) or remove more than 30% of the canopy. 
 Tree protection will be installed before any site work is initiated and maintained for the duration of the construction work. Tree protection will consist of the following: 
a.  It will consist of fencing (orange mesh or chain link) placed around the RPZ. 
b.  No vehicles or construction materials/debris will be allowed in the RPZ. 
c.  No equipment shall be cleaned or other liquids deposited within the limits of the drip line of any Heritage/Protected Tree. This includes, but is not limited to, paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar, or other materials; 
d.  No signs, wires, or other attachments, other than those of a protective nature, which have been approved in the Tree Disposition Plan, shall be attached to any Heritage/Protected Tree; 
e.  Trespassing or throwing trash into a Protective Fence area is prohibited. 
f.  Any damage done to tree crowns or roots will be repaired immediately and any wounds on live oaks will be painted with pruning paint within 60 minutes to prevent oak wilt. 
g.  Wells or retaining walls around the RPZ will be used if proposed finished grades will raise or lower the natural RPZ grade by more than 6 inches. 
h.  The finished RPZ will be pervious. 
i.  For commercial, multifamily and other developments; a minimum of 25% of the total RPZ must be preserved. 
j.  For single family residential development of single or contiguous lots (contiguous lots include three or more lots), a minimum of 50% of total RPZ must be preserved. 
k.  For individual lots, 45% of total RPZ must be preserved. 
l.  Utility and flatwork per the original builder's plan are exempt for up to 45% of the RPZ. 
 A tree removal permit shall be required to remove heritage trees and protected trees. There is a mitigation requirement imposed for the removal of any and all heritage and/or protected trees. 
 Residential home builders in the City are required to plant, or preserve, a minimum of 2 approved trees per dwelling lot. When mature, the species planted will have an average crown greater than 15 feet in diameter. Trees planted or allowed to remain shall have minimum 2 inch DBH and an overall height of at least 8 feet when planted. Trees may not be planted in the right-of-way. 
 For single family residential developments; each home will have at least 2 approved trees, each with a minimum 2 inch DBH minimum. All trees shall be of an approved/authorized species. 
 Site plans should accommodate existing trees by providing islands in parking lots, grading, and landscaping surrounding structures. In commercial, multifamily, and other developments, trees will be added to the landscape, as necessary, to have the equivalent of 4 inch DBH per 50 feet of street frontage. 
Critical Root Zone (CRZ) : 
One foot from the tree trunk for each diameter inch of trunk size. Critical Root Zone (CRZ) Impacts 

Example : a tree with a 20-inch diameter trunk has a 20-foot CRZ and a 10-foot 1/2 CRZ. 
Tree Preservation Design Criteria 
Critical Root Zone (CRZ) Impacts 
A tree's root system ranges well beyond the dripline. The CRZ has been established to set a practical limit beyond which any loss of roots would not have a significant impact on a tree's survival. Design constraints often dictate that trees slated for preservation have some encroachment on their critical root zone. Weighing this fact with what appears to be an acceptable degree of risk to most trees, the following minimum design criteria (maximum allowable impacts) have been established. 
 A minimum of 50% of the CRZ must be Preserved at natural grade, with natural ground cover, and 
 No cut or fill greater than four (4) inches will be located closer to the tree trunk than the 1/2 CRZ. 

  
  
Tree Protection 
In order to assure that trees are adequately preserved, tree protection fencing is required for trees within the limits of construction. 
Fencing should protect the entire Critical Root Zone (CRZ) area. Fencing is required to be chain link mesh at a minimum height of five feet. A 6-inch layer of mulch within the entire available root zone area is required for trees which have any disturbance indicated within any portion of the Critical Root Zone.

ARTICLE 18. - TRANSPORTATION 

Section 18.1 - Public Streets 
Streets shall be designated, designed and constructed as necessary to comply with all requirements of the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual and the additional standards contained in this Article. 
A.  Street Layout 
The arrangement, extent, character, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the Future Thoroughfare Plan and the Comprehensive Master Plan. Collector streets shall provide adequate circulation within the neighborhood and yet discourage through traffic. The street layout shall be arranged to achieve the most desirable development of the entire neighborhood unit with appropriate consideration of creeks, drainage channels, wooded areas and other topographical features, which lend themselves to special treatment. Permits must be obtained from TxDOT for driveways and streets accessing any State highway. The proposed location of driveways must comply with all applicable City and State safety requirements. 
B.  Relation to Adjoining Street s 
Adjoining areas shall be continued and tied into the street layout. 
C.  Projection of Streets 
When adjoining properties are not yet subdivided, the arrangement of streets shall provide for the proper projection of streets into the adjoining non-subdivided areas, and will be required to comply with the neighborhood pattern or conform to the Future Thoroughfare Plan and Future Land Use Map. 
D.  Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths 
In newly developed subdivisions, right-of-way shall be dedicated by the developer and pavement width constructed in accordance with the Future Thoroughfare Plan, the City Design and Construction Manual and all other requirements of this UDC. The classifications of the streets shall be as determined by the City Engineer and approved by the City Council. The Cibolo Design and Construction Manual provides the requirements for right-of-way and pavement widths, median widths, crown or cross slope and related technical design standards of the City. In construction projects by the City, where the desired right-of-way is not available for the pavement width specified in the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual, the City Engineer will determine the pavement width to be used on the project. Said pavement width must be approved by the City Council. 
E.  Responsibilities of the Developer 
The subdivider shall pay all design, engineering, labor, and construction costs for transportation related improvements required by this UDC, except to the extent that this section specifically provides for full or partial payment by the City. The provisions of this section shall apply to resubdivisions as well as to subdivisions. Specifically, the developer shall be responsible for the following: 
1.  Phasing of development or improvements in order to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities; 
2.  Extensions of public facilities and roadways, including any necessary on- and off-site facilities, to connect to existing public facilities; 
3.  Providing and/or procuring all necessary property interests, including rights-of-way and easements, for the facilities (whether on-site or off-site); 
4.  Providing proof to the City of adequate public facilities; 
5.  Making provisions for future expansion of the public facilities as needed to serve future developments, subject to the City s oversize participation policies, if applicable; 
6.  Providing for all operations and maintenance of the public facilities, or providing proof that a separate entity will be responsible for the operations and maintenance of the facilities; 
7.  Providing all fiscal security required for the construction of the public facilities; 
8.  Obtaining approvals from the applicable utility providers other than the City; 
9.  Complying with all requirements of the utility providers, including the City and applicable drainage districts; and 
10.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require any dedication or construction that is not explicitly required by the standards within this UDC. 
F.  Off-Site/Perimeter Road Improvements 
Where a subdivision is adjacent to or is served by a collector or arterial street(s) that does not meet the City's minimum standards for roadway construction and/or pavement/right-of-way width, the subdivider shall make the improvements to the substandard collector or arterial street(s) and intersections as are necessary to mitigate traffic impacts generated by the subdivision or related projects. Said improvements shall be established through the completion of a Traffic Impact Analysis that meets the minimum standards specified in this Article. The City may, at its discretion, participate in the costs to oversize the improvements with the subdivider as set out herein and subject to the City's participation policies regarding oversizing improvements. 
G.  Findings on Necessity for R.O.W. Dedication, Construction and Easement Dedication 
1.  Support for New Development 
a.  New development must be supported by adequate levels of public facilities and services, as required and defined herein, and as limited by Section 18.1.E. 
b.  It is necessary and desirable to provide for dedication of rights-of-way and easements for capital improvements, as limited by Section 18.1.E herein, to support new development at the earliest stage of the development process. 
2.  Essential Nexus 
There is an essential nexus between the demand on public facilities systems created by a new development and the requirement to dedicate rights-of-way and easements and to construct capital improvements to offset such impacts. 
3.  Developer Obligations; Dedication and Construction of Improvements 
The developer shall dedicate all rights-of-way and easements for capital improvements within the rights-of-way or easements for those transportation improvements needed to adequately serve a proposed development consistent with the applicable master facilities plans and construction design standards, as limited in Section 18.1.E, and shall construct said improvements, whether the facilities are located on, adjacent to or outside the boundaries of the property being developed in accordance with this UDC. 
4.  Timing of Dedication and Construction 
a.  Initial Provision for Dedication or Construction . The City shall require an initial demonstration that a proposed development shall be adequately served by public facilities and services, as limited in Section 18.1.E, at the time for approval of the first development application that portrays a specific plan of development, including but not limited to a petition for establishing a Planned Development (PD) zoning district, or other overlay zoning district; a petition for an annexation agreement or a development agreement; an application for a Land Study, or an application for a Preliminary Plat or Final Plat. As a condition of approval of the development application, the City may require provision for dedication of rights-of-way or easements for, and construction of, capital improvements to serve the proposed development. 
b.  Deferral of Obligation . The obligation to dedicate rights-of-way for or to construct one or more capital improvements to serve a new development may be deferred until approval of a subordinate development permit, or, in the case of a development proposed to be developed in phases, until a subsequent phase of the development, on the sole discretion of the City, upon written request of the property owner, or at the City initiative. As a condition of deferring the obligation, the City may require that the developer enter into a capital improvements agreement pursuant to Article 20 of this UDC, specifying the time for dedication of rights-of-way for or construction of capital improvements serving the development. 
c.  Relief from Obligations . In order to achieve proportionality between the demands created by a proposed development on public facilities and the obligation to provide adequate public facilities, as limited in Section 18.1.E, the City may participate in the costs of public facilities in accordance with this Article or relieve the property owner of some or part of the obligations in response to a petition for relief from a dedication or construction requirements. 
5.  Roadway Participation Policies - Improvement of Adjacent (Perimeter) Roads and Utilities 
a.  Improvement of Adjacent Substandard Road . When an area within a proposed plat, whether residential or nonresidential, abuts on one or both sides of an existing substandard road or utility facility, or a planned or future road or utility facility as shown on the City Thoroughfare Plan and/or adopted plans related to water and wastewater, the developer shall be required to improve the road (including appurtenant sidewalks, paths, bikeways, barrier-free ramps, storm drainage facilities, screening and landscaping, median openings, left turn lanes, and water quality or erosion controls) and utility facilities, to bring the facilities to City standards, or to replace them with standard City road or utility facilities at no cost to the City. 
b.  Calculation of Cost . 
i.  The developer's share of improvements to a substandard perimeter road is the equivalent of one-half of the pavement width of a collector street, per the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual requirements for collector street design, along the entire frontage of the subdivision. 
ii.  The developer's share of improvements to a roadway when a subdivision is to be located on both sides of a roadway is the full width of a primary collector street, per the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual requirements for collector street design. The roadway shall be improved by the developer on each side of the road along the entire length of the subdivision, per the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
iii.  The City shall participate in the costs of perimeter roads in excess of the developer's fair share obligations and where such costs are not borne by another public entity, and in cases where the application of the standards in this Section result in a disproportional burden on the development, as determined by the City Engineer and approved by the City Council. 
6.  Improvements . All streets bordering subdivisions shall be improved, and/or rights-of-way platted, in accordance with standards prescribed herein. If the subdivider widens existing pavement, the existing pavement shall be cut back a distance required by the City Engineer to assure adequate sub-base and pavement joint before additional paving material is laid on top. 
a.  Existing Boundary Streets . For boundary streets which exist to some degree, for example, by previous partial dedication or prescriptive easement, the following standards shall apply. 
i.  For all classifications of such streets, the subdivider must dedicate additional right-of-way to complete the desired street width from the desired roadway centerline to the final edge of right-of-way. Dedication of more than half this additional increment may be required, in some instances, to maximize use of existing roadway and/or ensure a consistent street alignment with a minimum of undesirable curvature. 
ii.  For all classifications of such streets, except expressways, the subdivider must pave one-half the additional portion of street right-of-way remaining to be paved, according to the adopted Thoroughfare Plan of the City for improving that street alignment. In no instance, however, shall there be required any more than thirty-three feet (33') of additional paving, nor shall there result any less than a twenty-six-foot (26') paved roadway. In lieu of actual street improvement, the subdivider shall have the following options: 
 The subdivider shall contribute to the City an amount of money necessary to complete all paving and curbing required. These funds shall be held, and eventually disposed of, in the manner described within Article 20 of this UDC; or 
 If the subdivision includes no more than two lots, then the subdivider may execute a Developer Agreement or Public Improvements Agreement which runs with the ownership of the land and which obligates the landowner to pay the City on demand the amount of money necessary to cover the cost of all required public street improvements. The said Agreement shall be on a City designated form, signed by the property owner, notarized, and filed with the official property records of the county in which the property is located. 
 If the right-of-way for an expressway lies adjacent to or forms part of the subdivision boundary, no paving improvements shall be required of the subdivider. 
b.  New Boundary Streets . For new boundary streets forming part of the subdivision boundary, the following standards shall apply. 
i.  Minor Streets and Subcollectors. 
Where a minor street or subcollector forms part of the subdivision boundary, the subdivider shall dedicate right-of-way sufficient to make such street conform to requirements of this Division. The subdivider shall also improve such street in conformance with all standards and specifications of the City, including installation of curbs on both sides of the street. 
ii.  Other Streets. 
Where a proposed thoroughfare (other than a minor street or subcollector) forms part of a subdivision boundary, the subdivider shall dedicate approximately one-half the additional right-of-way necessary to comprise the full street width required by this Division, up to a maximum of one hundred feet (100'). Dedication of more than half this additional increment may be required, in some instances, to maximize the use of existing streets and/or to ensure a consistent street alignment with a minimum of undesirable curvature. 
iii.  Partial Boundary Street. 
If the right-of-way for an arterial or collector street forms part of the subdivision boundary, the subdivider shall comply with requirements of either one of the following two paragraphs: 
1.  The subdivider shall pave thirty-three feet (33') of the right-of-way in accordance with City standards and specifications. 
2.  The subdivider shall contribute to the City an amount of money equal to that necessary to complete paving and curbing as required by this UDC. 
iv.  Expressway. 
If the right-of-way for an expressway lies adjacent to or forms part of the subdivision boundary, no paving improvements shall be required of the subdivider. 
Section 18.2 - Private Streets 
A.  Intent and Purpose . 
It is the intent of these private street regulations:

C.  Administrative Procedures. 
In order to qualify for consideration for private streets, the applicant must submit a Land Study of the proposed development demonstrating compliance with the criteria set forth below. For private street developments of twenty (20) or fewer lots, a Preliminary Plat of the proposed development may be submitted concurrently with the Land Study. 
D.  Private Street Design Standards . 
1.  Required. The design and construction of the infrastructure within a private street subdivision shall conform to the same rules, regulations, standards, and specifications established for public subdivisions and as regulated in the City UDC and Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
2.  Promulgation. The City Engineer is hereby authorized to promulgate rules, regulations, standards, and specifications for the design and construction of improvements unique to a private street subdivision in accordance with Article 2 of this UDC. 
3.  Amendments. An amendment may be made from time to time in accordance with Article 3 of this UDC. 
4.  Private Street Structures: 
a.  Project perimeter fences at project entry access points, entry monuments, and security stations, may be erected within the public utility and storm sewer easement, provided they do not impede the installation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of public utilities and storm sewers within the easement. 
b.  Where security stations are a part of a larger, multipurpose structure, only that portion of the structure, which functions as a security station, may encroach the building line adjacent to the private street.

4.  If the property owners' association fails to maintain access as required in this article, the city may enter the subdivision and remove any gate or device, which is a barrier to access, at the sole expense of the property owners' association. 
F.  Guidelines for Development . 
The proposed development shall be evaluated with respect to the following guidelines as part of the review and approval process for all private street developments. Subsections 1-3 below are mandatory and shall be required for all private street developments. Subsections 4-7 below are recommended guidelines, the degree to which each is satisfied should be reviewed by Cibolo city staff, the Planning and Zoning Commission, and City Council, as a part of the determination of the merits of any individual proposed private street development. 
1.  The area shall be within the corporate limits of the city. 
2.  The development plan shall not impede the current or future street circulation needs of the area, especially any needed collector or arterial street route, or adequate access to any adjoining tract. 
3.  Area shall not disrupt an existing or proposed city public pedestrian pathway, hike and bike trail or park. 
4.  If the area is intended for residential use (may be an existing or proposed residential development), it should be zoned solely as a residential zoning district (that is, a zoning district the stated purpose of which is to provide for primarily residential uses), except in the case of a PD (Planned Development) zoning district, in which case the area should be designated solely for residential use. 
5.  The area should be bounded on all sides by natural barriers, manmade barriers such as a greenbelt, hike and bike trail, golf course or park, screening walls, or collector thoroughfares. 
6.  Except where substantial existing natural or manmade barriers would render the requirement unreasonable, each such development should have direct access to a two-lane collector street width, unless a lesser width two-lane collector is determined adequate due to an absence of need for on-street parking), in addition to any access to one or more arterial streets that may be proposed. Any private street development of such limited size that it does not require direct collector street access for appropriate traffic service may instead have access to a collector street within the neighborhood by way of another local street. 
7.  The proposed private street subdivision should not result in an overconcentration of such developments, to the extent of dominating the neighborhood development pattern. 
G.  General Design Requirements . 
1.  The private street system must comply with design standards of this UDC. All references in this UDC to "public right-of-way" shall apply to private street lots.

The City Council shall not permit "island" subdivisions, lots or streets that would be surrounded by the flood waters. 
2.  All subdivisions containing more than thirty (30) lots must have at least two (2) points of vehicular access and must be connected to the City's improved thoroughfare and street system by one or more approach roads of such dimensions and constructed of such standards that are in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual for public streets Two (2) points of vehicular access" shall be construed to mean that the subdivision has at least two (2) roads accessing the subdivision from the City's improved thoroughfare/street system. The City Council may, at its discretion and upon a finding that such will not compromise the public safety or impede emergency access, accept a single median-divided entrance from the City's improved thoroughfare/street system provided that the median extends into the subdivision for an unbroken length of at least one hundred and fifty (150) feet to an intersecting interior street that provides at least two (2) routes to the interior of the subdivision. The City Council shall have the discretion to approve a Phasing Plan as a part of a Land Study that specifies where and when a second point of access will be provide and/or to require a Maintenance Bond equal to the cost of proving a second access point to the development. 
E.  Access to Principal and Secondary Arterial Streets and Highways 
Access to principal and secondary arterial streets should be limited to protect the flow of traffic from the lots. A one foot (1') non-access easement shall be provided along principal and secondary arterial streets and highways when lots have access to another public right-of-way. 
F.  Partial or Half Streets and Adjacent Streets 
1.  Wherever a half-street has already been provided adjacent to an area proposed to be subdivided, the subdivider of the other remaining portion of the street shall be platted with such subdivision. Where part of a street is being dedicated along a common property line where no roadway currently exists, the first dedication of ROW shall be of an adequate width so that the developer shall be responsible for at least 24 feet of clear pavement width, as considered necessary by the City Engineer. Additional R.O.W. and easements shall be dedicated as necessary to install signage and to perform grading activities and to conform to the requirements of this UDC, the Future Thoroughfare Plan and the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual, except as may be limited by Section 18.1.G of this Article. 
2.  New half streets that do not conform to the Future Thoroughfare Plan, this UDC and Cibolo Design and Construction Manual shall not be platted without the expressed approval of City Council as a part of a Public Improvements Phasing Schedule or proffer a Public Improvements Agreement for impact fee credits to complete road improvements designated on the Future Thoroughfare Plan. 
3.  Where a proposed subdivision abuts an existing street, or half street, that does not conform to the UDC, the Future Thoroughfare Plan of Cibolo Design and Construction Manual, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate any additional 1/2 right-of-way necessary to meet the street width requirement, except as may be limited by Section 18.1.G of this Article. The developer may submit a Public Improvements Phasing Schedule or proffer a Public Improvements Agreement for impact fee credits to complete road improvements designated on the Future Thoroughfare Plan. 
4.  Street improvements required by this section shall include right-of-way dedication, paving, curb and guttering, shoulder improvements and sidewalks, as required by this UDC and the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
5.  In the event that a street stub is provided to connect to a future phase or a future adjoining development, the City Engineer and City Council may consider a temporary cul-de-sac, alternative turn around design, such as a hammer head, or a Maintenance Bond, as may be appropriate, to provide a temporary turn around or an eventual connection to the adjoining phase or an adjoining development. 
G.  Street Signs and Traffic Control Devices 
1.  Street signs in new subdivisions; including street name, speed limit, stop and yield signs, etc. shall be paid for by the developer, and shall be provided by and installed by the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual.

The maintenance of landscaping installed in a median shall be the responsibility of the developer or a duly authorized Home Owner Association and shall be irrigated and maintained in accordance with all Landscaping requirements contained in this UDC. Median landscaping shall be subject to the approval of a Landscape Plan and the issuance of permits for any electrical, irrigation or structural improvements. The City shall reserve the right to require the developer or its successors and/or assigns, to trim landscaping as necessary to ensure that the right-of-way is clear for traffic. Any islands that are not maintained in accordance with this section may be removed by the City and shall be removed at the expense of the developer or its successors and/or assigns, after due notice and the written recommendation by the City Engineer. 
3.  Foliage of hedges, trees, and shrubs located in or encroaching into public right-of-way shall be maintained such that the minimum overhang above a sidewalk shall be 8 feet and the minimum overhang above an arterial or collector street shall be 14 feet. 
Section 18.8 - Street Names and Street Numbers 
Names of new streets shall not duplicate the names of existing streets within the City and its ETJ unless the new street is a continuation of or part of a future continuation of such existing street. Street names shall be chosen to avoid name similarity or confusion. A new street name shall not differ from an existing street name solely by the addition of a different auxiliary designation such as "avenue", "way", "boulevard", etc. Names of all new streets shall be subject to coordination on an area and region wide basis. Street names shall have prior approval of the United States Postal Service, Bexar Metro 911, and the applicable County officials. Street addresses should also be coordinated with present existing addresses. 
Proposed street names shall be submitted with a Land Study and Preliminary Plat. When a Final Plat is submitted, the applicant must submit a copy the names selected by the U.S. Postal Service as "approved" street names. The City reserves the right to request a name change prior to plat recordation to avoid name similarity and avoid confusion. The City, in concert with the U.S.P.S. and Bexar Metro 911, will determine street numbers and advise the subdivider as to the street numbers and sequencing. 
Section 18.9 - Construction Standards 
All public and private streets shall be constructed with reference to base, surfacing, curbs, grades, horizontal curves and intersection curve radius in accordance with the standards prescribed in the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual and any other applicable specifications of the City. The City Engineer can consider deviations from the City Construction Standards when a deviate is determined to acceptable and appropriate based on accepted engineering standards and practices and/or appropriate for the specific location based on specific circumstances of any improvement. Any other deviation from a Construction Standard of the City shall require City Council approval. 
Section 18.10 - Street Drainage 
The storm drainage for all local streets shall be designed to a 10-year storm capacity curb face to curb face and to a twenty-five (25) year flood frequency within right-of-way of each local street. All arterial and collector streets designated as such on the Future Thoroughfare Plan shall be designed to a 20-year storm event curb face to curb face and to a twenty-five (25) year flood frequency within right-of-way of each collector and arterial street. Runoff rates shall be computed in all cases on the basis of ultimate development of the entire watershed contributing runoff water to the proposed subdivision, on the basis of concrete lined channels and streets carrying stormwater in the contributing area. All necessary storm drainage improvements shall be in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
Section 18.11 - Curb and Gutter 
Curbs and gutters shall be installed by the subdivider on both sides of all streets within or forming part of the boundary of the subdivision. Curb and gutter shall be constructed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. The City Engineer may vary the requirements for construction of curb and gutter or may approve an alternative curb and gutter construction when legitimate professional engineering standards and practices, local conditions, environmental considerations or factors relative to density and stormwater management warrant a deviation. 
Section 18.12 - Street Lights and Electric Conduit Systems 
A.  The primary function of street lighting is to illuminate critical locations along the roadway to improve the maneuverability of traffic at night. In residential areas, street lights shall be are installed at intersections, cul-de-sacs, curves, and mid-block between intersections a maximum of 600 feet where the block length is longer than 900 feet and at the entrance to each development.

Section 18.13 - Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) 
The purpose of a TIA is to assess the effects of specific development activity on the existing and planned roadway system. It is the intent of this ordinance to make traffic access planning an integral part of the development process. The thoroughfare network for Cibolo is based on operational values of Level of Service D or better as a criterion for design purpose. Level of Service D is the industry standard and balances vehicle movement, impact on neighborhoods, and costs. 
1.  Definitions 
Background Traffic - Existing traffic not created or associated with traffic generated by the development. 
Projected Traffic Volumes - The number of vehicles that are calculated to be present after a project is completed. 
Study Area - The boundaries in which the study is conducted. 
Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) - An in depth analysis of existing and proposed traffic. 
Traffic Queue - A line of vehicles stacking in line to make a traffic movement. 
Trip Distribution - A percentage estimates trip distribution per turning movement from a development. 
Trip Generation Summary - A table summarizing trip generation characteristics of a development for an entire day; including AM and PM peak periods, rates, units and assumptions used to calculate the number of trips. 
2.  TIA Requirement 
A TIA is required to be submitted for City approval at the time of platting and/or site plan review for those developments that are expected to meet any traffic threshold level of change described below. The City reserves the right to require a TIA for land developments that do not meet the threshold requirements, but may impact a sensitive area with traffic issues or may be a known public concern. 
 More than 100 Peak Hour Trip (PHT) generation 
 More than 5,000 vehicle trips per day generation 
 More than 100 acres of property is involved 
 Any changes or alterations to the Cibolo Future Thoroughfare Plan 
 Land uses that have unusually high traffic generation, or fleet vehicle, characteristics. 
a.  In the event that a land development project, for which a TIA is required under this Section, is not completed within five (5) years from the date of submission of the TIA to the City, the TIA shall expire, and a new TIA shall be required, and the completion of the development project shall be analyzed based on the new TIA. For phased land projects, where the time to build out all phases exceeds five (5) years, an interim phase that occurs prior to the five year (5) expiration of a TIA shall be analyzed based on the existing TIA; however, phases that shall be completed after the five year (5) expiration of a TIA shall be analyzed based on the new TIA. 
Note: For the purposes of Texas Local Government Code Chapter 245, a TIA submission to the City is a permit submission and TIA'S expire five (5) years after such submission. 
3.  TIA Responsibility 
The primary responsibility for assessing the traffic impacts associated with a proposed development rests with the applicant. The City serves in a review capacity for this process. Both the City and the developer share responsibility to consider all reasonable solutions in the mitigation of transportation problems identified through the study process. The TIA must be prepared, signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered to practice in Texas, with experience in Transportation Engineering sufficient to assess traffic impacts. 
4.  Compliance with Cibolo Design and Construction Manual 
A TIA shall be completed in accordance with all TIA requirements specified in the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
5.  TIA Scope Assessment 
Prior to the submittal of any TIA, the developer, or the Civil or Traffic Engineer representing the developer, shall meet with the City Engineer, or his duly authorized agent, to formally determine the scope of the TIA. The scope of the TIA shall be sufficiently scaled to reflect the traffic impact of the proposed use that is causing the TIA to be submitted and may include pedestrian and bicycle elements depending on the nature and location of the proposed use(s). Once the scope of the TIA is established, the City Engineer, or his agent, shall formally stipulate said scope in writing. The City Engineer reserves the right to expand, or to contract, the scope of the TIA as additional details about the proposed use(s) causing the TIA to be prepared is ascertained, provided that such an expansion of scope is based on sound generally accepted traffic engineering practices. 
6.  TIA Threshold Analysis 
In order to determine when a TIA is required, the TIA Threshold Analysis worksheet listed as Table 18.1 (PG. 233 of this UDC) shall be utilized. 
7.  TIA Review 
The TIA shall be reviewed by the City Engineer and any other necessary review authorities. Review comments shall be provided to the applicant for response. Response by the applicant shall be in the form of a letter, technical memorandum, or other appropriate document. The applicant shall submit final copies of the TIA to the City Engineer containing all modifications prior to final approval of the application for which the TIA was conducted. 
8.  City Assistance in Development 
During the course of providing for improvements, the City may cooperate with the developer in the use of its governmental powers to assist in the timely and cost effective implementation of improvements. Assistance shall not mean financial aid in actual easement acquisition, construction or engineering costs. Specifically, the City may agree to the following forms of assistance: 
a.  Assist in the acquisition of necessary right-of-way and easements; 
b.  Assist in the relocation of utilities; 
c.  Assist in obtaining approvals from applicable County entities; 
d.  Assist in obtaining approvals from TxDOT; 
e.  Enter into Public Improvement Agreements as consideration in lieu of impact fees; and 
f.  Assist in securing financial participation for major street improvements from applicable County entities, TxDOT or the Metropolitan Planning Organization. 
9.  TIA Revisions 
It is recognized that the scope of the developer's plans may change from time to time. The monitoring reports may also demonstrate changes in the area street conditions and travel patterns within and around the City. Periodic updates to the TIA may be required to address these issues and identify changes to the level of service at study intersections and streets. These updates shall address modifications to the magnitude and timing of improvements recommended by the original TIA. Any TIA amendments must be acceptable to the City, and TxDOT, when applicable. 
10.  Off-Site Improvements 
Based on the results of a TIA, and in those instances where the City believes public safety is at risk, the property owner shall make improvements to off-site collector and arterial streets and intersections necessary to mitigate traffic impacts generated by the development or in conjunction with related developments; with said improvements being roughly proportional to the impact of the proposed development. The City may participate in the costs of oversize improvements with the property owner as set out herein, and subject to the City's cost participation policies on oversized improvements. 
11.  Construction Easements 
Construction easements, in addition to rights-of-way, may be required when adequate width for streets and/or utilities is not available. 
12.  Intersection Improvements and Traffic Control Devices . 
Intersection improvements and traffic control devices shall be installed as may be required by the City based on the recommendations of an approved TIA for traffic safety and efficiency. Construction and design standards shall be in accordance with Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
Table 18.1 

13.  Mitigation Improvements and Roughly Proportionate Determination 
A.  The purpose of the TIA is to identify if any mitigation improvements are necessitated by and attributable to the proposed development. Required mitigation improvements may include the following: 
1.  Implementation of the Future Thoroughfare Plan; including right-of-way dedication (right-of-way dedication value shall be determined using the most recent appraisal district land values) and/or construction in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
2.  Improvements identified by the TIA based on peak hour trip generation data, turn lane assessment and traffic impact analysis. 
3.  Other improvements may include, but are not limited to, pavement widening, turn lanes, median islands, access controls, curbs, sidewalks, traffic signalization, traffic signing and pavement markings. 
4.  Improvements to the TxDOT right-of-way required by the city, including right-of-way dedication, as approved by TxDOT. 
Minimum Areas to be addressed in Roughly Proportionate Determination 
Right-of-way dedication for adjacent exterior streets Improvements to substandard streets Projecting streets Right-of-way dedication and construction of Future Thoroughfare Plan streets Dedication of arterial or major collector streets Upgrade existing traffic signals New traffic signal construction Other improvements identified in the TIA Right-of-way dedication and construction of left and/or right turn lanes  
B.  For phased development projects, implementation of the mitigation improvements must be completed no later than the completion of the project phase for which the TIA shows it was required. Plats for project phases subsequent to a phase for which a mitigation improvement is required may be approved only if the mitigation improvements are completed or bonded by the developer. 
C.  Following the identification of mitigation improvements and any other improvements necessitated by and attributable to the development, the applicant shall utilize the methodology developed and approved by the city to determine if the mitigation improvements identified are roughly proportionate to the impact of the proposed development. 
1.  At the conclusion of the TIA, the applicant will summarize all of the mitigation improvements identified in the TIA and the approximate total cost of all mitigation improvements including design, engineering and construction. Mitigation improvements that only serve the proposed development (such as site plan related recommendations and right-turn lanes into and out of a development) that provide minimal benefits to the study area roadway network shall not be included in the cost of the mitigation improvements (when compared to the maximum amount of improvements attributable to the proposed development). 
2.  The applicant will utilize the approved methodology made available by the city to determine the maximum amount of improvements (measured in dollars) that may be attributable to the proposed development. 
3.  The applicant shall then compare the cost of the mitigation improvements to the maximum probable amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development. 
a.  If the cost of the mitigation improvements is less than or equal to the maximum amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development, then the mitigation improvements identified in the traffic impact analysis are said to be roughly proportionate to the impact of the development. 
b.  If the cost of the mitigation improvements is greater than the maximum amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development, then the mitigation improvements identified in the traffic impact analysis are limited to an amount roughly equal to the maximum amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development. 
4.  The methodology utilized by the city shall be as follows. The maximum amount of improvements attributable to a development is roughly proportional to the demand created by a development. This value shall be determined (measured in dollars) by multiplying the following values together: 
a.  Intensity of the development (using independent variable identified in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, e.g. number of dwelling units, number of one thousand (1,000) square feet of leasable floor area, etc.); 
b.  Number of vehicles-the peak hour trip generation rate for the applicable peak hour (from the most current version of the ITE Trip Generation Manual Information); 
c.  Length of the trip-the anticipated trip length to/from the development on the city's thoroughfare network (a minimum value of 1.0 miles and a maximum value of 1.5 miles shall apply); and 
d.  Cost per vehicle-mile-the average cost per vehicle-mile for the City to deliver a typical roadway capacity improvement project based upon the current City Engineer estimates. The Average Unit Price List shall be reviewed by the City Engineer on a regular basis to ensure the Average Unit Price List is consistent with current construction costs. 
5.  The methodology shall be reviewed by the City Engineer on a regular basis to ensure the methodology is consistent with current construction costs and engineering criteria. 
6.  Projects in a valid master development plan or planned unit development where mitigation improvements have been previously constructed at the cost of the applicant shall receive credit for these improvements. The credit for improvements shall be determined using the cost of the improvements at the time they were constructed. This value shall be included with the total cost of the mitigation improvements required to serve the development. The land uses previously constructed or planned for shall also be included in the calculation of the maximum probable amount of improvements that may be attributable to the development. 
D.  Limitations on Traffic Impact Mitigation . Limitations on traffic impact mitigation requirements are as follows: 
1.  Improvements that have been planned and funded through a capital improvement project that exceed the proposed mitigation measures recommended in the TIA are not required. The capital improvement must be planned to be awarded to a contractor for construction within one (1) year following the completion of the project phase requiring the improvement to be considered as a mitigation improvement. 
E.  Exemptions . The city finds and determines that certain factors, such as interconnected street systems, mixed uses, and the availability of pedestrian facilities, can result in fewer trips than isolated, low-density subdivisions. Certain development patterns produce fewer trips and shorter trips than developments subject to conventional zoning or located on the fringe of the metropolitan area. The city hereby finds that traffic patterns and infrastructure within its urban core are established, and that there is a strong public policy to encourage reinvestment in the city's downtown areas. Further, the city hereby finds that there is a strong public policy to encourage infill development and that there is little opportunity to expand transportation capacity in many infill areas without destroying the city's historic built environment. Accordingly, the Old Town Overlay zoning district is exempt from the provisions of this section. 
Section 18.14 - Clear Site Triangle 
A.  Generally . 
No fence, wall, sign, foliage, berming or other structure or obstruction which will obstruct the driver's view (sight lines) of traffic approaching the intersection shall be placed in the sight triangle. These sight lines shall be unobstructed between a height of three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above the elevation of the street centerline and shall be placed on any corner lot in the areas specified by this subsection or the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards; whichever is more stringent. 
B.  Requirements .

C.  Exemptions . 
1.  Utility poles, traffic control signs or other signs related to public safety, and trees eighteen inches or less in width that are devoid of branches and spaced to minimize visual obstruction are allowed in a sight triangle. Such structures are considered point obstructions and are permitted because a driver can adjust slightly to avoid or see around them. 
2.  Subject to approval by the City Engineer, a traffic signal cabinet may be located in a sight triangle only where no other location is feasible due to physical or fiscal constraints, and is located such that the side facing vehicle traffic is less than eighteen inches (18") in width to minimize the sight obstruction. 
Figure 18.1 Sight Triangle Requirements for Street Intersections 

Distance A and Distance B are measured from the point of intersection of lines that extend from either the edge of the curb line or edge of asphalt, whichever is closer to the property, away from the intersection. Only one of the four required street sight triangles is shown.

5.  All driveway approaches shall comply with the following standards. 
a.  Sidewalk to Be Removed . Where a driveway approach is designed to cross an existing sidewalk, the sidewalk included in the driveway approach area shall be removed and reconstructed as a driveway approach unless the City Engineer has determined that the section of sidewalk fully complies with the requirements of this section for driveway approaches. The area across the driveway will be jointed and edged as a sidewalk. The depth and design for the sidewalk will be consistent with the driveway approved design and will be consistent with ADA regulations. 
b.  Removal of Curb and Gutter . Where a driveway approach is to be constructed at a location where a curb and gutter is in place, the curb and gutter shall be removed to the nearest existing construction joint or a new construction joint formed by other methods as may be approved by the City Engineer. The driveway approach shall be constructed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
c.  Drainage . Driveway approaches shall be designed to prevent the entrance of water from the street onto private property, except that a drainage system may be provided within the property to handle water coming from the street. Driveway approaches and related drainage systems shall be constructed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
d.  Radius . Driveway approaches shall be constructed with either flared side slopes or with return curbs having a rolled face disappearing at the sidewalks and joining the street curb with a radius to conform to the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. Flared side slopes shall be used whenever a curb return may present an architectural barrier within a pedestrian path. Driveway flares shall not extend in front of the adjacent property. The radius shall continue beyond the sidewalk to the end of the required dimension. 
6.  Design Criteria . Driveway widths shall comply with the criteria listed below in Table 18-4.

;ol2; (a)\ Width of Driveway Approach . On local streets the width of any driveway approach shall conform to the dimensions as required by Table 3-6, and the width shall be as measured along the property line, except that driveway approaches for motor vehicle docks, within a building, shall not exceed sixty feet (60') in width at the property line. The width shall be measured to the centerline of the driveway at the property line where the curb return ends. 
(b)  Maximum Space t o Be Occupied By Driveway Approaches . Driveway approaches shall not occupy more than seventy percent (70%) of the roadway abutting frontage of the tract of ground devoted to one particular use. 
(c)  Number of Driveway Approaches Allowed . On local streets not more than one (1) driveway approach shall be permitted on any parcel of property with a frontage of one hundred feet (100') or less, except that additional openings may be permitted with the approval of the City Engineer for the necessity and convenience of the public. For arterials the distances shall be 300 feet. 
(d)  Driveway Separation . When more than one (1) driveway approach is required to serve a parcel of property, the driveway approaches shall be separated by a minimum distance, as measured between the edge of the driveway and the adjacent driveway or street right-of-way, as required by this section. The minimum separation from an arterial or collector intersection shall be 100 feet. 
7.  Single-family and two-family developments are exempt from these standards on all local streets. 
8.  Where a property at a corner does not have the necessary frontage to accommodate the required spacing from the intersection, or an interior property does not have adequate width to meet the spacing requirements from an existing driveway on an adjacent property, a common access easement with an adjacent property may be utilized to obtain the necessary spacing. Where site limitations preclude such common access easements, or where cooperation of adjacent property owners cannot be obtained, the City Engineer may authorize a non-compliant driveway, which should be spaced as far from the intersection as practical, provided that the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed drive would result in a traffic safety hazard. 
9.  Shared Driveways . Driveway approaches shall be located entirely within the frontage of the premises abutting the work, except that shared driveway access with an adjoining property owner may be permitted provided joint application is made by all interested parties and the requirements of section. 
10.  Angle of Driveway Approach . The angle of the driveway approach with the curb line shall be approximately ninety degrees (90) for two-way driveways, or forty-five degrees (45) to ninety degrees (90) for one-way driveways. 
11.  Obstruction of Driveway Approaches . Driveway approaches shall not be constructed or designed so that standing or parked vehicles may obstruct the driveway. 
12.  Cross Access and Internal Driveways . Cross access easements for internal driveways are encouraged to minimize the number of driveway cuts on streets, thereby maintaining street mobility, and to facilitate traffic flow between adjacent lots. 
(a)  May Be Required . A cross access easement(s) for an internal driveway(s) may be required between adjacent lots; 
(b)  Location and Dimension . The location and dimensions of such easement(s) shall be determined by the City Engineer and may be required to be shown on a plat when appropriate. 
Section 18.17 - Sidewalks 
Sidewalks shall be designated, designed and constructed as necessary to comply with all requirements of the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual and the additional standards contained in this UDC. 
A.  Requirement 
Sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all streets throughout the City, except along Interstate Highways 35 and 10. All lots must provide access to a concrete sidewalk. 
B.  Curb Ramps 
Curb ramps shall be provided at all street intersections at the time of construction or reconstruction and shall comply with the provisions in the Federal Register 28, CFR part 36 (Americans with Disabilities Act or ADA) and Texas Accessibility Standards as amended from time to time. 
ADA compliant access shall also be provided to all group, or community, mail boxes. Group mail boxes shall be positioned to allow access to all boxes in the group mailbox to persons who may be in wheelchairs. 
C.  Location and Width 
Where sidewalks are required, they shall be installed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual and shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in width in residential areas and six feet (6') in width in commercial areas. Sidewalks shall be placed parallel to the street for the entire frontage(s) of the lot and shall be located a minimum of two feet (2') behind the curb. 
D.  Sidewalk Obstructions 
Where utility poles, fire plugs or other utility installations occur within the sidewalk width, the walk shall be offset around the obstacle at its full width. If the available right-of-way is insufficient to offset the walk, the City Engineer must approve the solution to the problem. Either additional right-of-way must be dedicated to accommodate the sidewalk or a "Pedestrian and Sidewalk Easement" must be granted of sufficient width and depth to accommodate the sidewalk. In avoiding obstructions, the sidewalk design shall be required to comply with all ADA requirements. 
E.  Curbside Landscaping 
Landscaping in the section of street right-of-way between the curb and sidewalk shall be limited to those "approved" grasses, groundcovers, annuals or perennials listed in Article 18 of this UDC. The use of mulch as a ground cover is also acceptable. All other plants, decorative gravel or stone, or other structural landscaping elements are acceptable alternatives. 
F.  Timing of Construction 
Sidewalks shall generally be installed concurrently with the construction of the primary structure on a lot, except on primary or secondary arterials, where they shall be installed concurrently with the street. For new single-family residential development, this requirement may be deferred until the issuance of building permits. 
G.  Construction Concurrent with Street Construction 
If a street is constructed which has no residential lot access, sidewalks must be installed concurrently with street construction. 
H.  At the time that that Final Acceptance is granted for any subdivision, or any unit or phase of a subdivision, the City shall require the developer to file a Sidewalk Installation Bond equal to valuation of sidewalks that are required to be installed by this UDC but that have not yet been constructed. The City shall release the Sidewalk Installation Bond at such time as all required sidewalks are constructed. 
I.  Corner Lot 
Where sidewalks are installed on corner lots, sidewalks shall be installed along both street frontages and shall be extended to the curb with handicapped access ramps in accordance with ADA and TAS standards. 
J.  Waiver or Deferment of Sidewalk Installation 
The City Engineer may recommend that the installation of certain sidewalk sections be deferred to a future date when topographic or other unique conditions exist that may preclude the immediate construction of a sidewalk. In those instances, the City Council may accept the City Engineer recommendation to defer the installation of such a sidewalk to a time deemed more appropriate. In the event that the installation of sidewalks is deferred, the developer shall provide a subdivision improvement agreement guaranteeing the installation of a deferred sidewalk. 
K.  Retrofitted and Reconstructed Sidewalks 
1.  The policy of the City is that continuous pedestrian sidewalks are important public infrastructure and that sidewalks should ordinarily be installed and maintained on both sides of every block of every City-maintained street, with exception as provided below. 
2.  Except as specifically authorized by the City Council, significant projects involving the construction and reconstruction of public sidewalks should be included in the annual Capital Improvement Plan. Funds to construct minor projects and perform general repairs of sidewalks may be allocated in the annual budget process. 
3.  Prior to installation of a new sidewalk on any street(s), at least 30 days' written notice shall be given to all adjacent property titleholders on both sides of the street and a public meeting scheduled to provide opportunity for public to provide comment regarding installation of sidewalk in the subject location(s). This section does not apply to new developments where sidewalks are installed by the developer to meet UDC requirements. 
4.  The City Council may decide by majority vote, based on good reasons including but not limited to the following criteria, to forego installation of sidewalk in a particular location if: 
a.  A majority of the title-holders of properties on the block(s) attest by their signatures on a petition to be received by the City Secretary by the time of the public meeting that they are opposed to the installation of sidewalk on their block. This criterion must be accompanied by at least one of the following circumstances: 
b.  There is insufficient existing public right-of-way or easement available for installation of sidewalk and it is infeasible to either voluntarily acquire the necessary easement or to incorporate part of the existing roadway for the sidewalk. If the curb-to-curb footprint is to change by incorporating part of the existing roadway for the sidewalk addition or with expansion, then City Council's considerations will also take into account the impact on surrounding street traffic patterns; 
c.  The block(s) are not on a through street (must be accompanied by criterion a. above); 
d.  Construction of a sidewalk would present inordinate engineering challenges or costs; 
e.  Construction of a sidewalk would entail the loss of significant tree canopy. 
5.  The City shall make every reasonable effort to find creative solutions to problems cited in Section 4 above before deciding to forego installation of sidewalk. 
6.  The City shall endeavor to remove or minimize obstacles within new or existing sidewalks to the extent possible without incurring significant additional costs. 
7.  The City standard for sidewalk width is five feet and all sidewalks below that width shall ordinarily be reconstructed, where feasible according to criteria described above, to conform to the City standard, with the City Council considering the following exceptions: 
a.  Streets in which City Council has previously approved a different width; 
b.  Blocks identified by the City Council as having special need or special opportunity for wider sidewalks (e.g., blocks with commercial or other high-traffic frontage or where property owners bear all or part of the cost of installation). 
8.  New and reconstructed sidewalks shall comply with all applicable accessibility codes. Every attempt should be made to ensure a buffer between the sidewalk and the curb line of the adjoining street. 
9.  Sidewalk construction and reconstruction should be conducted in conjunction with Pavement Management and street resurfacing projects and also be coordinated with infrastructure development and rehabilitation projects (i.e. water, sewer, drainage projects) to ensure the projects do not conflict. 
10.  Property owners may petition the City Council for installation of sidewalks that exceed those provided for by this policy; however, City Council may require that property owners on the block(s) proposed, if such work is approved, be assessed for the cost of the work. Partial assessment of each property on a block may be required to provide sidewalks were there are unusual costs or difficult engineering requirements. In those instances the City will agree to pay for its share of the costs: work limited to routine sidewalk construction, but not for other required improvements. 
Section 18.18 - Bike Lanes 
It is the policy of the City to require bike lanes along all arterial and collector streets designated on the Future Thoroughfare Plan of the City Street sections for collector and arterial streets shall be designed to incorporate bike lanes designed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
Section 18.19 - Linear Parks 
It is the policy of the City to reserve appropriate spaces that may be interconnected into a linear park network. The City Council may require that any drainage or utility easement that provides a connection or connections to adjoining neighborhoods or an existing or proposed linear park network also be designated as a public access easement for the purpose of providing pedestrian and bicycle access and may request parkland dedication for this purpose in accordance with this UDC. Linear parks, when proposed or where required, must be designed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual.

B.  Utility Location Policies 
1.  It shall be the policy of the City Council to require that all developments located within the City to request City water and sanitary sewer service. Should a development be located in the CCN boundaries of another utility purveyor, the applicant shall invoke applicable state statutes, as amended, and formally request that the City provide utility service(s). The City shall determine if the City can provide the requested utility service(s) to the development. 
2.  It is in the City's best interest to coordinate and regulate the placement of public and private utilities in the public right-of-way and in easements on private property. Such regulations and coordination shall be managed under the general guidelines of this UDC. 
3.  Utilities are to be placed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
4.  The subdivider shall be responsible for insuring that utility providers are given a coordinated schedule for the installation of respective facilities, including sufficient notice of desired installation dates. Prior to the start of curb and pavement installation, the subdivider shall obtain a written release from each utility provider indicating that required utility installation is complete, or shall ensure that subsequent installation of these utilities is performed in a manner that does not cut or otherwise damage newly constructed streets that will be dedicated to the public. 
5.  The subdivider shall be responsible for providing the City Planner with adequate information to show the exact locations of all utilities installed. No public facilities or improvements shall be accepted for dedication until such as built plans or record drawings, as required herein. 
6.  In those instances where existing utilities in easements on private property need to be replaced, such utilities shall be relocated within nearby public rights-of-way in accordance with the location criteria of this UDC and Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
7.  There shall be sufficient right-of-way along local and collector streets for utilities and solid waste pick-up, except where alleys or other easements allow for these services to be located off-street. 
8.  There shall be sufficient right-of-way such that sidewalks and related pedestrian activity is not impeded by the location of utilities, including solid waste pick-up, fire hydrants, and utility poles. 
9.  In those instances where unusual circumstances arise, not specifically covered by foregoing provisions and/or referenced location criteria, the general intent of this UDC shall be used to guide the placement of utility facilities. 
10.  In accordance with Article 18 of this UDC, it is the policy of the City to reserve appropriate spaces that may be interconnected into a linear park network. The City Council may require that any drainage or utility easement that provides a connection or connections to adjoining neighborhoods or an existing or proposed linear park network also be designated as a public access easement for the purpose of providing pedestrian and bicycle access and may request parkland dedication for this purpose in accordance with this UDC. Linear parks, when proposed or where required, must be designed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
C.  Roughly Proportional Responsibilities of Developer 
The subdivider shall be responsible for the cost of all design, engineering, labor, and construction costs that are roughly proportional to the utility and drainage improvements required by this UDC, except to the extent that this section specifically provides for full or partial payment by the City. The provisions of this section shall apply to resubdivisions as well as to subdivisions. Specifically, the developer shall be responsible for the rough proportional costs of the following: 
1.  Phasing of development or improvements in order to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities; 
2.  Extensions of public facilities and roadways, including any necessary on- and off-site facilities, to connect to existing public facilities; 
3.  Providing and/or procuring all necessary property interests, including rights-of-way and easements, for the facilities (whether on-site or off-site); 
4.  Providing proof to the City of adequate public facilities; 
5.  Making provisions for future expansion of the public facilities as needed to serve future developments, subject to the City's oversize participation policies, if applicable; 
6.  Providing for all operations and maintenance of the public facilities, or providing proof that a separate entity will be responsible for the operations and maintenance of the facilities; 
7.  Providing fiscal security required for the construction of the public facilities; 
8.  Obtaining approvals from the applicable utility providers other than the City; and 
9.  Complying with all requirements of the utility providers, including the City and applicable drainage districts.

D.  Roughly Proportional Developer Responsibilities for Off-Site Utility/Drainage Improvements 
Where a subdivision is adjacent to or is served by utility and/or drainage facilities that do not meet the City's minimum standards for utility and/or drainage design or construction, the subdivider shall make the improvements to the substandard facilities as are roughly proportional to the utility and drainage impacts generated by the subdivision. Said improvements shall be established through the completion of a Utility and/or Drainage Impact Analysis that meets the minimum standards specified in this Article. The City may, at its discretion, participate in the costs to oversize the improvements with the subdivider as set out herein and subject to the City's participation policies regarding oversizing improvements. 
E.  Necessity for Easement Dedication and Construction 
1.  Support for New Development 
a.  New development must be supported by adequate levels of public facilities and services, as required and defined herein, and as limited by Section 19.6.C. 
b.  It is necessary and desirable to provide for dedication of rights-of-way and easements for capital improvements, as limited by Section 19.6.C herein, to support new development at the earliest stage of the development process. 
2.  Developer Obligations; Dedication and Construction of Improvements 
The developer shall dedicate all rights-of-way and easements for capital improvements within the rights-of-way or easements for those water, wastewater, road or drainage improvements needed to adequately serve a proposed development consistent with the applicable master facilities plans and construction design standards, as limited in Section 19.6.C, and shall construct said improvements, whether the facilities are located on, adjacent to or outside the boundaries of the property being developed in accordance with this UDC. 
3.  Timing of Dedication and Construction 
a.  Initial Provision for Dedication or Construction . The City shall require an initial demonstration that a proposed development shall be adequately served by public facilities and services, as limited in Section 19.6.C, at the time for approval of the first development application that portrays a specific plan of development, including but not limited to a petition for establishing a Planned Development (PD) zoning district, or other overlay zoning district; a petition for an annexation agreement or a development agreement; an application for a Land Study, or an application for a Preliminary Plat or Final Plat. As a condition of approval of the development application, the City may require provision for dedication of rights-of-way or easements for, and construction of, capital improvements to serve the proposed development. 
b.  Deferral of Obligation . The obligation to dedicate easements or rights-of-way for or to construct one or more capital utility or drainage improvement to serve a new development may be deferred until approval of a subordinate development permit, or, in the case of a development proposed to be developed in phases, until a subsequent phase of the development, on the sole discretion of the City, upon written request of the property owner, or at the City s own initiative. As a condition of deferring the obligation, the City may require that the developer enter into a capital improvements agreement pursuant to Article 20 of this UDC, specifying the time for dedication of easement or rights-of-way for or construction of capital improvements serving the development. 
c.  Relief from Obligations . In order to achieve proportionality between the demands created by a proposed development on public facilities and the obligation to provide adequate public facilities, as limited in Section 19.6.C, the City may participate in the costs of public facilities in accordance with this Article or relieve the property owner of some or part of the obligations in response to a petition the City Manager for relief from a dedication or construction requirements. Petitions seeking relief that are denied by the City Manager may be appealed to the City Council. 
4.  Utility/Drainage Participation Policies - Improvement to Adjacent Utilities and Drains 
a.  Improvement of Fair Share of Substandard Utility and Drainage Facilities . When an area within a proposed plat, whether residential or nonresidential, abuts on one or both sides of an existing substandard, or non-existent, utility and/or drainage facility, or a planned or future utility or drainage facility as shown on the City's adopted plans or capital improvements program related to water, wastewater and/or stormwater, the developer shall be required to improve its roughly proportional share of the utility and/or storm drainage facilities and water quality or erosion controls, and utility facilities, to bring the facilities to City standards, or to replace them with standard City utility or drainage facilities at no cost to the City. 
b.  Calculation Cost . 
i.  The developer's share of improvements to a substandard utility or drainage facility shall be the complete cost required to design and construct the utility or drainage facility to a level of service that complies with the standards and requirements of this UDC to adequately serve the proposed development. 
ii.  The City may participate in the costs of improvements in excess of the developer's fair share obligations and where such costs are not borne by another public entity, in cases where the application of the standards in this Section result in a developer paying more than their roughly proportional share of the cost, as determined in accordance by a City retained engineer or when the oversizing of required utility or drainage improvements is determined to be in the interest of the public to address health or safety issues or to complete public improvements to a level of service identified in the capital improvements program or an approved plan or study. 
5.  Improvements . All required utility and drainage improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
F.  Utility Easements 
Utility easements shall be provided for the installation of utilities in accordance with the requirements of the City and any utility provider.

c.  Private Drainage Facilities . Roof drains, building drains, and parking lot drainageways may be located outside dedicated drainageways. 
H.  Alternative Design Standards 
a.  Purpose . It is the purpose of this section to provide for the consideration of detention and drainage facility designs which differ from the conventional design standards as outlined within this UDC, but which are based upon sound engineering judgment. Such alternative(s) shall meet the purpose and intent of the standard being varied. In this context, detention and drainage facilities shall mean physical improvements such as detention ponds, retention ponds, drainage swales, as well as any other infrastructure element of a proposed development. Land Development Code Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations Article 2: Subdivision Standards 
b.  Approval Based on Engineering . Decisions regarding design of such physical improvements in a subdivision should be based on engineering studies. Thus, while this UDC provides standards for design, the regulations are not a substitute for sound engineering judgment. Therefore, a licensed engineer may submit alternative designs to be reviewed and considered by the City Engineer, including the option of providing a downstream assessment. 
c.  Relationship to UDC/Cibolo Design and Construction Manual . If the proposed alternative design is approved by the City Engineer, then the all other applicable provisions of this UDC and the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual shall be deemed to have been met. If the proposed alternative design standards are not approved by the City Engineer, then the standards contained this UDC and the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual shall apply. 
d.  Appeals to the Planning and Zoning Commission . If a proposed alternative design is rejected by the City Engineer, the subdivider may appeal the decision to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
I.  Construction Sequencing and Erosion Controls

6.  10-, 25- and 100-year flood flow quantities with the 10-, 25- and 100-year flood plain limits for the existing and fully developed watershed shown on the preliminary plat. 
7.  Preliminary street grades sufficient to determine high points, low points, and direction of runoff flows. 
8.  Proposed locations of inlets, storm sewers and culverts. 
9.  Proposed routing of drainage ways. 
10.  All proposed drainage easements, including width of easement and configuration of channel. 
11.  The calculations to determine the volume of proposed detention/retention/sedimentation ponds. 
12.  Roads, measured curb to curb, shall be designed for 10-year storm event, and right-of-way to right-of-way for a 25-year storm event. Underground drainage facilities and all above ground channels shall be designed to a full-flow 25-year storm event. Regional stormwater pond and the 100-year floodplain shall be designed to 100-year storm events. Stormwater designs shall ensure proper conveyance of the 1% annual storm event. 
The above information shall be supplemented with narrative text describing the watershed and the subdivision, including their general soil conditions, downstream channel conditions, all weather access, and the presence of special flood hazard areas within the subdivision. The study shall be prepared by a professional engineer registered in the State of Texas. The drainage study shall be submitted along with the preliminary plat. The City Engineer shall review the submission and verify that all UDC requirements have been met. 
h.  Downstream Drainage Assessment . Downstream drainage assessment shall extend from the outfall of the subdivision to a point downstream, determined by one of two methods: 
  Zone of Influence - Point downstream where the discharge from a proposed development no longer has a significant impact upon the receiving stream or storm drainage system 
  Adequate Outfall - Location of acceptable outfall that does not create adverse flooding or erosion conditions downstream 
These methods recognize the fact that a structural control providing detention has a "zone of influence" downstream where its effectiveness can be felt. Beyond this zone of influence the stormwater effects of a structural control become relatively small and insignificant compared to the runoff from the total drainage area at that point. Based on studies and master planning results for a large number of sites, a general rule of thumb is that the zone of influence can be considered to be the point where the drainage area controlled by the detention or storage facility comprises 10% of the total drainage area. This is known as the 10% Rule. As an example, if a structural control drains 10 acres, the zone of influence ends at the point where the total drainage area is 100 acres or greater. 
The downstream assessment shall include the following steps: 
1.  Determine the outfall location of the site and the pre- and post-development site conditions. 
2.  Using a topographic map, determine a preliminary lower limit of the zone of influence using the 10% Rule. 
3.  Using a hydrologic model determine the pre-development peak flows and velocities at each junction beginning at the development outfall and ending at the next junction beyond the preliminary lower limit of the zone of influence (10% point). Model all undeveloped off-site areas as "fully built-out" for both the pre- and post-development analyses. Use the City Future Land Use Map to determine future land uses for the model. Evaluate discharges and velocities for the 10-year, 25-year and 100-year storm events. Use storm durations equal to 24-hours and two times the time of concentration calculated for the outfall of the subdivision. 
4.  Change the land use on the subdivision site to post-development conditions and rerun the model. 
5.  Compare the pre- and post-development peak discharges and velocities at the downstream end of the model. If the post-developed flows are higher than the pre-developed flows for the same frequency event, or the post-developed velocities are higher than the allowable velocity of the downstream receiving system, extend the model downstream. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the post-development flows are less than the pre-developed flows, and the post-developed velocities are below the allowable velocity. Allowable velocities are provided in the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
6.  Add proposed stormwater management facilities to the model designed so that the model shows that adverse effects are mitigated. Adverse effects can be shown to be mitigated if flooding is not increased, velocities do not exceed the greater of allowable maximum velocities or pre-development velocities, and that the peak flow at the downstream limit of the zone of influence is not increased. 
M.  Drainage Easements 
1.  General Requirements 
Natural waterways and channels should be used wherever practical to carry runoff. Any modifications to existing waterways and channels must be approved by the City Engineer. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, natural channel or stream, an easement or right-of-way shall be provided conforming substantially to the 100-year floodway or channel limits of such watercourse, plus additional width to accommodate future needs. 
2.  Enclosed Systems 
Storm drainage easements shall be provided for existing and proposed enclosed drainage systems. Easements shall be centered on the systems. The easement width shall have a minimum width of ten feet. Additional drainage easement width may be required based on the formula: W = 5' + 2H + D 
(W = Easement Width; H = Depth of Soil Over Pipe/Box; D = Diameter/Width of Pipe/Box) 
3.  Open Channels 
Storm drainage easements along proposed or existing open channels shall provide sufficient width for the required channel and such additional width as may be required to provide ingress and egress of maintenance equipment; to provide clearance from fences and space for utility poles; to allow maintenance of the channel bank; and to provide adequate slopes necessary along the bank. 
The minimum easement width shall be the width of the channel plus 15 feet on one side (20 feet with utilities) and 2 feet on the opposite side unless approved by the City. The channel top width is determined by the locations where the channel side slopes intersect with adjacent grade with cross slopes less than 10 percent. 
4.  Overflow Drainage 
Storm drainage easements shall be provided for emergency overflow drainage ways of sufficient width to contain within the easement stormwater resulting from a 100-year frequency storm less the amount of stormwater carried in an enclosed system. 
N.  Flood Hazards 
1.  General Policy. 
All subdivisions shall conform to the "Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973," Public Law 93-234, and the latest revisions thereof. Development shall adhere to all policies and requirements of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Chapter 30 "Flooding" of the City Code of Ordinances. 
2.  Flood Plain Designations and General Restrictions. 
Federal flood plains are based on a 1% annual occurrence frequency discharge, and apply only in those areas where official Federal Emergency Management Agency maps have been prepared, or where a 1% annual occurrence water and surface profile studies are available for the City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted in an area having special flood hazards as defined by Chapter 30 of the City Code of Ordinances, this UDC and the Cibolo Drainage and Construction Manual unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not substantially increase the water surface elevation of the a 1% annual occurrence flood at any point within the City's subdivision jurisdiction. 
3.  Flood Hazards to Water and Wastewater Systems. 
New or replacement water supply systems and/or wastewater systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding. 
O.  Green Space Preservation 
1.  Purpose and Definitions 
The purpose of this section is to establish minimal acceptable requirements for the design of buffers to protect the streams, wetlands and floodplains of Cibolo, Texas; to protect the water courses, reservoirs, lakes and other significant water resources in Cibolo; to protect Cibolo's riparian and aquatic ecosystems; and to provide for the environmentally sound land use. 
The following definitions shall be used to define the terminology described in this "Green Space Preservation" section: 
Best Management Practices or BMP - refers to schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the United States. BMP's also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage. 
Environmentally Sensitive Area - Any area wherein plant or animal life, listed in the Texas Endangered Species Act and/or the Federal Endangered Species Act, exists or there is evidence of their inhabitance. 
Erosion - refers to the wearing away of land by the action of wind, water, gravity, ice or any combination of these forces. 
First Order Stream - No defined tributaries drain into this stream and it normally originates from springs, seeps or rain runoff from the higher elevations in a watershed and conducts water into a higher order stream. First order streams appear on a USGS 1:24,000 Topographical Map. 
Fourth Order Stream - is a stream formed by the confluence of two third order streams. 
Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM) - shall mean "that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas," as defined in 33 CFR Part 328 Definition of Waters of the United States- Section 328.3 e. 
Second Order Stream - is a stream formed by the confluence of two first order streams. 
Stream Order - is a classification system for streams based on stream hierarchy, with the smallest stream having the lowest numerical classification. 
Streams - are identified on U.S. Geological Survey (1:24,000) maps. 
Stream System - means a stream channel of a given order together with one or more of the following: 1) 100-year floodplain; 2) Hydrologically related wetland; 3) Reservoir receiving water from one or more streams. 
Third Order Stream - is a stream formed by the confluence of two second order streams. 
Vegetative Buffer - A vegetated area, including trees, shrubs, and herbaceous vegetation, that exists or is established to protect a stream system. A vegetative buffer for a stream system generally consists of a strip of land, with native vegetation, along both sides of a stream system.

Management includes specific limitations on alteration of the natural conditions of these resources. The following practices and activities are restricted within the vegetative buffer: 
1.  Clearing of any existing vegetation; 
2.  Soil disturbance by grading, stripping, or other practices; 
3.  Filling or dumping; 
4.  Use, storage, or application of herbicides. 
b.  The following structures, practices, and activities are permitted in the vegetative buffer, with specific design or maintenance features: 
1.  Roads, bridges, sidewalks, and utilities 
a.  These facilities may be constructed if such are required by the City; access to the property would be hindered or compromised because of the property's location; or if conditions specific to the land require it. In any of these instances, the P&E Director or his/her designee may administratively grant approval or deny the request for the construction of said structure(s). In the event of denial by the Planning and Engineering Director or his/her designee, the issue may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission, whose decision shall be final. 
b.  The right-of-way should be the minimum width needed to allow for maintenance access and installation. 
c.  The angle of the crossing shall be as near to perpendicular as allowed by the P&E Director or his/her designee. In the event of denial by the P&E Director the issue may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, whose decision shall be final. 
d.  Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of road crossings within each subdivision and no more than one road crossing is allowed for every 1,200 feet of buffer. 
2.  Stormwater Management 
a.  These facilities may be constructed, if such are required by the City for flood control or to improve water quality or habitat in the stream. In any of these instances, an applicant may request a waiver of the standards for Planning and Zoning review and City Council approval. A waiver may only be granted if the proposed "alternate stormwater design solution" is consistent the spirit and intent of this UDC and consistent with generally accepted engineering practices. 
b.  When constructing stormwater management facilities, "best management practices" shall be observed. The area cleared will be limited to the area required for construction and adequate maintenance access as required in this UDC and the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
c.  Material dredged or otherwise removed during construction or subsequent maintenance from a stormwater management facility shall be stored outside the buffer. 
3.  Stream restoration projects approved by the P&E Director or his/her designee are permitted within the vegetative buffer. 
4.  Water quality monitoring and stream gauging are permitted within the vegetative buffer as approved by the P&E Director or his/her designee. 
5.  Individual trees within the buffer that are in danger of falling, causing damage to dwellings or other structures, or causing blockage of the stream, may be removed. Other tree cutting techniques approved by the P&E Director or his/her designee may be undertaken within the vegetative buffer under the advice and guidance of the Planning and Zoning Commission, if necessary to preserve the riparian forest from extensive pest infestation and disease infestation. 
6.  Selective clearing for health and safety purposes is allowed as determined by P&E Director or his/her designee. 
c.  The Final Plat and all right-of-way plans shall clearly show the extent of any vegetative buffer on the subject property. 
d.  All protected vegetative buffer areas and stream systems shall run with the land and continue in perpetuity. Protected vegetative buffer areas and stream systems may be dedicated to the public by separate instrument, which must be submitted to the City Engineer and P&E Director or his/her designee for approval and recorded in the land records, or by a Final Plat. If the owner property desires to keep the stream system and buffer as an amenity, there shall be a covenant, to be submitted to the City Engineer and CDS Director, for approval and recorded in the land records, that restricts the use of the stream system and buffer to uses set forth herein, and specifies that the owner, or an owner designee, must ensure that the stream system and buffer is maintained by the owner, his heirs successors and assigns for so long as the stream system and buffer remains in private ownership. 
e.  The P&E Director or his/her designee and City Engineer shall inspect the buffer annually and immediately following severe storms for evidence of sediment deposition, erosion, or concentrated flow channels. Corrective actions shall be taken to ensure the integrity and functions of the vegetative buffer. 
f.  The City will maintain all vegetative buffer and stream systems that are created pursuant to this section which have been dedicated to the public. 
g.  Weeds and grass shall be maintained by the property owner, HOA, or Property Owner Association on which the easement is located in accordance the City Code of Ordinances provisions for high weeds and grass. 
9.  Linear Parks 
It is the policy of the City to reserve appropriate spaces that may be interconnected into a linear park network. The City Council may require that any drainage or utility easement that provides a connection or connections to adjoining neighborhoods or an existing or proposed linear park network also be designated as a public access easement for the purpose of providing pedestrian and bicycle access and may request parkland dedication for this purpose in accordance with this UDC. Linear parks, when provided, must be designed in accordance with the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
10.  Incentives 
a.  If buffer widths on first and second order streams are strictly adhered to, the conservation plan requirement shall be waived. 
b.  Credit shall be given as determined by the P&E Director or his/her designee for the development of Linear Parks around natural drainage and wooded areas that provide potential recreational uses. Criteria for flood plain areas (based upon a hundred-year flood plain) that is dedicated as parkland, will be given credit as determined by the P&E Director or his/her designee by meeting the following requirements: 
1.  Flood plain and natural drainage area shall generally not exceed 60% of total park site. 
2.  At least 50% of required dedicated parkland shall have slopes in the range of 2% and not to exceed 5%, well-drained and suitable for active use. 
3.  Additional flood plain acreage over 75% of required parkland may be dedicated at a (3:1) ratio in acres in lieu of non flood plain property and any such consideration of acreage shall be at the discretion of the Planning Director in compliance with the Parks and Open Space Comprehensive Master Plan. 
4.  The P&E Director or his/her designee shall determine whether land offered for dedication complies with the standards for dedication as provided in the Cibolo Master Parks Plan and Comprehensive Master Plan. 
c.  Stormwater discharges into large creeks 
1.  For development adjacent to the main stem of Cibolo, Dietz, Town Creek East, Town Creek West, Town Creek or Santa Clara Creeks, stormwater discharge may not require detention facilities, provided that the engineer is able to demonstrate that the increased direct discharge will not result in any adverse impacts to any downstream or adjacent property, and provided that there is compliance with the City Code of Ordinances Chapter 30 (Floods) and all other aspects of this UDC and Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
d.  On-site detention within the plat boundaries of a residential subdivision 
1.  For detention ponds in residential developments voluntarily created to enhance the protection of 1 st and 2 nd order streams, the required private maintenance shall extend to the warranty period as provided by other ordinances. 
2.  When a first or second order stream within development is voluntarily protected, a R.O.W. section may be similarly modified as provided herein. 
e.  Commercial subdivisions distributed detention 
1.  Distributed detention on commercial subdivisions where streams are to be voluntarily protected shall be allowed, deferring the construction of required stormwater detention facilities to the building permit (construction) phase, so long as the deferral is approved at final platting and covered by a note on the face of the plat. 
2.  In cases where a development includes a protected stream system, the required detention volume may be distributed over the site provided the plat is annotated with a note indicating the "Q" (volumetric discharge) of each lot. 
3.  The required private maintenance period for off-line detention facilities shall extend to the warranty period. Warranties shall remain in effect as provided by this UDC. 
4.  For developments where all lots are at least one acre in area, minimum storage requirements for detention and the maximum discharge rate requirement shall be included on the plat for each lot, specifying the requirement for each lot to individually meet the requirements of this UDC and the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual during the building permit process. A General Note approved by the P&E Director or his/her designee that specifies these requirements shall be included on the face of the plat. Calculations for said lot storage volumes and discharge rates shall be approved by the City Engineer in conjunction with their review of the improvement plans for the development during the platting process. 
f.  Park credit transferability 
1.  Voluntary protection of first and second order streams entitle the owner to a park credit for the stream system protected and its surrounding buffer on an equivalent square footage basis. If the following criteria are met: 
a.  Flood plain and natural drainage area shall generally not exceed 75% of the site;

Section 19.10 - Political Subdivisions to Supply Water, Sewer, Roadways or Drainage Facilities in the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction 
A.  General 
1.  The formation of a political subdivision for the intended purpose of supplying fresh water for domestic or commercial use, or to furnish sanitary sewer services, roadways, or drainage facilities, may not be created in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City unless the City Council gives its written consent by ordinance or resolution in accordance with Section 42.042, 42.0425 and 42.043 of the Texas Local Government Code and the Texas Water Code. In giving its consent, the City Council may not place any conditions or other restrictions on the creation of the political subdivision other than those expressly permitted by Section 54.016(e), Water Code. 
2.  If the City Council fails or refuses to give its consent for the creation of the political subdivision on mutually agreeable terms within 90 days after the date it receives a written request for the consent, a majority of the qualified voters of the area of the proposed political subdivision and the owners of at least 50 percent of the land in the proposed political subdivision may petition the governing body to make available to the area the water, sanitary sewer services, or both that would be provided by the political subdivision. 
3.  If, within 120 days after the date the governing body receives the petition, the governing body fails to make a contract with a majority of the qualified voters of the area of the proposed political subdivision and the owners of at least 50 percent of the land in the proposed political subdivision to provide the services, that failure constitutes the governing body's consent to the creation of the proposed political subdivision. 
4.  City Council consent to the creation of the political subdivision is only an authorization to initiate proceedings to create the political subdivision as provided by law. 
5.  If the City Council fails or refuses to give its consent to the creation of the political subdivision or fails or refuses to execute a contract providing for the water or sanitary sewer services requested within the time limits prescribed by this section, the applicant may petition the TCEQ for the creation of the political subdivision or the inclusion of the land in a political subdivision. 
B.  TCEQ and Guadalupe County Approvals Required 
For water and sanitary sewer systems provided by a non-City political subdivision, as described above, the following requirements shall apply: 
1.  At time of preliminary platting the applicant shall provide the City with a letter of approval from the TCEQ certifying that the water or sanitary sewer system serving the development is in compliance with the rules and regulations of the TCEQ and that the public water or sanitary sewer system provider holds a current valid Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) for the area proposed for development. The letter of approval from the TCEQ shall be accompanied by a map delineating the boundaries of the CCN in the vicinity of the development. 
2.  For a development in the ETJ where the water system will not be integrated into the City water system, the developer must: 
a.  Submit with the Preliminary Plat application a current letter from the TCEQ certifying that the public water system that will serve the subdivision is in compliance with TCEQ rules and regulations. 
b.  Submit Construction Plans and specifications for the subdivision's water system for City approval demonstrating that the water system will be built to the standards of this UDC and the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual to serve the subdivision. 
c.  If a water system cannot meet the standards of this section, the City Council, at its discretion, may approve the plat if arrangements, such as a developer's agreement, are made to provide an approved water system that meet City standards to serve the subdivision upon annexation by the City. This shall be arranged by means of a mutually acceptable contract with the City, unless a contract with another entity ensures compliance with the technical requirements of this chapter, as determined by the City Attorney. 
3.  For developments in the ETJ, the developer shall obtain approval and signature of the appropriate Guadalupe County health official on the water or sewer system statement as shown on the Development plat prior to P&E Director approval or in the case of a PP/FP Development Plat the Planning and Zoning Commission approval. The water system statement as shown on the plat shall indicate that the development will be served by a water system meeting City standards, as stated herein and the applicable standards of the water or sewer purveyor. 
4.  Plans and specifications for all water systems to serve the development shall be submitted as part of the subdivision construction plans submitted to the City for review and approval. 
Section 19.11 - Fill 
A.  Identification of Existing/Proposed Fill during Platting 
Fill is frequently a factor in the construction of public improvements and foundation construction. Fill may be placed on a site at various times. As a requirement of the platting process, construction plans shall be submitted that clearly indicate which lots will be filled and which lots have existing fill. The type(s) of existing fill and proposed fill shall be identified on all Preliminary and Final Plats. Construction plans shall propose and develop a strategy for dealing with fills early on in the construction process. 
B.  Geotechnical Report Required for All Lots and Development 
Fill may exist between borings or be undetected during the geotechnical investigation. The investigation is more accurate if borings are more closely spaced. Consequently, a Geotechnical Report prepared by a Professional Engineer licensed by the State of Texas and qualified to practice geotechnical engineering, shall be required for every building lot, including single-family residential. For residential development, foundations shall be designed in accordance with Recommended Practice for the Design of Residential Foundations, Version 2, as may be amended, by the Texas Section American Society of Civil Engineers, and in accordance with the City Building Code, as may be amended. 
C.  Requirements for Fill Type 
Fill is generally can be divided into three types: engineered fill, forming fill, and uncontrolled fill. These three types, and requirement of the City for each, is described below. 
1.  Engineered Fill 
Engineered fill is designed by an engineer to act as a structural element of a constructed work and is placed under engineering inspection, with density testing. Engineered fill may be embankment fill, composed of the material randomly found on the site, or imported to no particular specification, other than that it be free of debris and trash or may be select fill. Embankment fill can be used many situations if it is properly placed and compacted. The term "select" simply means that the material meets some specification as to gradation and P.I., and possibly some other material specifications. 
If engineered fill is proposed, a fill report shall be submitted for City Engineer approval addressing the following: 
1.  Fill Composition Report and Fill Design Specifications. 
2.  Proposed Density Inspection and Testing Schedule. 
3.  Fill Compaction Detail showing lift depths and proposed densities. 
4.  Gradation requirements. 
5.  Underslab details, if applicable. 
6.  List requirements for fill placement, geometry, material, compaction and quality control. 
2.  Forming Fill 
Forming fill is that which is typically used under residential foundation slabs and is variously known as sandy loam, river loam or fill dirt. Forming fill is normally not expected to be heavily compacted, and a designer should not rely on this material for support. The only requirements are that this material be non-expansive, clean, and that it works easily and stands when cut. If forming fill happened to be properly compacted and inspected in accordance with an engineering specification it could be engineered fill. 
3.  Uncontrolled Fill 
Uncontrolled fill is fill that has been determined to be unsuitable (or has not been proven suitable) to support a slab-on-ground foundation. Any fill that has not been approved by a qualified geotechnical engineer in writing shall be considered uncontrolled fill. Uncontrolled fill may contain undesirable materials and/or has not been placed under compaction control. Some problems resulting from uncontrolled fill include gradual settlement, sudden collapse, attraction of wood ants and termites, corrosion of metallic plumbing pipes, and in some rare cases, site contamination with toxic or hazardous wastes. 
D.  Building on Non-Engineered Fill (Forming or Uncontrolled) 
Foundations shall not be supported by non-engineered fill . To establish soil supported foundations on non-engineered fill, the typical grid beam stiffened slab foundation is required to penetrate the non-engineered fill with the perimeter and interior beam bottoms forming footings. Penetration will take the load supporting elements of the foundation below the unreliable fill. Penetration could be accomplished by deepened beams, spread footings or piers depending on the depth and the economics of the situation. Generally, piers are most cost effective once the fill to be penetrated exceeds about three feet, but this depends on the foundation engineer's judgment and local practice. Floor systems shall be designed to span between structurally supported foundation elements. 
Pre-existing fill may be classified as engineered fill after investigation by the geotechnical engineer. The approval may depend on the fill thickness, existence of trash and debris, the age of the fill, and the results of testing and proof rolling. The geotechnical engineer must be able to expressly state after investigation that the fill is capable of supporting a residential slab-on-ground foundation.

If the appeal involves technical design and/or construction standards, then the appeal shall be supported and accompanied by appropriate studies and data that support the appeal, which shall be prepared by an appropriate professional expert who is knowledgeable in the subject matter of the appeal. The City Council, at its discretion, shall have the right to have the supporting studies and data reviewed and evaluated by either appropriate City staff officials or by retained outside consulting experts, as the City Council deems appropriate the fees for which may be charged to the appellant. Each appeal shall be decided within sixty (60) days following receipt of the complete appeal request (including any necessary supporting studies and data) from the applicant. 
b.  If an appeal of an administrative decision is submitted with a subdivision Land Study (Master Plan) or plat, no application for appeal shall be considered unless the applicant waives in writing the requirement that a decision on the plan or plat be made within thirty (30) days of application. 
20.1.13  Appeal for Relief from Apportionment of Municipal Infrastructure Costs . 
a.  Purpose and applicability. 
1.  Purpose . The purpose of an appeal for relief from a dedication, reservation, construction, payment of fees, or payment of construction cost requirement is to assure that the application of uniform apportionment of municipal infrastructure costs to a proposed Master Plan or plat is roughly proportionate to the proposed development, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed development on municipal infrastructure. 
2.  Applicability . An appeal for relief under this Article may be filed only to contest the roughly proportionate nature of any apportionment that is imposed under this Article to a Master Plan or plat application or to any other development application authorized under this UDC, whether the requirement is pursuant to uniform standards, or attached as a condition to approval of the application. It is the developer's responsibility to determine the burden of proof of roughly proportionate. An appeal under this Article shall not be used to seek variation from a standard on grounds applicable to a petition for a waiver under this Article. Relief under this provision may not be sought for a recorded plat. 
3.  Effect . If the relief requested under the petition is granted in whole or in part by the City Council, the requirement initially imposed shall be modified accordingly, and the standards applied or the conditions attached to initial approval of the application shall be thereafter applied in accordance with the relief granted and the property owner will not be required to resubmit the application in order to get the benefit of the relief granted. 
b.  Appeal procedures. 
1.  Roughly proportionate analysis . If an applicant for Master Plan or plat approval disagrees with the roughly proportionate nature of the apportionment at any time in the Master Plan's or plat's review process, he should so advise the City in writing no later than two weeks before such Master Plan or plat would be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The City Engineer or other professional engineer retained by the City shall prepare a roughly proportionate analysis prior to consideration of the Master Plan or plat by the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the City Engineer's analysis shows the apportionment of the municipal infrastructure costs to the applicant's development do not exceed the amount that is roughly proportionate to the development's impact and the applicant disagrees with such analysis, the applicant may appeal in accordance with this Article. 
2.  Planning and Zoning Commission Action . The Commission may not approve a Master plan or plat for which an appeal in accordance with this Section has been applied until the City Council has made its decision on the appeal. 
3.  Form of appeal . The appeal for relief from an apportionment requirement shall be in the form of a petition to City Council and allege that application of the standard or the imposition of conditions relating to the Apportionment is not roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed development on municipal infrastructure. The fee for this process shall be as provided for in the Planning and Development Services Fee Schedule, as amended. 
4.  Evidence . The petitioner shall demonstrate that the apportionment requirement that was applied is not roughly proportional to the proposed development's impact on municipal infrastructure. Written evidence presented on behalf of an appellant at any appeal hearing may include evidence that addresses any of the following information that may be pertinent to the circumstances and any other information the appellant deems necessary to the appeal: 
(a)  Total capacity of the particular municipal infrastructure system to be utilized by the proposed development, employing standard measures of capacity and equivalency tables relating the type of development proposed to the quantity of system capacity to be consumed by the development. If the proposed development is to be developed in phases, such information also shall be provided for the entire development proposed, including any phases already developed. 
(b)  Total capacity to be supplied to the particular municipal infrastructure system by the proposed Apportionment. If the development application is part of a phased development, the information may include any capacity supplied by prior Apportionments. 
(c)  Comparison of the capacity of the municipal facilities system(s) to be consumed by the proposed development with the capacity to be supplied to such system(s) by the proposed Apportionment. In making this comparison, the impacts on the municipal infrastructure system(s) from the entire development shall be considered. 
(d)  The effect of any credits against any impact fees due the petitioner as a result of the Apportionment in accordance with City requirements. 
(e)  The effect of any City participation in the costs of over-sizing the capital improvement to be constructed. 
5.  Time for filing petition and study . The petition shall be filed with the City within ninety (90) days of the initial decision on the application. Where the apportionment requirement is applicable to more than one requirement, the petition may be filed following a decision on any application in which the requirement is applied. The study and any evidence in support of the petition shall be filed within ninety (90) days of the date the petition was filed, unless the petitioner seeks an extension in writing. The City Engineer may extend the time for submitting the study or other evidence for a period not to exceed an additional sixty (60) days for good cause shown. 
6.  Land in extraterritorial jurisdiction . Where the subject municipal infrastructure are located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City and are to be dedicated to the County pursuant to an inter-local agreement under Texas Local Government Code Chapter 242, a petition and evidence in support of the petition shall not be accepted as complete for filing by the City Engineer unless the petition or study or other evidence is accompanied by verification that a copy has been delivered to the County. 
c.  Processing of Petitions and Decision. 
1.  Administrative official . The Planning and Development Services Director is the administrative official responsible for processing an Apportionment. Where the petition is for the appeal from an Apportionment in the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction that is to be dedicated to the County pursuant to an inter-local agreement under Texas Local Government Code Chapter 242, the Community Services Director shall coordinate a recommendation with the appropriate County official responsible for reviewing plats in the County. 
The Planning and Development Services Director shall submit the petition to the City Engineer who shall evaluate the petition and supporting study and other evidence, and shall make a recommendation to the City Council based upon the information contained in the study, any comments received from the County, and the appropriate City officials. In evaluating the petition and other evidence, the City Engineer shall take into account the maximum amount of any impact fees to be charged against the development for the type of municipal infrastructure improvement that is the subject of the petition, and any credits due the petitioner against impact fees, as well as any traffic impact, drainage or other adequate facilities studies evaluating the impacts of the development or similar developments on municipal infrastructure. The City Engineer must utilize generally accepted methodology in evaluating the petitioner's study, including but not limited to impact fee methodologies. 
2.  Decision-Maker . The City Council shall decide the appeal for relief based on the criteria set forth in item (d) below. 
3.  Appeal hearing and decision time frames . 
a.  The City Council shall consider the request after an appeal hearing on the subject is held. 
b.  The City Council shall hold the appeal hearing and consider the petition within thirty (30) days of the submission of the study and any other evidence submitted on behalf of the appellant in support of the appeal. 
c.  The City Council shall make a final decision within thirty (30) days following the final submission of any testimony or evidence by the developer at the appeal hearing. 
4.  Decision . The City Council shall consider the petition for relief, the analysis prepared by the City in accordance with this section and the evidence presented, and based upon the criteria set forth in "Criteria for Approval" subsection below, and shall take one of the following actions: 
(a)  Deny the appeal for relief, and impose the standard or condition in accordance with the initial decision; or 
(b)  Deny the appeal for relief, upon finding that the proposed requirements are inadequate to offset the impacts of the development on the municipal infrastructure, and either deny the application or require that additional Apportionments for municipal infrastructure be made as a condition of approval of the application; or 
(c)  Grant the appeal in part and add such conditions of approval to the application as it deems appropriate; or 
(d)  Grant the appeal for relief, and waive in whole or in part any Apportionment requirement necessary to meet the criteria for approval; or 
(e)  Grant the appeal for relief, in whole or in part, and direct that the City participate in the costs of the particular municipal infrastructure. 
5.  Notification of decision on appeal. The petitioner shall be notified in writing of the decision on the appeal for relief by the Planning and Engineering Director within 10 days following the decision. 
d.  Criteria for approval. In deciding the appeal for relief from an Apportionment, the City Council shall determine whether the petitioner has demonstrated that the City Apportionment is not roughly proportional to the proposed development's impact on municipal infrastructure. In making such determination, the City Council shall consider the evidence submitted by the petitioner, the staff's report and recommendation and, where the property is located within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, any recommendations from the County. 
e.  Implementation of appellate decision. 
1.  When appeal for relief is granted . When the City Council grants the appeal for relief, the date of the final decision will be deemed the date of approval of the application, and the City must process the application consistent with the relief granted. 
2.  When appeal for relief is denied . When the City Council denies the appeal for relief, the date of the final decision will be deemed the date of denial of the application, and the petitioner must either withdraw the application or be prepared to make the required Apportionment pursuant to the decision, as appropriate. 
3.  Where approval of the appeal was conditioned . The City may require the applicant to submit modified Master Plans, plats, construction plans, or supporting materials consistent with the relief granted and condition(s) imposed by the City Council on the petition. 
4.  Period of relief . The relief granted on a petition shall remain in effect for the period that the Master Plan or plat approval is in effect, and shall expire upon expiration of the Master Plan or plat approval. Extension of the Master Plan or plat approval also shall result in extension of the relief granted on the petition. 
20.1.14  Payment of all Indebtedness Attributable to a Specific Property . 
No person who owes delinquent taxes, delinquent assessments, delinquent fees, or any other delinquent debts or obligations to the City and that are directly attributable to a piece of property, shall be allowed to file any plat or re-plat until the taxes, assessments, debts or obligations directly attributable to said property and owed by the property owner or a previous owner thereof shall have been first fully discharged by payment, or until an arrangement satisfactory to the City has been made for the payment of such debts or obligations. It shall be the applicant's responsibility to provide evidence or proof that all taxes, assessments, debts or obligations have been paid before any plat is filed. 
20.1.15  Right to Deny . 
The City may deny a plat and any approval pursuant to this UDC if the applicant: 1) does not submit an administratively complete application in accordance with this Article within the required time frames of the Commission and City Council approved meeting schedule; or 2) pay full filing fees.

20.2.2  Schedule of fees, charges and expenses . 
a.  Until all applicable fees, related charges and expenses, if any, have been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any application or appeal under this Article. 
b.  The fee schedule for the purpose of recovering the administrative cost of processing platting and subdivision requests and the public hearings called for by this UDC are identified in the Planning and Engineering Department Fee Schedule. Such fees shall be paid by the applicant and shall not be designed to restrict an applicant's ability to seek a hearing and/or to generate revenue for other than the recovery of actual administrative cost incurred by the City. Immediately upon receipt of such application and fee, the Community Services Director shall note thereon the date of filing, and make a permanent record thereof. 
c.  Each plat shall be processed according to the procedures set forth in this Article, provided however that no plat shall be processed which attempts to amend or remove any covenant(s) or restriction(s) of the preceding plat until such preceding plat or portion of such preceding plat has been vacated or amended by re-plat in compliance with the provisions set forth in this UDC. 
d.  Upon receipt and completion of all appropriate application form(s) and fee(s) by the City, a determination shall be made as to whether the plat is a Type I, Type II, or Type III submission as defined below: 
(1)  Type I plat submission : A plat depicting a subdivision of land that has not been previously platted. 
(2)  Type II plat submission : A plat depicting a re-plat or re-subdivision of land, which at any time during the preceding five years was limited by an interim or permanent zoning classification or deed restriction to residential use of not more than two residential units per lot. A type II plat submission shall require public notice as provided for in this UDC. 
(3)  Type III plat submission : A re-plat designed to amend the preceding plat for which property owner notice is not required, minor plats, and development plats. 
Section 20.3 - General Platting and Development Procedures 
20.3.1  Pre-Application Process . 
Prior to the official filing of any development application specified herein, the subdivider, at his/her option, may consult with and present a proposed plan for the subdivision to the City for comments and advice on the procedures, specifications, and standards required by the City for the subdivision of land. At such a meeting the, City staff may make any suggestions that would direct the proposed subdivision toward desirable objectives and possibly prevent unnecessary work and expense if objectives are not met.

(3)  Procedures and Conditions 
a.  If a Land Study application is submitted in accordance with all of the above requirements, the Land Study shall be deemed to be "complete" and shall be reviewed by the City Engineer and the City. If all of the above requirements have not been satisfied, the Land Study will be deemed "incomplete" and will be rejected without being docketed for Planning and Zoning Commission consideration. 
Once the Land Study is docketed for Planning and Zoning Commission review, the applicant must submit seven (7) final hard copies of the Land Study, Drainage Plan and Utility Plan at the same size previously stipulated, and one (1) .pdf copy of each. 
Once the Preliminary addresses all City review comments, a final submittal of the following items is required: 
 Three (3) full size and one (1) half-size approved plan sets; 
 Two (2) final copies of all engineering reports (if amended from the original submittal); 
 A DVD or CD providing PDF's of all submitted plans and reports; 
A DVD or CD containing all plans as properly georeferenced Geographic Information System (GIS) shapefiles. Shapefiles must be projected to the following coordinate system: NAD 1983 State Plane Texas South Central FIPS 4204 Feet.

c.  The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend, and the City Council require, conditions of approval that; 
(1)  Govern the timing (phasing) or sequencing of the development to ensure that the development is built-out in accordance with a schedule of public improvements to ensure that the development adequately adheres to the City's minimum design criteria for public improvements; 
(2)  Pertain to proposed parkland dedication; 
(3)  Pertain to the conformity of the proposed Land Study to this UDC. 
(4)  Pertains to any issue related to the public health, safety or general welfare of the City. 
(5)  Additional information to be submitted to supplement the submittal of a Preliminary Plat. 
d.  A land study may be submitted for review concurrently with a preliminary plat application, provided that the respective requirements for both types of applications are satisfied as specified by this UDC as amended. If the preliminary plat cannot not be reviewed by the City in time for it to be scheduled on the same Planning and Zoning Commission agenda as the land study, then the preliminary plat shall be denied on the basis of inadequate review time unless the applicant has executed a notarized written waiver of the 30-day review period for the preliminary plat. 
(4)  Effect of Review 
a.  The Land Study shall be used only as an aid to show the anticipate layout of the proposed development and to assess the adequacy of public facilities/services needed to serve the proposed development. Any proposed use or development depicted on the land study shall not be deemed formal authorization or approval by the City until Final Plat is approved by the City and recorded by the County Clerk of Guadalupe County. If the applicant chooses to plat only an initial phase or phases of the development, a new land study shall not be required for plat approval of subsequent phases if the proposed development layout, character, and/or other conditions affecting the development do not substantially change from one phase to the next or deviate from the spirit and intent or the original land study approved by the City. 
b.  An approved land study shall be valid for a period of five (5) years, or as otherwise specified by the Texas Local Government Code, from the date of land study approval by the City Council. Prior to the lapse of approval for a land study, the property owner may petition the City Council to extend the land study approval. Such petition shall be considered at a public meeting before the City Council and an extension may be granted by the City Council at such meeting. If no petition for extension of land study approval is submitted by the property owner prior to the expiration date, the land study shall be deemed to have expired and shall become null and void. In the case of a phased development, a land study will not be deemed to have expired if the development is progressing in accordance with the phasing schedule of the original land study approved by the City, or if the delay in completing the land study is necessitated by the timing of public improvements required to adequately serve properties in the affected property. 
c.  In determining whether to grant a request for extension, the City Council shall take into account the reasons for the lapse, the ability of the property owner to comply with the conditions attached to the original approval, and the extent to which the UDC in effect at the time of the extension request shall apply to the land study. In the event the City Council denies a request for extension, the property owner must thereafter submit a new land study application for approval, and shall conform to all applicable regulations then in effect. 
d.  The City Council may grant extension of the land study subject to additional conditions based upon the applicable City regulations and/or State legislation in effect at the time that the extension is requested, or such as are necessary to ensure compliance with the original conditions of approval. In granting an extension, the City Council will require that the land study adhere to all UDC requirements in effect at the time that the extension in requested, which shall include the Cibolo Design and Construction Manual. 
e.  The City Council may specify a shorter time for extension of the Land Study than the original five-year (5-year) approval period. 
(5)  Land Study Requirement Not Required 
a.  The requirement to obtain approval of a Land Study prior to beginning the platting process of a development may not be required when the Planning and Engineering Director or his/her designee determines that the scope of the development can fully be resolved through the platting and site plan review processes or in those instances where plats are filed in accordance with a previously approved Land Study.

20.3.14  Replatting . 
a.  Re-plat required . Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein, a property owner who proposes to re-plat any portion of an already approved and filed final plat, other than to amend or vacate the plat, must first obtain approval for the re-plat under the standards and procedures prescribed for the re-platting of land by this Ordinance. All improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the same requirements as for a final plat as provided herein. The City Planner may waive or modify requirements for a preliminary re-plat under certain circumstances where the proposed re-plat does not involve a large land parcel or an existing structure or business on the subject property, and where the proposed plat revisions are relatively simple in nature. 
b.  Re-platting without vacating preceding plat . A re-plat of a final plat or portion of a final plat may be recorded and is controlling over the preceding plat without vacation of that plat if the re-plat: 
1.  Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being re-platted; 
2.  Is approved after a public hearing on the matter at which parties in interest and citizens have an opportunity to be heard by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council; and 
3.  Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions previously incorporated in the final plat. 
Notice of the public hearing required under this section shall be given before the 15th calendar day before the date of the hearing by publication in an official newspaper or a newspaper of general circulation in the County. Notice of the public hearing shall also be given by written notice before the 15th calendar day before the date of the hearing, with a copy or description of any requested waivers and a copy of Section 212.015 (c) of the Texas Local Government Code, sent to the property owners, as documented on the most recently approved ad valorem tax roll of the City of lots that are in the original subdivision and that are within 200 feet of the lot(s) to be re-platted. In the case of a subdivision in the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the most recently approved County tax roll shall be used. The written notice may be delivered by depositing the notice, properly addressed with appropriate postage paid, in a post office or postal depository within the boundaries of the City. 
c.  Residential re-plat . In addition to compliance with (b) above, a re-plat without vacation of the preceding plat must conform to the requirements of this Section if: 
1.  During the preceding five years any of the area to be re-platted was limited by an interim or permanent zoning classification to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot; or 
2.  Any lot in the preceding plat was limited by deed restrictions to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot. 
d.  If the property owner(s) of twenty (20) percent or more of the total land area of lots to whom notice is required to be given under Subsection (b) above file with the City a written protest of the re-platting before or at the public hearing, and the re-plat requires a waiver as defined in this UDC, then approval of the re-plat will require the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the Commission members present. For a legal protest, written instruments signed by the owners of at least 20% of the total land area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed re-plat and extending two hundred (200) feet from that area, but within the original subdivision, must be filed with the City prior to the close of the public hearing. In computing the percentage of land area subject to the "20% rule" described above, the area of streets and alleys shall be included. 
e.  Compliance with Subsection (c.) above is not required for approval of a re-plat for any part of a preceding plat if the area to be re-platted was designated or reserved for other than single or two family residential use by notation on the last legally recorded plat or in the legally recorded restrictions applicable to the plat. For example, for a re-plat involving nonresidential property, a public hearing must be held, pursuant to Subsection (b.2.) above, but notice of the hearing does not have to appear in the newspaper and written notices do not have to be mailed to individual property owners within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property. 
f.  Any re-plat that adds or deletes lots must include the original subdivision and lot boundaries. If a re-plat is submitted for only a portion of a previously platted subdivision, the re-plat must reference the previous subdivision name and recording information, and must state on the re-plat the specific lots which have changed along with a detailed "Purpose for Re-plat" statement. 
g.  If the previous plat is vacated as prescribed in Section 212.013 of the Texas Local Government Code, as amended, and as provided in this UDC, a public hearing is not required for a re-plat of the area vacated. It would, instead, be submitted as a "preliminary or final plat" and reviewed accordingly. 
h.  The re-plat of the subdivision shall meet all the requirements for a final plat for a new subdivision that may be pertinent, as provided for herein. 
i.  The title shall identify the document as a "Final Plat" of the "___________ Addition, Block ___________, Lot(s) ___________, being a Re-plat of Block ___________, Lot(s) ___________ of the ___________ Addition, an addition to the City of Cibolo, Texas, as recorded in Volume ___________, Page ___________ of the Plat Records of ___________ County, Texas". 
j.  An application submittal for a re-plat shall be the same as for a final plat, and shall be accompanied by all items required for final plats including the required number of copies of the plat, a completed application form, and the required application fee. 
k.  The re-plat shall also bear a detailed "Purpose for Re-plat" statement which describes exactly what has been changed on the plat since the original (or previous) plat was approved by the City and filed at the County. 
l.  The re-plat shall be filed at the County in the same manner as prescribed for a final plat, and approval of a re-plat shall expire if all filing materials are not submitted to the City, and if the re-plat is not filed at the County within the time periods specified for a final plat.

(c)  The amendment does not increase the number of lots; and 
(d)  The amendment does not create or require the creation of a new street or make necessary the extension of municipal facilities. 
c.  The City Planner may approve amending plats administratively, or, for any reason, may elect to present the amending plat to the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council for consideration and approval. Any decision made on the amending plat by the Planning and Engineering Director shall be approval of the plat. Should the City refuse to approve the amending plat, then the plat shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council for review and approval within the time period required by State law.

(b)  That the proposed modification provides for better project design; 
(c)  That the standards of population density, site area and dimensions, site coverage, yard spaces, heights of structures, distances between structures, usable open space and off-street parking and off-street loading facilities will be such that the development will not generate more traffic than the streets in the vicinity can carry without congestion and will not overload the utilities; 
(d)  That the development is planned with adequate provisions for light, air, vehicular and pedestrian circulation and recreational facilities equal to or better than the requirements of this UDC; 
(e)  That the combination of different dwelling types and/or the variety of land uses in the development will complement each other and will harmonize with existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity;

1.0 - Introduction 
    1.1 Purpose of this Study 
    The 2007 Water System Capital Improvements Plan for the City of Cibolo has been developed so that the projected water need for the municipality can be met for the next 10 years. The plan was developed by Espey Consultants, Inc. with guidance from City staff and the Impact Fee Committee appointed by City Council. The plan should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis, in connection with updates to the City Master Plan or other planning documents, or as needed to reflect changing conditions. 
    1.2 Description of the Planning Area 
    For the purposes of this study, the planning area is defined by the City's Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN). This area is defined by jurisdictional and geographic considerations, existing water service, and practical limitations of service. The planning area encompasses an area of 5,596 acres (8.74 square miles). 
    The adjacent water service areas receive service from City of Schertz and Green Valley Special Utility District. The northern portions of Cibolo's city limits, and portions of its ETJ, are actually served by GVSUD. Properties within the GVSUD service area are not subject to impact fees assessed by the City of Cibolo. Figure 1 shows the location of the CCN and Planning Area. 
Figure 1 Planning Area 

City of Cibolo 
The City's CCN for water service is CCN #11903, submitted on March 1, 1986 and created on November 2, 2000. 
2.0 - Existing Water System 
    The purpose of this appendix is to provide a description of the existing capital improvements within the service area and the costs to upgrade, update, improve, expand, or replace the improvements to meet existing needs and usage and stricter safety, efficiency, and environmental or regulatory standards. In addition, this appendix provides an analysis of the total capacity, level of current usage, and commitments for usage of capacity of the existing capital improvements. 
    2.1 Water Supply 
    The City of Cibolo currently draws its potable water from the Canyon Regional Water Authority (CRWA) water treatment plant at Lake Dunlap. 
    2.1.1 Water Rights 
    The City of Cibolo is a member entity of CRWA and contracts its surface water rights through them. Other members include BexarMet, Green Valley SUD, City of Marion, Crystal Clear WSC, East Central WSC, and Springs Hill WSC. The City has a contract capacity of 1,098,073 gallons per day (gpd) and up to 1,427,495 gpd based on a contracted peaking factor of 1.3. Cibolo's ownership of the total 15,200,000 gpd plant capacity is specified at 1,702,732 gpd, approximately 11%. Any water processed over and above the ownership amount will incur a system capacity fee as determined by the member entities. 
    2.2 Water Storage 
    There are two main service water storage tanks at Cibolo Valley Drive and Deer Creek Boulevard. The ground storage tank's capacity is 1 million gallons (MG) and the average daily minimum storage is maintained at 984,395 gallons. The cylindrical elevated tank is 1.25 mg and the average daily minimum water storage maintained is 0.85 mg. 
    The volume of this existing elevated storage allows for approximately 12,500 connections based on the TCEQ 100 gallons per connection requirement. Assuming a 200 gallon per connection total storage requirement, and a combined (ground and elevated) volume of 2.25 MG, the City has storage capacity in place for 11,250 connections. The City currently has approximately 3,500 connections, and therefore the current storage is adequate to meet TCEQ's requirement for storage. 
    2.3 Water Distribution 
    2.3.1 Water Mains 
    The city currently maintains a network of approximately 13 miles of pipes (10" mains and larger) within the city's jurisdiction to distribute water to individual meters from storage tanks. An existing system map is shown in Appendix A. 
    2.3.2 Water Pumps 
    Three booster pumps provide water to the city's distribution system. These pumps, numbers 1, 2 and 3, are located at the pump house on Cibolo Valley Drive. These pumps move water from the standpipe to the elevated tank and distribution system. The simultaneous operating capacity for the city's booster pumps is 850 gpm (1,224,000 gallons per day), considering limitation and losses due to suction, discharge piping, or power arrangement. Cibolo's booster pump station has the capacity to meet its contract capacity. The following is a summary of the pump capacities. 
Number 1 Rated Capacity: .26 mgd 250 gpm 148 feet 77.2 psi Actual Capacity: .40 mgd 376 gpm 96.7 feet 77.2 psi Number 2 Rated Capacity: .52 mgd 463 gpm 156 feet 88.1 psi Actual Capacity: .60 mgd 533 gpm 122 feet 88.1 psi Number 3 Rated Capacity: .52 mgd 463 gpm 156 feet 88.1 psi Actual Capacity: .60 mgd 533 gpm 122 feet 88.1 psi  
    Five booster pumps provide water to Cibolo's elevated tank from the CRWA regional supply system. These pumps are identical in design and capacity. The simultaneous operating capacity for the CRWA's booster pumps is 11,000 gpm considering limitation by suction, discharge piping or power arrangement. The rated capacity of a single pump exceeds Cibolo's contract capacity and highest historic peak use. 
Numbers 1-5 Rated Capacity: 2.376 mgd 2,200 gpm 500 feet 216 psi Actual Capacity: 2.376 mgd 2,200 gpm 500 feet 216 psi  
    2.3.3 Pressure Zones 
    The planning area served at this time is currently in one pressure zone. 
    2.3.4 Meter Distribution 
    Table 3 summarizes the size and count of meters in the existing system. The smallest size currently used is 5/8 " and the largest is 10". The American Water Works Association standard equivalency was utilized to determine the total number of living unit equivalencies (LUEs) for the City of Cibolo's water service area, based on the size and number of meters. There are 3,577 LUEs being served by the existing system.

    The historic daily average water use is also presented in the following chart, to illustrate the City's historic use pattern with respect to its contract capacity, its pumping capacity, and the CRWA's pumping capacity. 
Figure 2 Daily Average Water Use and Capacities 
Figure 2 Daily Average Water Use and Capacities 
Daily Average Water Use 
September 2002 - May 2007 

    Based on an analysis of recent water use records, the existing usage rate per LUE was established to be 361 gallons per day. This rate was determined by calculating the average daily water usage for each month divided by the number of meters present on the system each month during the year 2006. This value was reviewed and found to be consistent with other recent, regional studies and standards and subsequently adopted by the Impact Fee Committee. 
    3.2 Unaccounted For Water 
    Normal water loss includes such items as main flushing, testing, undetected leaks, and water obtained through hydrant usage by different entities. Reduction of water loss percentage is recommended, as it will affect future water supply projections. The City does not have a formal water audit program at this time. 
4.0 - Existing System Hydraulic Analysis 
    In order to determine the improvements required to meet existing needs, a hydraulic analysis was performed. 
    4.1 Analysis Technique 
    4.1.1 Method of Analysis 
    Hydraulic modeling software was utilized to accurately calculate the hydraulic response for several scenarios including fire simulations and peak hour demands. Steady state simulations were performed with MWSoft, Inc. H20Map Water GIS Suite v. 7.0. These types of simulations give a "snap shot" of the system based on demands and elevation/pressure of water supply to the system. No "Extended Period" simulations were performed. 
    4.1.2 System Model 
    The existing water distribution system was imported into the hydraulic modeling software. Pipelines with diameters smaller than 10 inches were not modeled. Water demand was allocated to different nodes in the system based on land use and calculated water demand. Platted lots were assumed to be occupied for the purposes of flow allocation, since they represent a commitment to current capacity. 
    4.1.3 Planning and Design Criteria 
    The design criteria utilized in the model were developed from state standards, known existing system characteristics, and generally accepted engineering principles. The criteria are summarized in the following table: 
Table 3 Planning and Design Criteria 
Table 3 Planning and Design Criteria 
Parameter Criteria People per connection 2.8 Average Day Demand 361 gpd Maximum Day Demand 722 gpd Fire Flow Residential 1,000 gpm Fire Flow/Other 3,000 gpm Minimum Maximum Day Pressure 50 psi Minimum Average Day Pressure 50 psi Minimum Peak Hour Pressure 35 psi Minimum Fire Flow Pressure 20 psi at Maximum Day Demand Total Storage 200 gal/LUE Pump Capacity 0.6 gpm/LUE Max Velocity - Peak Hour 5 fps Max Velocity - Fire Flow 10 fps Max Static Pressure 110 psi Max Pressure (must provide PRV) 85 psi  
    4.1.4 Computer Model Correlation 
    The modeled system was not calibrated. 
    4.2 System Analysis 
    The existing system was analyzed. Fires at several different locations were modeled with peak day demands. No deficiencies were identified during this analysis. All velocities were below 10 fps and pressures at all modeled nodes were well above 20 psi. This is consistent with observations and reports by operation personnel and City staff. 
5.0 - 10-Year Capital Improvements Program 
    The purpose of this section is to provide a description of the capital improvements and their costs necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area over the next ten years. 
    This section also defines the specific quantity of water consumption for a service unit and provides an equivalency table establishing the ratio of a service unit to various types of land uses, including residential, commercial, and industrial. 
    5.1 Future Land Use Assumptions 
    Future demands to the water system are determined by future land use assumptions. These assumptions were defined in workshops with City Staff, the Impact Fee Committee, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council. The intent of the workshop exercises was to evaluate the entire city's planning area (which extends beyond the water service area) and determine the most likely, balanced and orderly land use pattern for the period 2007-2017. Residential and non-residential land use classifications are indicated as follows on the attached copy of the Future Land Use Assumptions Map (Appendix B). Residential uses indicate the future density in terms of dwelling units per acre or DUA. The land use classifications include: cluster residential (0-2 DUA), single-family residential (2-4.5 DUA), attached residential (6-12 DUA), mixed use (6-16 DUA), institutional, commercial, industrial, and park/open space/preserve. 
    Future land use equivalencies for service units follow: 
Table 4 Equivalencies - Land Use Equivalency Table 
Table 4 Equivalencies
Land Use Equivalency Table 
Land Use Classification LUE Conversion Single-Family/Cluster 1 Dwelling Unit = 1 LUE Attached Residential 1 Dwelling Unit = 0.7 LUE Commercial 1 1 LUE/1,660 sf floor area Industrial 1 LUE/4,000 sf floor area Institutional 2 2.5 LUE/acre Mixed Use 3 50% Commercial/Retail/Office 30% Residential 20% Institutional/Public/Civic  
Notes: 
1) Commercial development assumes 20% available land area is building area 
2) Institutional use ratio is consistent with other direct methods 
3) Mixed use assumes ratio identified in Table 20, City of Cibolo Master Plan 
    Demands are projected for each area by assuming 361 gallons per day per LUE. The existing system serves 3,577 LUEs. The total number of projected LUEs necessitated by and attributable to new development is 10,724. In order to serve these additional units, capital improvements are necessary. 
    5.2 Capital Improvements 
    Improvement alternatives were placed into the hydraulic model to determine the minimum requirements to serve the projected demands. The improvements provide a minimum of 34 psi under fire flow conditions, above the required minimum of 20 psi. With the exception of the short pipe feed to the existing tank, all velocities are below the required maximums. 
    The table included as Appendix C describes the type of improvements required and associated costs as allowed under LGC § 395.012, to meet the City of Cibolo's anticipated growth until 2017. It is anticipated that these projects will be implemented according to most immediate need, and will become part of the City's 5-year Capital Improvements Program as prioritized by the CIP Committee and City Council.

1.0 - Introduction 
    1.1 Executive Summary 
    This report is provided in support of a Capital Improvement Plan, which is necessary to calculate the 2007 Wastewater Impact Fees. This plan has been developed to meet the projected wastewater needs for the next 10 years. All wastewater flows are derived from land use projections provided by the City of Cibolo. The capital improvements criteria for this evaluation generally apply to gravity lines over 8" diameters, force mains, and lift stations. No capital improvement costs are associated with the treatment plant. These fees are developed separately by Cibolo Creek Municipal Authority (CCMA) and will be passed on to all its customers. Cibolo assesses impact fees associated with necessary improvements to its collection system, which come in addition to CCMA's impact fees. 
    The City's existing wastewater system was modeled to determine the existing level of service. There are currently 4,716 Living Unit Equivalents (LUEs) in the City's Wastewater Service Area. Future land use assumptions were established to guide future system improvement needs. There will be 27,222 LUEs in the City's Water Service Area by 2017. 
    Nineteen Capital Improvement Projects totaling $21,353,048 are necessary to accommodate the 22,506 LUEs attributable to growth. Not including eligible finance costs as allowed under Local Government Code (LGC) § 395.012(b) or the alternative 50% credit described under LGC $395.014(7)(B), the initial impact fee is calculated to be $949.00 per wastewater service unit. Including these items, the impact fee per water service unit is calculated to be: $749.19.

    1.3 Description of the Planning Area 
    For the purposes of this study, the planning area is defined by the City's Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN). This area is defined by jurisdictional and geographic considerations, existing water service, and practical limitations of service. The planning area encompasses an area of 10,314 acres (16.1 square miles). 
    The adjacent areas receive wastewater service from City of Schertz and Green Valley Special Utility District (GVSUD). Portions of the City's corporate limits and ETJ are served by GVSUD. Properties within the GVSUD service area are not subject to impact fees assessed by the City of Cibolo. Figure 1 shows the location of the CCN and Planning Area.

2.0 - Existing Wastewater System 
    The purpose of this appendix is to provide a description of the existing capital improvements within the service area and the costs to upgrade, update, improve, expand, or replace the improvements to meet existing needs and usage and stricter safety, efficiency, and environmental or regulatory standards. In addition, this appendix provides an analysis of the total capacity, level of current usage, and commitments for usage of capacity of the existing capital improvements. 
    2.1 Relationship to Other Entities 
    As indicated previously, the City of Cibolo does not provide treatment services for wastewater. This function is provided in an agreement with Cibolo Creek Municipal Authority (CCMA), which owns and operates the regional wastewater treatment facility. City of Cibolo wastewater flows to the CCMA treatment plant via two routes. One is the Loop 539 lift station, which is located inside the city limits and pumps the effluent to the CCMA regional plant. The other is through wastewater lines that generally flow west through the City of Schertz. Since the City does not operate the CCMA treatment plant, the wastewater infrastructure evaluated in this plan are the major collection lines and lift stations that transport all flows to the Loop 539 lift station. No capital improvements were considered for the portion of the network that flows through the City of Schertz, since this portion of the City is built-out. Also, the Capital Improvements Plan (CIP) does not include any over-sizing to serve areas outside of the Planning Area. 
    2.2 Wastewater Collection System 
    The existing collection system consists of 6"-24" diameter pipes. Most of these are PVC. However, some of the older pipes and service laterals are concrete or clay. Replacement of these lines is not an eligible impact fee expenditure, and will have to be replaced or repaired as a maintenance project. Appendix A is a map of the existing collection system. Although the system contains pipes less than 8" diameter, only those lines greater than 8" were evaluated. 
    2.3 Existing Lift Stations 
    The City currently owns and operates two lift stations (Willowbridge and Cibolo Vista). Each station is sufficient to serve the existing area flowing into each, as they were sized to accommodate the developments that they serve. The Loop 539 lift station is owned and operated by CCMA. 
    2.4 Determination of Existing Flows 
    Flows are not metered at any point in Cibolo's collection system. CCMA charges a treatment fee based upon water use data. It is not possible to evaluate winter averages to determine wastewater flow, because the City of Cibolo's water service area is not coterminous with its wastewater service area (recall that portions of the City are served by Green Valley SUD). Therefore, the existing flow rate per living unit equivalency (LUE) must be estimated based on the water consumption rate per LUE. The Water System Impact Fee Study - Master Plan was prepared at the same time as this study, and derived 361 gallons per day per LUE. 
    Based on an evaluation of seasonal water use patterns, the wastewater flow per LUE was determined by using 75% of the water demand rate per LUE (361 gallons per day), and is calculated to be 271 gallons per day per LUE: 
361 gpd/LUE x 0.75 = 271 gpd/LUE 
    2.5 Determination of Number of Living Unit Equivalencies 
    Within the City of Cibolo's wastewater service area, there are 4,716 existing wastewater customers. Therefore, there are currently 4,716 LUEs within the City's service area. 
3.0 - Existing System Hydraulic Analysis 
    In order to determine the improvements required to meet existing needs, a hydraulic analysis was performed. 
    3.1 Analysis Technique 
    3.1.1 Method of Analysis 
    A computer hydraulic model (InfoWorks) was developed to assess the capacity of the City's collection system. InfoWorks software is a GIS-based platform that incorporates standard engineering algorithms and enables time-series flow data to assess capacities and restrictions. 
    3.1.2 System Model and Flow Allocation 
    The existing collection system was imported into the hydraulic modeling software. Pipelines with diameters smaller than 8" were not modeled. Existing wastewater flows were calculated according to the flow rate per LUE (see section 2.4), and allocated to different nodes in the system based on known flow patterns and land use. 1 Platted lots were assumed to be occupied for the purposes of flow allocation, since they represent a commitment to current capacity. A free outfall at the Loop 539 lift station wet well was assumed. 2 
1  Nodes are points within the network, such as junctions or manholes. In some instances these nodes mark the point that flows are introduced into the network. 
2  The free outfall assumption means that the wet well of the lift station is sufficiently sized such that the level in the wet well never exceeds the incoming flowlines of the wastewater mains, creating a tailwater condition at the pipe outfall. 
    3.1.3 Planning and Design Criteria 
    The design criteria utilized in the model were developed from state standards, known existing system characteristics, and generally accepted engineering principles. The criteria are summarized in the following table: 
Table 1 Planning and Design Criteria 
Criteria Value Person/LUE 2.8 Average Dry Weather Flow ADWF =70 gallons/person

Max Velocity = 8 fps Living Unit Equivalent 1 LUE = 271 gpd Manhole Spacing 1 MH /300 feet  
    3.1.4 Computer Model Correlation 
    The modeled system was not calibrated as flows have not been metered. 
    3.2 System Analysis 
    The existing system was analyzed. Some areas of restriction were noticed in peak wet weather scenarios; however the impact was limited to surcharge in manholes and no overflows were indicated. Therefore, the existing system is adequate to serve the existing population. This is consistent with observations and reports by operation personnel and City staff. 
4.0 - 10-Year Capital Improvements Program 
    The purpose of this section is to provide a description of the capital improvements and their costs necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area over the next ten years. 
    This section also defines the specific quantity of wastewater flow for a service unit and provides an equivalency table establishing the ratio of a service unit to various types of land uses, including residential, commercial, and industrial. 
    4.1 Future Land Use Assumptions 
    Future demands to the wastewater system are determined by future land use assumptions. These assumptions were defined in workshops with City Staff, the Impact Fee Committee, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council. The intent of the workshop exercises was to evaluate the entire city's planning area (which extends beyond the water service area) and determine the most likely, balanced and orderly land use pattern for the period 2007-2017. Residential and non-residential land use classifications are indicated as follows on the attached copy of the Future Land Use Assumptions Map (Appendix B). Residential uses indicate the future density in terms of dwelling units per acre or DUA. The land use classifications include: cluster residential (0-2 DUA), single-family residential (2-4.5 DUA), attached residential (6-12 DUA), mixed use (6-16 DUA), institutional, commercial, industrial, and park/open space/preserve. 3 
3  Cluster residential development is characterized by denser areas of development and larger areas of set-aside open space, resulting in a low, overall average density. Attached residential development is characterized by narrow lots and often zero side yard setbacks, such as townhomes, garden homes, patio homes, etc. 
    Future land use equivalencies for service units follow: 
Table 2 Equivalencies 
Table 2 Equivalencies 
Land Use Equivalency Table Land Use Classification LUE Conversion Single-Family/Cluster 1 Dwelling Unit = 1 LUE Attached Residential 1 Dwelling Unit = 0.7 LUE Commercial 1 1 LUE/1,660 sf floor area Industrial 1 LUE/4,000 sf floor area Institutional 2 2.5 LUE/acre Mixed Use 3 50% Commercial/Retail/Office 30% Residential 20% Institutional/Public/Civic  
 Notes: 
 1) Commercial development assumes 20% available land area is building area 
 2) Institutional use ratio is consistent with other direct methods 
 3) Mixed use assumes ratio identified in Table 20, City of Cibolo Master Plan 
    Flows are forecast for each area by assuming 271 gallons per day per LUE, consistent with the existing system flow rate assumption. The existing system serves 4,716 LUEs. The total number of projected LUEs in the City's service area by 2017 is 27,222. The total number of projected LUEs necessitated by and attributable to new development is 22,506. In order to serve these additional units, capital improvements are necessary. 
    4.2 Capital Improvements 
    Improvement alternatives were placed into the hydraulic model to determine the minimum requirements to serve the projected demands for service. Wastewater lines serving future areas of development were sized and located in natural drainage ways and along alignments of future roadways shown in the City's Future Thoroughfare Plan. 
    The table included as Appendix C describes the type of improvements required and associated costs as allowed under Tex. Local Government Code § 395.012, to meet the City of Cibolo's anticipated growth until 2017. It is anticipated that these projects will be implemented according to most immediate need, and will become part of the City's 5-year Capital Improvements Program (CIP) as prioritized by the CIP Committee and City Council.

1.0 - Chapter 1. Introduction 
    1.1 Purpose of this Study 
    The 2007 Drainage Capital Improvements Plan for the City of Cibolo has been developed so that the drainage capacity for the municipality can be met for the next 10 years. The plan was developed by Espey Consultants, Inc. with guidance from City Staff and the Impact Fee Committee appointed by City Council. The plan should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis, in connection with updates to the City Master Plan or other planning documents, or as needed to reflect changing conditions. 
    1.2 Description of the Planning Area 
Figure 1 Town Creek Watershed 

    For the purposes of this study, the planning area is defined by the Town Creek watershed. The Dietz Creek drainage system, serving the western portion of the City, has been built to its capacity. Figure 1 shows the Town Creek watershed. 
2.0 - Existing Town Creek Drainage System 
    The purpose of this appendix is to provide a description of the existing capital improvements within the service area and the costs to upgrade, update, improve, expand, or replace the improvements to meet existing needs and usage and stricter safety, efficiency, environmental or regulatory standards. In addition, this appendix provides an analysis of the total capacity, level of current usage, and commitments for usage of capacity of the existing capital improvements. 
    2.1 Methodology 
    In order to determine the capacity of the existing Town Creek drainage system, a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis was performed. Details of the analysis and methodology are found in the report "City of Cibolo Flood Protection Plan: A Master Plan for Managing Town Creek (September 1, 2007, Espey Consultants, Inc.)". 
    The results of this study indicate that improvements are necessary to provide a 25-year level of flood protection in several existing problem areas. Consequently, improvements are also necessary in some areas to provide a 100-year level of protection. This study determined that in some areas, a 100-year level of protection was not cost-justified. For this reason, a 100-year level of protection criterion is not uniformly applied throughout the watershed; rather, the highest level of protection (25-year or 100-year) that can reasonably be achieved is the criterion for which improvements have been considered for. 
    2.2 Impervious Cover 
    Hard surfaces which do not permit the absorption of rainfall into the soil, thus resulting in increased stormwater runoff, are known as impervious cover. Impervious cover is the basic, quantifiable and common unit that creates the need for drainage improvements. There are currently 49,964,782 square feet of impervious cover in the Town Creek watershed. 
    2.3 Living Unit Equivalency 
    To determine the amount of impervious cover attributable to a living unit equivalency, a typical R-2B zoned lot was evaluated and calculated to account for approximately 3,462 square feet of impervious surfaces. This includes impervious surfaces that are placed on the lot, as well as some that are within the right-of-way but attributable to the unit, such as the driveway apron, curb and pavement measured to the road centerline for the width of the property. 
    Based on this calculation, there are 11,055 existing LUEs in the service area. 
3.0 - 10-Year Capital Improvements Program 
    The purpose of this section is to provide a description of the capital improvements and their costs necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area over the next ten years. This section also defines the specific quantity of impervious cover for a service unit and provides an equivalency table establishing the ratio of a service unit to various types of land uses, including residential, commercial, and industrial. 
    3.1 Future Land Use Assumptions 
    Future impervious cover is determined by future land use assumptions. These assumptions were defined in workshops with City Staff, the Impact Fee Committee, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council. The intent of the workshop exercises was to evaluate the entire city's planning area (which extends beyond the water service area) and determine the most likely, balanced and orderly land use pattern for the period 2007-2017. 
    Residential and non-residential land use classifications are indicated as follows on the attached copy of the Future Land Use Assumptions Map (Appendix A). Residential uses indicate the future density in terms of dwelling units per acre or DUA. The land use classifications include: cluster residential (0-2 DUA), single-family residential (2-4.5 DUA), attached residential (6-12 DUA), mixed use (6-16 DUA), institutional, commercial, industrial, and park/open space/preserve. 
    Future land use equivalencies for service units follow Table 1. 
Table 1 Land Use Equivalency Table 
Table 1 Land Use Equivalency Table 
Land Use Equivalency Table Land Use Classification LUE Conversion Single-family/Cluster 1 Dwelling Unit = 1 LUE = 3,462 sf impervious cover Attached Residential  (60% of land area) ÷ 3,462 sf = Number of LUEs Commercial  (75% of land area) ÷ 3,462 sf = Number of LUEs Industrial  (40% of land area) ÷ 3,462 sf = Number of LUEs Institutional  (20% of land area) ÷ 3,462 sf = Number of LUEs Mixed Use  (75% of land area) ÷ 3,462 sf = Number of LUEs  
    Impervious cover is projected for each area by assuming 3,462 square feet per LUE. The existing drainage system serves 11,055 LUEs. The total number of projected LUEs necessitated by and attributable to new development is 15,310. In order to serve these additional units, capital improvements are necessary. 
    3.2 Capital Improvements 
    Improvement alternatives were identified by placing the impervious cover assumptions into the hydrologic model, then using the hydraulic model to size the improvements. 
    The table included as Appendix B describes the type of improvements required and associated costs as allowed under Tex. Local Government Code § 395.012, to meet the City of Cibolo's anticipated growth until 2017. The corresponding project locations are identified on the Appendix A map. It is anticipated that these projects will be implemented according to most immediate need, and will become part of the City's 5-year Capital Improvements Program as prioritized by the CIP Committee and City Council.

1.0 - Introduction: Executive Summary 
    The following Impact Fee Study was developed for the 2008 Capital Improvements Plan for the City of Cibolo. The Capital Improvements Plan (CIP) consists of various roadway projects proposed in order to provide safe transportation alternatives designed to accommodate the city's growth over a ten-year period. The plan should be updated annually to account for any changes in the Transportation Master Plan or as needed to reflect changing conditions. 
    Cost estimates were used in conjunction with Living Unit Equivalents (LUE) based on land use assumptions to develop a method for applying impact fees. Existing and future LUE's will benefit from the improvements and therefore the cost is distributed across the total number of LUE's both existing and projected for the ten-year period. The impact fee study has established two zones. The North Zone consists of those areas within the City Limits of Cibolo north of SH 78. There will be 38,504 LUE's within the North Zone with 27 CIP projects totaling $112,741,786.04 planned to accommodate the LUE's. The South Zone consists of those areas within the City Limits of Cibolo south of SH 78. There will be 11,867 LUE's within the South Zone with five CIP projects totaling $12,652,740.40 proposed to accommodate the LUE's. Including the eligible finance costs as allowed under Tex. Local Government Code § 395.012(b) and the alternative 50% credit described under Tex. Local Government Code § 395.014(7)(B), the impact fees per LUE is calculated to be $1,464.02 for the North Zone and $533.10 for the South Zone.

    1.2 Description of Planning Area 
    The planning area includes all areas within the City of Cibolo limits, located in Guadalupe County and Bexar County. Because there are locations within the City Limits which are more than six miles from some of the proposed CIP projects, the Transportation Impact Fees are calculated based on two zones. The North Zone consists of the areas within the City Limits north of SH 78. The South Zone consists of the areas within the City Limits south of SH 78. Cost estimates were made based on roadway lengths inside the city limits. Construction outside the city limits was not included in the cost estimates. Any CIP projects lying on the edge of the city limits were proportioned between the City of Cibolo and the bordering jurisdictions. Costs for CIP projects located on SH 78 were divided between the North and South Zones. 
2.0 - Population and Land Use Projections 
    Future transportation demand is determined by future land use assumptions. The future land uses were determined during three previous Impact Fee Studies prepared for the City of Cibolo by Espey Consultants, Inc. The following is an excerpt from those reports regarding the future land uses: 
"The assumptions were defined in workshops with City Staff, the Impact Fee Advisory Committee, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council. The intent of the workshop exercises was to evaluate the entire city's planning area (which extends beyond the service area) and determine the most likely, balanced and orderly land use pattern for the period 2007-2017. The anticipated growth pattern of the city, in terms of the location, use, and intensity of the use, is based upon the following considerations: 
¦  Average annual residential building permit growth of 4% for the period 2003-2007 [1]. 
¦  Average annual sales tax revenue growth of 31% for the period 2003-2007 [2]. 
¦  Populations projections of the 2005 Master Plan [3]. 
¦  Trend of higher consumer expenditures per household closer to Cibolo's center, relative to greater distances from the city's center [4]. 
¦  Retail and commercial uses are anticipated along state highways and major intersections, in response to the population growth and anticipated demand for services. 
¦  The city's largest private employers have announced plans to expand their operations and hire additional workforce. 
¦  The availability of utilities and regional transportation infrastructure. 
¦  The location of floodplains, railroads and similar constraints. 
¦  The application of prudent land use planning principles, such as the transition of use intensity and the creation of a center of high activity. 
    2.1 Future Land Use 
    Future land use assumptions were developed by city staff based on desired development patterns for Cibolo. Different land use areas are shown on the aerial map located in Appendix D, and described as follows: 
    Attached Residential: The attached residential land use areas were assumed to be town homes ranging from six to twelve dwelling units per acre. The acreage multiplied by the dwelling units per acre determined the amount of total dwelling units for a specific region. Where dwelling units were not specified a value of 8 dwelling units per acre was assumed. An average value of 5.86 [5] trips per dwelling unit per day was used for trip calculations. 
    Cluster: Cluster residential development is characterized by denser areas of development and larger areas of set-aside open space, resulting in a low overall average density. Cluster areas were assumed to contain two dwelling units per acre, and trip calculations follow the same assumptions as single-family detached residences, using an average of 9.57 [6] trips per dwelling unit per day. 
    Commercial: Commercial land use areas were assumed to be shopping centers with approximately 20% of the area as gross leasable commercial land. Acreages were converted into units of 1,000 square feet of gross leasable area (GLA), and trips generated were calculated using the average value of 42.94 [7] trips per 1,000 sq. ft. gross leasable area per day based on these areas. 
    Institutional: Institutional areas were determined to be used for Elementary, Middle/Junior High, or High school uses. The trip productions were based on assumed number of students for each type of school, with 850, 1,500, and 2,800 students at elementary, junior high, and high school respectively. 
    Single-family: This land use area was classified as single-family detached housing, with an average trip generation of 9.57 trips per dwelling unit per day. The number of dwelling units per acre was provided for a majority of the areas, where none was provided a value of 4 dwelling units was assumed. 
    Mixed Use: The mixed use regions were split into 25% retail, 30% residential, 15% office, 10% commercial, 10% Public/Civic and 10% institutional areas. The office buildings were assumed to be multi-story and the retail area was classified as a Specialty Retail Center for trip generation purposes. The assumed percentages were based on experience and prior knowledge of land development desires of Cibolo. Trips were calculated using the same averages for the specialized areas mentioned previously. Mixed use assumes ratio identified in Table 20, City of Cibolo Master Plan. 
    Industrial: Industrial zones were assumed to be industrial parks with acreage used for trip production calculations. This land use produces an average of 63.11 [8] trips per acre per day. 
Table 1 shows average trip generation values for each land use as seen in the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Manual.

    2.2 Service Areas 
    For roadway facilities, the service area is limited to an area within the corporate boundaries of the political subdivision and shall not exceed six miles (Tex. Local Government Code § 395.001(9)). The area considered in this analysis includes all areas and roadways within the City of Cibolo limits, which is split into two service areas. Due to the inequality of development and project locations, the overall planning area was divided into North and South zones for impact fee determination. There are a total of 30 projects included in the 10-year capital improvements transportation program, with 25 projects in the North, 4 projects in the south, and one traffic signal project split between the two zones.

3.0 - Existing Transportation Network 
    3.1 General 
    The majority of the City-owned streets and roads inside the city limits consist of older two-lane collector streets built with open ditches. These roads are out of date, with many roads lacking striping and the capacity to carry the traffic loads created by the current population. There is a need for expansion on most collector streets, possibly the development of these roads into minor arterials is necessary. As the roadways are expanded, curb and gutter and storm drain systems should be installed. The existing city-owned transportation network contains little to no facilities for pedestrian or cyclist traffic, so expansion also calls for an inclusion of sidewalks and some bike lanes to accommodate non-auto traffic. 
    In addition, the City of Cibolo is served by state and federal roadways IH 35, IH 10 SH 78, FM 3009 and FM 1103. IH 35 and FM 3009 are roadways bordering the City of Cibolo for only short distances. SH 78 traverses across the city from east to west and is a four-lane roadway with a center left turn lane for most of the distance through the City. FM 1103 is a primary access point for the City of Cibolo and currently consists of a two-lane roadway with minimal shoulders for most of the distance. IH 10 is within the ETJ south of the current Cibolo city limits. The only state or federal funding currently projected for any of these roadways within the City of Cibolo is funding for ROW purchase along FM 1103. Therefore, any needed expansion along these roadways has been included in the CIP program. 
    3.2 Relationship to other Entities 
    The City of Cibolo shares a border with the City of Schertz. Where it was applicable, the roadway projects along these borders were proportioned equally between the two cities. Only the cost applicable to the City of Cibolo was included in impact fee determination. 
    3.3 Existing Signalization 
    Within the City there are four locations in need of new signalization. Flashing light signals or stop signs currently exist at these locations. These facilities do not adequately move traffic and create congestion during peak hours. Turn lanes have been included at the intersections as needed. 
4.0 - 10-Year Capital Improvements Program 
    The 10-Year Capital Improvements Program involves planning, design, construction, and funding of 30 transportation projects in order to equip the city with the means to provide adequate Levels of Service (LOS) for its growing developments. Increasing development, especially single-family housing, will result in more traffic on the roads which creates a demand for an increase in the capacity of the city's existing roads. 
    4.1 Transportation Master Plan 
    The primary objective of the Transportation Master Plan is to increase mobility, efficiency, and safety of Cibolo's roadway system. A Transportation Master Plan was completed as part of the City of Cibolo - Update to the Master Plan (Espey Consultants, Inc., January, 2005) This master plan identified the need for expansion of several existing roadways and the construction of new sections of road. All street constructions and upgrades will be designed as curb and gutter streets to improve drainage from the road. All roadway sections were also designed to equip four foot side walks on both sides of the road. Designated hike-bike facilities, in addition to sidewalks included in estimates, have not been accounted for pending completion of a Parks and Trails Master Plan. 
    4.2 Capital Improvements 
    The projects included in the CIP program are all included in the Transportation Master Plan. Many of the projects were carried forward from the 2007 CIP program and projects 39 through 56 were added due to planned development needs and changing in state and federal funding availability. 
    4.2.1 Signalization 
    Planned development is expected to meet signal warrants to justify signal installation for CIP projects 37, 38, 39 and 40. In addition to the signal installation, turn lanes at new signals were included where needed. Signalization and additional turn lanes are intended to increase circulation around retail developments, as stated in the city's Master Plan. 
    4.2.2 Roadway Improvements and Expansions 
    Several roadway improvements and expansions are needed to increase mobility and ease of access to the Town Center, as is desired by the City's Master Plan. Existing roadways will be expanded to thoroughfare right-of-way widths no less than 66' to accommodate traffic from residential areas into the community center. Capital Improvement Project 45 includes the expansion of the existing Schaefer Road and approximately 400 feet of new bridge construction over a low water crossing. The new bridge will provide mobility and emergency access to projected development. 
    The widening and addition of curb and gutter to existing roadways will require modification of the profile in order to provide adequate drainage to adjacent properties. This will require reconstruction of the entire width of the roadways in most cases. 
    4.2.3 New Roadway Construction 
    There are four new roadway construction projects included in the 10-year Capital Improvements Program. CIP projects 51 through 54 include a future thoroughfare width of 150 feet, which will continue the FM 1103 expansion and create a major arterial. The extension of FM 1103 continues into the south zone and includes CIP 50, in this region. CIP project 46 proposes an 86 foot wide thoroughfare linking FM 78 and CR 374, opening up a new access route to the center of town. 
    4.3 Cost Estimates 
    The cost of each project involves calculating the roadway construction cost, the price of ROW, and the cost of relocating existing utilities (where applicable). The construction costs are based on quantities estimated from typical sections and design experience. Typical sections for the various categories of roadway are included in Appendix B. The price of ROW varies based on project location and ranges from $7,000.00 up to $30,000.00 per acre. Utility relocations are required when overhead poles are in direct conflict with a proposed road, or when underground utilities are in conflict with new cross drainage facilities. The cost of relocation varies depending on the type of utilities, for example overhead electric lines cost approximately $7.50/L.F. to move whereas underground waterlines cost about $60.00/L.F. for relocation construction. See Appendix C for a summary of all estimated costs and detailed calculations for each CIP project. 
    4.4 LUE Determination 
    For transportation purposes, one Living Unit Equivalent (LUE) is equal to a single-family dwelling unit. Future land use assumptions (FLUA) were used to determine how many vehicle trips per weekday would be generated at probable development of the city over the 10 year program period. Using the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation manuals, trip generations based on land use were calculated for all areas shown on the future land use map within the city limits. The expected development for the ten-year CIP period was determined by adjusting the LUE's calculated for each land use area with the probability of development for each area. The probability of development was determined through collaboration between Espey Consultants and city staff based on current development trends, and provided to Cobb Fendley as part of base data for this study. A summary of LUE's and detailed calculations based on land uses can be found in Appendix E. The number of trips calculated for each area was then divided by an average of 9.57 vehicle trips per single-family household per weekday, to determine the LUE's for each area. The North project zone has 38,504 calculated LUE's and the south has 11,867 total LUE's. 
5.0 - Maximum Impact Fee Determination 
    Appendix A shows the derivation of the maximum fees for transportation for both the North Zone and the South Zone. The proposed facility costs, debt service costs for the proposed CIP, and engineering costs are shown, as well as a 50% credit for the CIP and the study. The maximum transportation impact fee is $1,464.02 for the North Zone and $533.10 for the South Zone.
