shall control the deliberations of the Commissioners, provided they are

be the most useful in the orderly consideration of city business before

(C) Point of Order.

at any time whether or not another member of the City Commissioners is
speaking. A point of order is a statement to the Mayor that a
particular motion before the City Commissioners or other matter is out
of order or to make an inquiry of the Mayor as to parliamentary
procedure or for information. As soon as a point of order has been
disposed of, the person interrupted may continue speaking.
(2) In the event that a member asserting a point of order is
overruled by the Mayor, he or she may appeal to the members of City
Commissioners for a final decision. The Mayor shall then briefly state
the reasons for his decision and the decision of the Mayor may be
overruled by a majority vote of the members of the City Commissioners.
(D) Suspension of the Rules. A member of the City Commissioners
may move to suspend the rules that interfere with a particular matter
that is of apparent importance to the Commissioners and should be
considered by the Commissioners immediately or out of order. In order
for this to be accomplished, it is necessary that a majority vote be
obtained. However, a motion to suspend the rules cannot interrupt an
individual speaking.
(E) Motion to Withdraw a Motion. A person making the motion may
move to withdraw his or her motion, and it is withdrawn unless an
objection is raised. If a member of the City Commissioners objects to
the withdrawal of the motion, then the Mayor, upon motion from a member
of the City Commissioners, may put the matter to an immediate vote and
if the majority of the members of the City Commissioners vote to allow
removal of the motion, it is withdrawn.
(F) Motion to Object to the Consideration of a Motion. A member
of the City Commissioners may object to the consideration of a motion,
and such objection may be made at any time, even when a member of the
City Commissioners is speaking. In order to stop the consideration of
a motion, a majority vote of the members of the City Commissioners
present is required, which in no event shall be less than four members
of the City Commissioners.
(G) Tabling. In order to table a motion, a motion must be made
and can only be made at such time when another member of the City
Commissioners is not speaking; the matter must then be put to a vote by
the Mayor and upon a vote of a majority of the members of the City
Commissioners, it may be tabled.
(H) Motion to Close Debate. A motion to close debate on a
particular matter before the Commissioners can only be made at such
time as the person making the motion is recognized by the Mayor and no
one else is speaking. In order to close debate, a majority is
necessary.
2019 S-30 Repl.
 36.75 BURKBURNETT - CITY COMMISSIONERS 34
(I) Motion to Postpone Consideration. A motion may be made to
postpone consideration of a pending motion. This must be made at a time
when the Mayor has recognized the mover and no one else is speaking.
A vote of the majority of the members of the City Commissioners will
carry this motion.
(J) Amending a Motion. A motion may be amended by a member of
the City Commissioners stating that he wishes to amend. This motion is
debatable and can be passed by a majority vote of the members of the
City Commissioners.
(K) Questions to Contain One Subject. All questions submitted
for vote shall contain only one subject. If two or more subjects are
involved, any member of the City Commissioners may require division.
(L) Order of Precedence of Motions. Robert's Rules of Order
Revised shall prevail as to the order of precedence of motions and
types of motions.
(M) Right to Floor. Any member of the City Commissioners
desiring to speak shall be recognized by the Mayor and shall confine
his remarks to the subject under consideration. No member shall speak
more than once to a question until every member wishing to speak shall
have spoken.
(N) Point of Order. The Mayor shall determine all points of
order, subject to the right of any member to appeal to the
Commissioners or request a parliamentary opinion of the City Attorney.
(O) Reconsideration by motion of an action of the commissioners
can be made no later than the next succeeding regular meeting. Such
motion can only be made by a member who voted with the majority. It
can be seconded by any member. No question shall be twice
reconsidered, except by a majority vote of the members of the City
Commissioners, except that action relating to any contract may be
reconsidered at any time, before final execution thereof.

(A) The maximum general service rate for sales of natural gas
rendered to residential and commercial consumers within the city
limits, by the Lone Star Gas Company, a division of Enserch
Corporation, a Texas Corporation, its successors and assigns, is hereby
fixed and determined as set forth in division (H)(1) of this section.
(B) The residential and commercial rates set forth above shall be
adjusted upward or downward from a base of $4.0200 per Mcf by a gas
cost adjustment factor expressed as an amount per 1000 cubic feet (Mcf)
of natural gas for changes in the intracompany city gate rate charge as
authorized by the State Railroad Commission or other regulatory body
having jurisdiction for gas delivered to the city distribution system,
according to division (H)(2) of this section.

adjustments according to division (H)(3) of this section.
(E) In addition to the aforesaid rates, the company shall have
the right to collect such reasonable charges as are necessary to
conduct its business and to carry out its reasonable rules and
regulations in effect. The charges set forth in divisions (H)(5) and
(6) of this section are approved. Services for which no charge is set
out may be performed and charged for by the company at a level
established by the normal forces of competition.
(F) In addition to the aforesaid rates, the Company is authorized
to recover the current and any unrecovered prior rate case expense
through a surcharge designed for a six-month nominal recovery period.
The surcharge per Mcf will be calculated by dividing the rate case
expense to be recovered by one-half of the adjusted annual sales volume
to residential and commercial customers. The Company will provide
monthly status reports to the city to account for the collection of
rate case expense.
(G) The rates set forth in this section may be changed and
amended by either the city or the company in the manner provided by
law. Service hereunder is subject to the orders of regulatory bodies
having jurisdiction, and to the company's rules and regulations

(H) Lone Star Gas Company tariffs and schedules.
(1) Item A. Rates.
(a) Subject to applicable adjustments, the following
rates are the maximum applicable to residential and commercial
consumers per meter per month or for any part of a month for which gas
service is available at the same location.
l. Residential:
Customer charge $7.0000
All consumption @ 4.9700 per Mcf
If the service period is less than 28 days in a month the customer
charge is $.2857 times the number of days service. If the consumption
contains a portion of an Mcf, a pro rata portion of the per Mcf charge
will be made.
2. Commercial:
Customer charge $12.0000
First 20 Mcf @ 5.2700 per Mcf
Next 30 Mcf @ 4.9700 per Mcf
Over 50 Mcf @ 4.8200
If the service period is less than 28 days in a month the customer
charge is $.5000 times the number of days service. If the consumption
contains a portion of an Mcf, a pro rata portion of the per Mcf charge
will be made.
(b) Bills are due and payable when rendered and must be
paid within ten days from the monthly billing date.
(c) Residential off-peak sales discount: An off-peak
sale discount of $.25 per Mcf will apply to residential customer's
volume purchased in excess of 8 Mcf for each billing months May through
October.
(2) Item B. Gas cost adjustment.
(a) Each monthly bill at the above rates shall be
adjusted for gas cost as follows:
l. The city gate rate increase or decrease
applicable to current billing month residential and commercial sales
shall be estimated to the nearest $0.0001 per Mcf based upon:
a. The city gate rate estimated to be
applicable to volumes purchased during the current calendar month,
expressed to the nearest $0.0001 per Mcf (shown below as "Re") less
b. The base city gate rate of $4.0200 per
2005 S-17 Repl. Mcf, multiplied by
13 BURKBURNETT - NATURAL GAS  51.01
c. A volume factor of 1.0204 determined in
establishing the above rates for the distribution system as the ratio
of adjusted purchased volumes divided by adjusted sales volumes.
2. Correction of the estimated adjustment
determined by division (H)(2)(a)1. of this section shall be included as
part of the adjustment. The correcting factor (shown below as division
(H)(2)(a)1.b. of this section) shall be expressed to the nearest
$0.0001 per Mcf based upon:
a. The corrected adjustment amount based upon
the actual city gate rate, less
b. The estimated adjustment amount billed
under division (H)(2)(a)1. of this section, divided by
c. Distribution system residential and
commercial sales Mcf recorded on the company's books during the prior
year for the month that the correction is included as part of the
adjustment.
3. The adjustment determined by division
(H)(2)(a)1. and 2. of this section shall be multiplied by a tax factor
of 1.05232 to include street and alley rental and state occupation tax
due to the change in the company revenues under this gas cost
adjustment provision.
(b) In summary, the gas cost adjustment (GCA) shall be
determined to the nearest $0.0001 per Mcf by division (H)(2)(a)1.
through 3. of this section as follows:
GCA = [division (H)(2)(a)1. + division (H)(2)(a)2.] 
division (H)(2)(a)3. of this section.
GCA = [(1.0204) (Re - $4.0200) + C]  1.05232
(3) Item C.
(a) Weather normalization adjustment. Effective with
bills rendered during the October 1995 through May 1996 billing months,
and annually thereafter for the October through May billing months, the
above residential and commercial consumption rates for gas service, as
adjusted, shall be subject to a weather normalization adjustment each
billing cycle to reflect the impact of variations in the actual heating
degree days during the period included in the billing cycle from the
normal level of heating degree days during the period included in the
billing cycle. The weather normalization adjustment will be
implemented on a per Mcf basis and will be applicable to the heating
load of each customer during the period included in the billing cycle.
It will be determined separately for residential and commercial
customers based on heating degree data recorded by the Wichita Falls
2005 S-17 Repl.
 51.01 BURKBURNETT - NATURAL GAS 14
weather station. The adjustment to be made for each billing cycle will
be calculated according to the following formula:
WNA ~ NDD - ADD
 M  AHL
ADD
Where: WNA = Weather normalization adjustment
NDD = Normal heating degree days during the
period covered by the billing cycle
ADD = Actual heating degree days during the
period covered by the billing cycle
M = Weighted average margin per Mcf included
in the commodity portion of the rates
effective during the October through May
billing months
AHL = Actual heating load per customer
(b) The heating load to which the weather normalization
adjustment is to be applied for residential customers is determined by
subtracting the residential class base load from the total volume being
billed to the customer. The heating load to which the weather
normalization adjustment is to be applied for commercial customers is
determined by subtracting the base load for the customer from the total
volume being billed to the customer. The base load of a customer is
the average level of nonheating consumption.
(c) The weather normalization adjustment is subject to
a 50% limitation factor based on temperatures being 50% warmer or
colder than normal. The weather normalization adjustment will be
calculated to the nearest $.0001 per Mcf.
(4) Item D. Tax adjustment. The tax adjustment shall be an
amount equivalent to the proportionate part of any new tax, or any tax
increase or decrease, or any increase or decrease of any other
governmental imposition, rental, fee or charge (except state, county,
city and special district ad valorem taxes and taxes on net income)
levied, assessed, or imposed subsequent to July 1, 1993, upon or
allocable to the company's distribution operations, by any new or
amended law, ordinance, or contract.
(5) Item E. Schedule of service charges.
(a) Inauguration of service. In addition to the
charges and rates set out above, the company shall charge and collect
the sum of:
Schedule Charge
8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday $27.50
5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. Monday through Friday 41.25
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays 41.25

14A BURKBURNETT - NATURAL GAS  51.01
For each reconnection of gas service, where service has been
discontinued at the same premises for any reason, and for each new
inauguration of service when the billable party has changed, with the
following exceptions:
l. For a builder who uses gas temporarily during
construction or for display purposes;
2. For the first occupant of the premises;
3. Whenever gas service has been temporarily
interrupted because of system outage, service work or appliance
installation done by the company; or
4. For any reason deemed necessary for company
operations.
(b) Returned check charges. A returned check handling
charge of $13.75 is made for each check returned to the company for
reasons of nonsufficient funds, account closed, payment withheld,
invalid signature, or improper preparation.
(c) Collection charge. A charge of $7 shall be made
for each instance when it is necessary for a company employee to go to
a customer's residence or place of business in order to collect amounts
owed the company for gas service previously rendered. This charge
shall not apply if service is terminated at the time of the collection
action. This charge shall apply to only one trip on the same amount
owed.
(5) Item E. Main line extension rate. The charge for
extending mains beyond the free limit established by franchise, or any
free limit established by franchise, for bona fide residential customer
shall be the lesser of: the system-wide average cost of construction,
including all overheads, for the prior fiscal year; or the adjusted
actual cost as determined by applying the latest Handy-Whitman Index to
the 1975 actual base cost of $2.94. A bona fide residential customer
uses gas for heating and water heating, or the equivalent load thereof,
at a minimum. Residential customers other than bona fide residential
customers shall pay actual cost for main line extensions beyond the
free limit. The company shall file the calculation of such charge with
the city as soon as sufficient data is available each fiscal year.
Extension to commercial and industrial customers shall be based on
actual cost per foot.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
 52.01 POLICY, PURPOSES, AND APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.
(A) This chapter provides for prohibitions on discharges of
certain substances into the POTW of the city from all sources,
domestic, commercial, or industrial. A further purpose of this chapter
is to set forth uniform requirements for industrial dischargers into
the POTW and to enable the Control Authority to protect the public
health in conformity with all applicable state and federal laws
relating thereto.
(B) The objectives of this chapter are:
(1) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW
which will interfere with the normal operation of the POTW or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW
which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving
waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
and
(3) To improve the opportunity to recycle or reclaim the
wastewater and to dispose of, recycle, or reclaim the sludge generated
by the POTW.
(C) The regulation of discharges into the POTW under this chapter
shall be accomplished through the issuance of permits, as specified
herein, and by monitoring and inspection of facilities, according to
this chapter.

deemed necessary by the Control Authority. Samples shall be collected
in such manner as to be representative of the character and
concentration of the wastewater or waste under operating conditions.
The Control Authority shall provide the Discharger with a split set of
all discharge samples taken. The laboratory methods used in the
examination of said waste shall be Standard Methods and/or those set
forth in 40 CFR, Part 136. Regular inspections and/or sampling shall
be conducted at such times and on such schedules as may be established
by the Control Authority. Should a discharger desire that a scheduled
inspection and/or sampling be conducted at some time other than that
scheduled by the Control Authority, such inspection and/or sampling may
be conducted by the Control Authority at the expense of the discharger.

 52.42 DETERMINATION OF FLOW.
(A) The water consumption during the previous month, as
determined from the meter records of the city water department, shall
be the basis for computing the sewage flow from any discharger, unless
actual sewage flow is measured by a recording meter of a type approved
by the Control Authority. The discharger shall install and maintain
such recording meter in proper condition to accurately measure such
flow. Upon failure to do so, the water consumption shall be the basis
for computing the sewage flow.
(B) When water is contained in a product or is evaporated or is
discharged as unpolluted wastewater in an uncontaminated condition to
surface drainage (in compliance with this chapter and all state and
federal law), an application may be made for a reduction in the
computed volume of waste discharged to the POTW, provided supporting
data satisfactory to the Control Authority is furnished. Such data
shall include a flow diagram and other indication of the destination of
water supply and/or wastewater, supported by data from meters installed
on such process piping at the expense of the discharger.
(C) Any discharger who procures any part or all of his water
supply from a source or sources other than the city, any of which is
discharged into the POTW, shall install and maintain at his expense an
effluent meter and/or other flow measuring device of a type approved by
the Control Authority for the purpose of determining the proper volume
of flow to be used in computing sewer flow. Such meters or measuring
devices shall be read monthly.

justify, the Control Authority may accept reports of average and
maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The Control
Authority, taking into consideration such factors as local high or low
flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors, may
authorize the submission or said reports on months other than those
specified above.
(D) Reports of significant industrial dischargers shall contain
all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the
flow rate, the nature and concentration of the constituents, or the

placing on (or attaching to) the information, at the time it is
submitted to the Control Authority, a cover sheet, stamped or typed
legend, or other suitable form of notice employing language such as
"trade secret," "proprietary," or "company confidential." Allegedly
confidential portions of otherwise nonconfidential documents should be
clearly identified by the discharger, and may be submitted separately
to facilitate identification and handling by the Control Authority. If
the discharger desires confidential treatment only until a certain date
or until the occurrence of a certain event, the notice should so state.

RATES AND CHARGES
 52.60 RATES AND CHARGES.
Users of the City Sewer System shall be subject to the following
rates effective October 1, 2017:
(A) Residential User Charges.
(1) Residential user charges shall be calculated from the
following formula:
Monthly user charge = Base rate + $2.26 (Average water
consumption)
Where: Monthly user charge = the amount in dollars charged
for basic residential sewer services.
Base rate = $13.34
Average monthly water consumption = the average
monthly water consumption during the months of
December, January and February measured in 1,000
gallon units.
(2) Whenever an average monthly water consumption has not
yet been established, a minimum charge of $26.31 per month shall be
used.
(B) Commercial User Charges.
(1) "COMMERCIAL USER" is hereby defined for the purposes of
this section as anyone who uses water for purposes other than domestic
use.
(2) Commercial user charges shall be calculated from the
following formula:
Monthly user charge = Base rate + $2.57 (Monthly water
consumption)
Where: Monthly user charge = the amount in dollars charged
for basic commercial sewer services.
2018 S-27
33 BURKBURNETT - SEWERS  52.60
Base rate: $13.34
Monthly water consumption = the monthly water
consumption measured in 1,000 gallon units.
(3) Commercial user charges shall be calculated from the
following: Any commercial user who uses water as an ingredient in the
manufacturing process of a product shall not be required to pay a sewer
charge based on the water so incorporated into the product. Any such
industrial user shall be required to show proof, of the amount of water
used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process. The city reserves
the right to conduct such tests as it may deem necessary to determine
the amount of wastewater placed into the sanitary sewer by such user.
(C) The industrial wastewater surcharge is a reimbursement for
costs incurred by the city's wastewater treatment plant and sewer
collection system from the treatment of pollutants in excess of normal
domestic sewage discharged by industrial uses. Assessment of
surcharges does not alleviate the industrial user of the responsibility
to comply with pretreatment requirements. Consistent non-compliance by
an industrial user will result in enforcement actions as defined by
this section.
(1) Surcharges for excess Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) BOD and TSS surcharges shall be
calculated as follows:
Formulas: Surcharge for TSS = S x (S1 - Sd) x 8.34 x F
Surcharges for BOD = B x (B1 - Bd) x 8.34 x F
S = unit cost of treating ($/lb)
S1 = TSS concentration in sample (mg/L)
B = unit cost of treating BOD ($/lb)
B1 = BOD concentration sample (mg/L)
Bd = BOD plant design criteria for normal domestic sewage
= 200 mg/L (Base value from which the surcharge is calculated)
Sd = TSS plant design criteria for normal domestic sewage
= 200 mg/L (Base value from which the surcharge is calculated)
F = Discharged flow measured in millions of gallons per day (MGD) or
millions of gallons (MG)
8.34 = equivalent mass of one gallon of water measured in pounds (8.34

(2) Current Unit Cost of Treatment for TSS is $.10 per
pound; and $.08 per pounds. These values are based on an annual flow
of 478.15 million gallons, 1.533 million pounds BOD, 620 thousand
pounds TSS, at an annual O&M cost of $365,885.00.
(3) Annual Adjustment of Unit Costs. The unit costs of
treating TSS(S) and BOD(B) shall be adjusted annually to reflect
2018 S-27
 52.60 BURKBURNETT - SEWERS 34
increases or decreases in wastewater treatment costs based on the
previous year's experience as presented in the annual Auditor's Report.
In the event that major changes in the industrial base have taken place
prior to the annual review, the city may adjust the Unit Cost Rates
based on current operational data and expenditures.
(a) The Pretreatment Coordinator shall determine the
Unit Cost of treatment of BOD and TSS based on the following criteria:
Total volume of treated wastewater for fiscal year
Total mass of BOD treated for fiscal year
Total mass of TSS treated for fiscal year
Total operation and maintenance expenditures for fiscal year based on
auditor's report
(b) The following assumptions shall be used to
determine the percentage of operation and maintenance costs associated
with treatment of FLOW, BOD and TSS:
FLOW: 50% of O&M expenditures
BOD: 33% of O&M expenditures
TSS: 17% of O&M expenditures
(c) The following formulas shall be applied in
determining the unit cost of treatment:
B - 33% C
BT
S - 17% C
ST
Where:
B = Unit cost of treatment for BOD measured in dollars per pound ($/lb)
C = Total O&M of BOD expenditures for fiscal year from auditor's report
BT
= Total mass of BOD during fiscal year measured in pounds (lbs)
S = Unit cost of treatment for TSS measured in dollars per pound ($/lb)
ST = Total mass of TSS treated during fiscal year measured in pounds
(lbs)
(d) The calculated Unit Cost Rate shall be rounded to
the nearest whole cent. (Example: $0.0785 shall be rounded to $0.08)
(e) The Pretreatment Coordinator shall submit the unit
cost rate adjustments to the city and unit cost rates shall become
effective 30 days following approval by the city.
(4) Surcharges may be assessed on a daily basis providing
the industrial user's wastewater discharge is measured by a totalizing
flow meter. BOD and TSS surcharges may be assessed using the
2011 S-21
34A BURKBURNETT - SEWERS  52.63
arithmetic monthly average of the daily concentrations for each
pollutant respectively and the total flow discharged for the month.
(D) The Pretreatment Coordinator shall prepare surcharge
assessments for all industrial users on a monthly basis and shall
submit the assessment to the City Water Billing Department. The
discharger shall pay monthly in accordance with practices existing for
payment of sewer charges.
(E) The city reserves the right to assess surcharges for excess
costs of treatment for other pollutants not specified in this section.

Industrial waste charges provided for in this chapter shall be
included as a separate item on the regular bill for water and sewer
charges and shall be paid monthly in accordance with the existing
practices. Such charges will be paid at the same time that the water
charges of the persons become due. The Control Authority shall specify
in each bill the determination of the amount due for all industrial
waste charges. Payment for water services shall not be accepted
without payment also of sewer service charges.

 52.62 FAILURE TO PAY BILLS.
If a discharger's payment of its monthly bills for water and sewer
services, including any industrial waste charges, is more than 60 days
overdue, the Control Authority may disconnect all connections to the
water and sanitary sewer mains to the city. The same penalties and
charges now or hereafter provided for by the ordinances of the city for
failure to pay the bill for water service when due shall be applicable
in a like manner in case of failure to pay the established charge for
waste discharged to the sanitary sewer mains as established in  52.60.

 52.65 SEWER SERVICE FEE REQUIRED TO BE PAID; REIMBURSEMENT LIMIT.
(A) In 1961 the City Council determined that every resident that
has city sewer available will be required to pay the fee for sewer
service. Due to discrepancies in how billing was done in 1961 versus
how bills are figured presently; to clarify this situation, the City
Council decrees if sewer service is available, whether or not the
residence is hooked on to sewer, shall pay the same as if they were
connected to the city sewer.
(B) It was determined by the City Council in 1961 that it would
be the responsibility of the residence for knowing if they are hooked
on or not to the city sewer.
(C) If any residence has been paying for sewer service and
determines that sewer service was not available to the residence, then
the city shall set a two year reimbursement to funds as a limit of
repayment.

rapid deterioration of such structures or interfering with proper
treatment of sewage.
(B) Any discharger notified of a suspension of the wastewater
treatment service and/or its wastewater discharge permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the offending discharge. In the event of
a failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the Control Authority shall take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate disconnection of the discharger's sewer and/or
water service connection, to prevent of minimize damage to the POTW
system or endangerment to any individuals or the environment.
(C) In the case of emergency disconnection of service, the
Control Authority shall make reasonable attempts to notify the
discharger or user of the premises where such offending discharge is
generated before disconnecting the water or sewer service line. The
party whose service has been disconnected shall have an opportunity for
a hearing on the issue of the offending discharge and the disconnection
as soon as possible after such disconnection has taken place.
(D) The Control Authority shall reinstate the wastewater
discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment and/or water service

(Ord. 944, passed - - )
 52.90 AMENDMENTS.
The city wishing to adopt more stringent rules for its OSSF
Ordinance understands that the more stringent local rule shall take
precedence over the corresponding TCEQ requirement. Listed below are
the more stringent rules adopted by the city:
(A) A permit shall be required for all on-site sewage facilities
(OSSF) regardless of acreage, and so the exception found in 30 Tex.
Administrative Code  285.3(f)(2) shall not apply in the city limits.
(B) Permits shall not transfer automatically to a new owner upon
sale or other legal transfer of an OSSF, and so 30 Tex. Administrative
Code  285.3(a)(3) shall not apply in the city limits. Within 60 days
prior to the sale or transfer of any property on which a permitted OSSF
exists, the seller or transferor must pay an inspection fee as
established by the regulatory authority and have an inspection of the
OSSF performed by a licensed designated representative of the health
district. Only after the payment of such a fee and the conduction of an
inspection in which the OSSF is found to be compliant, does the permit
become transferable upon any sale or legal transfer which occurs within
60 days of the inspection. OSSFs for properties which transfer without
2019 S-30
40A BURKBURNETT - SEWERS  52.90
the required fee and inspection shall be deemed to be invalid, and the
new owner, buyer or transferor must pay the required fee and obtain the
inspection before operating the OSSF.
(C) Within 60 days prior to the sale or transfer of any property
on which any OSSF, including an OSSF exempt from permitting
requirements by 30 Tex. Administrative Code  285.3(f), exists, the
seller or transferor must pay an inspection fee as established by the
regulatory authority and have an inspection of the OSSF performed by a
licensed designated representative of the health district. Only after
the payment of such a fee and the conduction of an inspection in which
the OSSF is found to be compliant, does the use of the system become
transferable upon any sale or legal transfer which occurs within 60
days of the inspection. OSSFs for properties which transfer without the
required fee and inspection shall be deemed to be invalid, and the new
owner, buyer or transferor must pay the required fee and obtain the
inspection before operating the OSSF.

operation of law or amendment of the statute relating to the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of municipalities; and

which taps onto an approved water main (as those terms are defined in
these rules), and a city water meter.
(Ord. 652, passed 1-20-03)
 53.51 WATER RATES AND CHARGES.
(A) Water rates. A qualified non-city user shall pay the city for
the water metered through the user's water meter. The amount to be paid

49 BURKBURNETT - WATER  53.51
within the city limits. A qualified non-city user shall be responsible
for their own line (types and size of which are to be approved by the
city as provided in these regulations) and any loss or usage will be
paid by such user (no leak adjustments will be made).
(B) Tap fees. Any qualified non-city user desiring to tap onto
a water main shall pay the same fee schedule set out in  53.29. (See
below.) In addition, taps requiring a road crossing will be charged an
additional $150 (long service connections).

$150 to defray the city's cost of consultation and inspection with
respect to such main.
(F) Findings. The city finds that the foregoing rates and charges
are fair and reasonable, represent a fair return on the investment of
the city in the assets it uses to acquire, treat and distribute potable
water taking into account the burden placed on the city's overall water
system in supplying such out of city users and the absence of
offsetting revenues from qualified non-city users (such as ad valorem
tax revenue).

meanings assigned to them in 552.044 TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE, as amended.
(Ord. 735, passed 9-17-07; Am. Ord. 822, passed 9-17-12)
 54.02 ESTABLISHED.
The city does hereby declare under the state constitution and
 552.041 through 552.054 TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE (the "Municipal
Drainage Utility Systems Act") as such act is adopted and amended, from
time to time, that the drainage system of the city shall be a public
utility. Pursuant to the provisions of TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE  552.046,
the city incorporates its existing drainage facilities, materials, and
supplies into the system.
(Ord. 735, passed 9-17-07; Am. Ord. 822, passed 9-17-12)
 54.03 ADOPTION OF SYSTEM.
(A) The Board of Commissioners of the city finds that the city
shall establish a schedule of charges against all eligible real
property in the proposed service area.
(B) The Board of Commissioners of the city finds that the city
will provide drainage for all eligible real property in the service
area subject to charges under Chapter 552 of the TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE
upon payment of drainage charges, unless exempted in this chapter.

(Ord. 735, passed 9-17-07; Am. Ord. 822, passed 9-17-12)
 54.04 SCHEDULE OF CHARGES.
(A) The schedule of charges under this chapter is based on
studies, staff review, and the projects and work program approved by
2013 S-23
55 BURKBURNETT - STORMWATER DRAINAGE  54.04
UTILITY SYSTEM
the Board of Commissioners. Future revisions will be made only after a
separate hearing has been held with notices properly published.
(B) The schedule of charges is based on a methodology that is
nondiscriminatory, reasonable, and equitable. The properties are
established as a class unless individual calculation is believed to be
necessary. The source of the impervious area data is the city and the
stormwater runoff factors are based on engineering quantifications. The
fee for all properties is computed using the same formula, which places
all properties on the basis of a single-family living unit equivalent
(SFLUE).
(1) A SFLUE is defined as the impervious area of an average
residential lot which is 3,500 square feet.
(2) The minimum monthly drainage utility system fee for a
nonresidential piece of property is four dollars. An additional $4 fee
will be charged for each additional SFLUE. Each SFLUE is treated as a
whole. If a nonresidential piece of property has impervious cover
greater than 3,500 square feet but less than 7,000 square feet, the fee
will be $8 per month.
(3) Applied to a nonresidential piece of property with an
impervious area of 31,600 square feet, the drainage utility system fee
would be $40, computed as follows: 31,600 square feet impervious;
31,600 square feet of impervious area divided by 3,500 square feet of
impervious area per SFLUE; = ten SFLUEs times four dollars per SFLUE;
= $40 per month.
(4) The fee schedule is applied with the following results:
(a) For single-family residential, condominiums and
townhome classifications: four dollars per month per utility customer.
(b) For nonresidential: The fee will be based on the
impervious land area of the property as determined by the city if the
water service is provided through master meters. In the case of
multiple master meters, the sum of the drainage charges for the entire
property may be placed on the same utility bill.

(C) All-weather surfaces: The drainage utility service fee for
any portion of a lot which consists of an all-weather surface shall be
computed at one-half of the rate that would be applicable to an
impervious surface area. For purposes of this section an "ALL-WEATHER
SURFACE" shall mean a surface used for pedestrian or vehicle traffic or
vehicle or equipment storage or parking which is not paved with
concrete, asphalt or other paving material determined by the city to be
impervious.

governmental entities: the State of Texas, Wichita County or the
Burkburnett Independent School District.
(B) Property which is required to be exempted from this chapter
pursuant to  552.053(c) TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE, as amended.
(Ord. 735, passed 9-17-07; Am. Ord. 822, passed 9-17-12)
 54.06 BILLING, DEPOSITS AND EXPENDITURES.
(A) The city will bill for drainage services on the monthly
utility bill along with water, sewer and solid waste services.
(B) There will be no separate deposit required by utility
customers.
(C) In the case of a delinquent payment of the monthly utility
bill, which includes the drainage charge, the city is authorized by
 552.050 TEX. LOC. GOVT. CODE and by this chapter to discontinue
service of all city utilities for nonpayment, even if the amount in
dispute is the drainage charge component of the monthly utility bill.
(D) The city shall identify and separate all drainage utility
income.
(E) The monies received from utility drainage charges shall be
used only for purposes that are directly or indirectly related to the
utility drainage system, as provided by law, including those costs of
service defined in  54.01 above.

 54.07 APPEALS.
(A) Disputes regarding the administration of drainage system
shall be determined, in the first instance, by the city's Public Works
Director. Any person disputing the decision of the Public Works
Director may appeal the decision of the Public Works Director to the
City Manager by compliance with the following procedures:
(1) The disputing party must deliver a written notice of
appeal to the City Manager and the Public Works Director within ten

develop forms for use in such appeals and, if such forms have been
developed, then the disputing party must use those forms in prosecuting
their appeal.
(2) The City Manager shall sustain the decision of the
Public Works Director if there is substantial evidence to support the
decision. The City Manager may reverse or modify the decision of the
Public Works Director if the City Manager determines:
(a) That the decision of the Public Works Director does
not comply with this chapter or the Municipal Drainage Utility Systems
Act, as amended; or
(b) That an error was made with regard to the category
of land development, the area of imperviousness of the land development
or the size of the developed property; or
(c) That the property is unimproved and therefore not
subject to the stormwater drainage utility system fee.
(B) The City Manager shall render a written decision on such
appeals within 30 days after receiving a written notice of appeal from
the land owner. All such decisions by the City Manager shall be final.

(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
1993 S-5
 92.26 BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION 20
 92.26 RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
If during the course of the grantee's construction, operation, or

payment in advance; and
(B) The grantee is given not less than ten business days advance
written notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.29 TRIMMING OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY.
The grantee shall have the authority to trim trees or other
natural growth overhanging any of its cable system in the service area
so as to prevent branches from coming in contact with the grantee's
wires, cables, or other equipment. The grantee shall be permitted to
charge persons who own, or are responsible for, such trees or natural
growth for the cost of such trimming, provided that similar charges are
assessed by and paid to the utilities or the franchising authority for
tree trimming. The grantee shall reasonably compensate the franchising
authority or property owner for any damages caused by such trimming,
or shall, in its sole discretion and at its own cost and expense,
reasonably replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any
1993 S-5
21 BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION  92.32
construction of the System undertaken by grantee. Such replacement
shall satisfy any and all obligations the grantee may have to the
franchising authority or property owner pursuant to the terms of this
subchapter.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.30 USE OF GRANTEE'S EQUIPMENT BY FRANCHISING AUTHORITY.
Subject to any applicable state or federal regulations or tariffs,
the franchising authority shall have the right to make additional use,
for any public purpose, of any poles or conduits controlled or
maintained exclusively by or for the grantee in any public way;
provided that:
(A) Such use by the franchising authority does not interfere with
a current or future use by the grantee;
(B) The franchising authority holds the grantee harmless against
and from all claims, demands, costs, or liabilities of every kind and
nature whatsoever arising out of such use of said poles or conduits,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs;
and
(C) At the grantee's sole discretion, the franchising authority
may be required either to pay a reasonable rental fee or otherwise
reasonably compensate the grantee for the use of such poles, conduits,
or equipment; provided, however, that the grantee agrees that such
compensation or charge shall not exceed those paid by it to public
utilities pursuant to the applicable pole attachment agreement, or
other authorization, relating to the service area.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.31 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
Construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system
shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work
shall be performed in substantial accordance with applicable FCC or
other federal, state, and local regulations. The cable system shall not
unreasonably endanger or interfere with the safety of persons or
property in the service area.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.32 AERIAL AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION.
In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission
or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing
telephone communications and electric services are underground, the
grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities underground; provided that
such facilities are actually capable of receiving the grantee's cable
and other equipment without technical degradation of the cable system's
signal quality. In those areas of the service area where the
transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public
utilities providing telephone communications, and electric services are
1993 S-5
 92.33 BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION 22
both aerial and underground, the grantee shall have the sole discretion
to construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities, or any part thereof, aerially or underground.
Nothing contained in this section shall require the grantee to
construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted
appurtenances such as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive
devices (splitters, directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies,
pedestals, or other related equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this section, in the event that all of the
transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public
utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are
placed underground after the effective date of this chapter, the
grantee shall only be required to construct, operate, and maintain all
of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if it is
given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities' facilities
at the time that such are placed underground.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.33 REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
The cable system, as constructed as of the date of the passage and
final adoption of this chapter, substantially complies with the
material provisions hereof. The grantee is hereby authorized to extend
the cable system as necessary, as desirable, or as required pursuant to
the terms hereof within the service area. Whenever the grantee shall
receive a request for service from at least 15 subscribers within 1,320
cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or
distribution cable, it shall extend its cable system to such
subscribers at no cost to the subscribers for system extension, other
than the usual connection fees for all subscribers; provided that such
extension is technically feasible, and if it will not adversely affect
the operation, financial condition, or market development of the cable
system, or as provided for under  92.34.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.34 SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for
unusual circumstances, such as a subscriber's request to locate his
cable drop underground, existence of more than 150 feet of distance
from distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers, or a
density of less than 15 subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet
of trunk or distribution cable, cable service or other service may be
made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of
construction, including cost of material, labor, and easements. For the
purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of
construction to be borne by grantee and subscribers in the area in
which cable service may be expanded, the grantee will contribute an
amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied
by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential
subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or
distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 15 subscribers.
Potential subscribers will bear the remainder of the construction and
1993 S-5
22A BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION  92.45
other costs on a pro rata basis. The grantee may require that the
payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by
such potential subscribers be paid in advance.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.35 SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDING.
The grantee shall provide without charge one outlet of basic
service to the franchising authority's office building(s), fire
station(s), police station(s), and public school building(s) that are
passed by the grantee's cable system. The outlets of basic service
shall not be used to distribute or sell cable services in or throughout
such buildings; nor shall such outlets be located in common or public
areas open to the public. Users of such outlets shall hold the grantee
harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use
of such outlets, including but not limited to, those arising from
copyright liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this section, the grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet
to such buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to said
buildings or premises exceeds 150 cable feet, unless it is technically
feasible and so long as it will not adversely affect the operation,
financial condition, or market development of the cable system to do
so, or unless the appropriate governmental entity agrees to pay the
incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 cable feet. In the
event that additional outlets of basic service are provided to such
buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation fees
associated therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and
materials. Upon request of the grantee, the building owner may also be
required to pay the service fees associated with the provision of basic
service and the additional outlets relating thereto.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.36 EMERGENCY OVERRIDE.
In the case of any emergency or disaster, the grantee shall, upon
request of the franchising authority, make available its facilities for
the franchising authority to provide emergency information and
instructions during the emergency or disaster period. The franchising
authority shall hold the grantee, its agents, employees, officers, and
assigns hereunder, harmless from any claims arising out of the
emergency use of its facilities by the franchising authority,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)

REGULATION
 92.45 FRANCHISE FEE.
(A) The grantee shall pay to the franchising authority a
franchise fee equal to 5% of gross revenues received by the grantee
from the operations of the cable system on an annual basis; provided,
however, that the grantee may credit against any such payments:
1993 S-5
 92.46 BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION 22B
(1) Any tax, fee, or assessment of any kind imposed by
franchising authority or other governmental entity on a cable operator,
or subscriber, or both, solely because of their status as such; and
(2) Tax, fee or assessment of general applicability which is
unduly discriminatory against cable operators or subscribers (including
any such tax, fee, or assessment imposed, both on utilities and cable
operators and their services).
(B) For the purpose of this section, the 12-month period
applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee
shall be a calendar year, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
franchising authority and grantee. The franchise fee payment shall be
due and payable 90 days after the close of the preceding calendar year.
Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report from a
representative of the grantee showing the basis for the computation.
(C) In the event the maximum allowable franchise fee is increased
by law, the franchise authority may request an increase up to an amount
equal to the maximum allowed by law. However, prior to the grantee
having the obligation to pay that fee, the grantee must be notified in
writing 90 days prior to that obligation occurring. The grantee has
the right to pass through to the subscriber the franchise fee.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.46 LIMITATION ON FRANCHISE FEE ACTIONS.
The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable
hereunder shall be five years from the date on which payment by the
grantee is due. Unless within five years from and after said payment
due date the franchising authority initiates a lawsuit for recovery of
such franchise fees in a court of competent jurisdiction, such recovery
shall be barred and the franchising authority shall be estopped from
asserting any claims whatsoever against the grantee relating to any
such alleged deficiencies.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.47 RATES AND CHARGES.
The franchising authority may not regulate the rates for the
provision of cable service and other services, including, but not
limited to, ancillary charges relating thereto, except as expressly
provided herein and except as authorized pursuant to federal and state
law including, but not limited to, the Cable Act and FCC Rules and
Regulations relating thereto. From time to time, and at any time, the
grantee has the right to modify its rates and charges including, but
not limited to, the implementation of additional charges and rates;
provided, however, that the grantee shall give notice to the
franchising authority of any such modifications or additional charges
30 days prior to the effective date thereof.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
1993 S-5
22C BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION  92.49
 92.48 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.
(A) The franchising authority and the grantee agree that any
proceedings undertaken by the franchising authority that relate to the
renewal of the grantee's franchise shall be governed by and comply with
the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act (as such existed as of
the effective date of the Cable Act), unless the procedures and
substantive protections set forth therein shall be deemed to be
preempted and superseded by the provisions of any subsequent provision
of federal or state law.
(B) In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section
626(a), the franchising authority agrees to notify the grantee of its
preliminary assessments regarding the identity of future cable- related
community needs and interests, as well as, the past performance of the
grantee under the then current franchise term. The franchising
authority further agrees that such a preliminary assessment shall be
provided to the grantee prior to the time that the four month period
referred to in Subsection (c) of Section 626 is considered to begin.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the
grantee and franchising authority agree that at any time during the
term of the then current franchise, while affording the public
appropriate notice and opportunity to comment, the franchising
authority and grantee may agree to undertake and finalize negotiations
regarding renewal of the then current franchise and the franchising
authority may grant a renewal thereof. The grantee and the franchising
authority consider the terms set forth in this section to be consistent
with the express provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.49 CONDITIONS OF SALE.
(A) Except to the extent expressly required by federal or state
law, if a renewal or extension of the grantee's franchise is denied or
the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the franchising authority
either lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its
actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of or by its actions
lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another
party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at a fair market
value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going
concern.
(B) The grantee and franchising authority agree that in the case
of a lawful revocation of the franchise, at the grantee's request,
which shall be made in its sole discretion, the grantee shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its cable system
to a qualified third party. The franchising authority further agrees
that during such a period of time, it shall authorize the grantee to
continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise;
however, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time
greater than six months from the effective date of such revocation.
If, at the end of that time, the grantee is unsuccessful in procuring
a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is
reasonably acceptable to the franchising authority, the grantee and
1993 S-5
 92.50 BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION 22D
franchising authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have
pursuant to federal or state law; it being further agreed that the
grantee's continued operation of its cable system during the six month
period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of,
any rights of either the franchising authority or the grantee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section,
neither the franchising authority nor the grantee shall be required to
violate federal or state law.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.50 TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.
The grantee's right, title, or interest in the franchise shall not
be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to
an affiliate, without the prior consent of the franchising authority,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be
required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other
hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of
the grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure
indebtedness.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING
 92.55 TESTING FOR COMPLIANCE.
The grantee shall comply with FCC mandated rules and regulations
regarding technical and customer service standards. The franchising
authority may perform technical tests of the cable system during
reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere
with the normal business operations of the grantee or the cable system
in order to determine whether or not the grantee is in compliance with
the terms hereof and applicable state or federal laws. Except in
emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only after giving
the grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two business
days, and providing a representative of the grantee an opportunity to
be present during such tests. In the event that such testing
demonstrates that the grantee has substantially failed to comply with
a material requirement hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall
be borne by the grantee. In the event that such testing demonstrates
that the grantee has substantially complied with such material
provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall be borne by the
franchising authority. Except in emergency circumstances, the
franchising authority agrees that such testing shall be undertaken no
more than two times a year in the aggregate, and that the results
thereof shall be made available to the grantee upon the grantee's
request.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.56 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
The grantee agrees that the franchising authority may review such
of its books and records, during normal business hours and on a
nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to monitor compliance
1993 S-5
22E BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION  92.67
with the terms hereof. Such records shall include, but shall not be
limited to, any public records required to be kept by the grantee
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, the grantee shall not be
required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be
proprietary or confidential in nature. The franchising authority
agrees to treat any information disclosed by the grantee to it as
confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and
agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the
provisions hereof.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
INSURANCE
 92.65 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
The grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own
cost and expense, during the term of the franchise, Comprehensive
General Liability Insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 combined single
limit for bodily injury, and property damage. Said insurance shall
designate the franchising authority as an additional insured. Such
insurance shall be noncancellable except upon 30 days prior written
notice to the franchising authority.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.66 INDEMNIFICATION.
The grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless, and
defend the franchising authority, its officers, boards and employees,
from and against any liability for damages and for any liability or
claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury (including
accidental death), which arise out of the grantee's construction,
operation, or maintenance of its cable system, including, but not
limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.67 BONDS AND OTHER SURETY.
Except as expressly provided herein, the grantee shall not be
required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of
being awarded the franchise or continuing its existence. The
franchising authority acknowledges that the legal, financial, and
technical qualifications of the grantee are sufficient to afford
compliance with the terms of the franchise and the enforcement thereof.
The grantee and franchising authority recognize that the costs
associated with bonds and other surety may ultimately be borne by the
subscribers in the form of increased rates for cable services. In order
to minimize such costs, the franchising authority agrees to require
bonds and other surety only in such amounts and during such times as
there is a reasonably demonstrated need therefor. The franchising
authority agrees that in no event, however, shall it require a bond or
other related surety in an aggregate amount greater than $10,000,
conditioned upon the substantial performance of the material terms,
covenants, and conditions of the franchise. Initially, no bond or other
1993 S-5
 92.75 BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION 22F
surety will be required. In the event that one is required in the
future, the franchising authority agrees to give the grantee at least
60 days prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the
requirement. Such reason must demonstrate a change in the grantee's
legal, financial, or technical qualifications which would materially
prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms of the
franchise or afford compliance therewith.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
ENFORCEMENT
 92.75 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
In the event that the franchising authority believes that the
grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall
notify the grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged
noncompliance.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.76 GRANTEE'S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND.
The grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice
described in  92.75:
(A) To respond to the franchising authority contesting the
assertion of noncompliance; or
(B) To cure such default; or
(C) In the event that, by the nature of default, such default
cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to
remedy such default and notify the franchising authority of the steps
being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.77 PUBLIC HEARING.
In the event that the grantee fails to respond to the notice
described in  92.75 pursuant to the procedures set forth in  92.76,
or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 60 days
after the grantee is notified of the alleged default pursuant to
 92.75, the franchising authority shall schedule a public meeting to
investigate the default. Such public meeting shall be held at the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the franchising authority which is
scheduled at a time which is no less than five business days therefrom.
The franchising authority shall notify the grantee of the time and
place of such meeting and provide the grantee with an opportunity to be
heard.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
1993 S-5
22G BURKBURNETT - CABLE TELEVISION  92.80
 92.78 ENFORCEMENT.
(A) Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the
franchising authority, after such meeting, determines that the grantee
is in default of any provision of the franchise, the franchising
authority may:
(1) Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided
under this franchise, if any, including without limitation, any bonds
or other surety; provided, however, the foreclosure shall only be in
such a manner and in such amount as the franchising authority
reasonably determines is necessary to remedy the default;
(2) Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek
other equitable relief;
(3) In the case of a substantial default of a material
provision of the franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be
revoked; or
(4) Seek specific performance of any provision, which
reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages.
(B) The grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations
to comply promptly with any provision of the franchise by reason of any
failure of the franchising authority to enforce prompt compliance.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.79 ACTS OF GOD.
The grantee shall not be held in default or noncompliance with the
provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty
relating thereto, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are
caused by strikes, acts of God, power outages, or other events
reasonably beyond its ability to control.
(Ord. 501, passed 4-19-93)
 92.80 UNAUTHORIZED RECEPTION.
In addition to those criminal and civil remedies provided by state
and federal law, it shall be a misdemeanor for any person, firm, or
corporation to create or make use of any unauthorized connection,
whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or
otherwise, with any part of the cable system without the express
consent of the grantee. Further, without the express consent of the
grantee, it shall be a misdemeanor for any person to tamper with,
remove, or injure any property, equipment, or part of the cable system
or any means of receiving cable service or other services provided
thereto. Subject to applicable federal and state law, the franchising
authority shall incorporate into its criminal code, if not presently a
part thereof, criminal misdemeanor law which will enforce the intent of
this section.

shall contain a minimum sanitary concentration equivalent to a free
chlorine residual of 3.0 - 8.0 ppm minimum. If an aquatic facility is
outside the required range of free chlorine residual equivalent, then
the aquatic facility shall be immediately closed to the public. A test
kit for measuring the concentration of the free chlorine shall be
present at each aquatic facility. The regulatory authority must approve
use of any sanitizer other than chlorine.
(2) Every aquatic facility shall have water with a pH of not
less than 7.2 and not more than 7.8. An adequate pH test kit shall be

68A BURKBURNETT - REGULATION OF PUBLIC POOLS  100.07
(4) Every aquatic facility shall have water clarity
sufficient for the main drain or a six-inch diameter turbidity test
disk placed at the deepest part of the aquatic facility, to be visible
from the sidewalks of the aquatic facility at all distances up to ten
yards, measured from a line drawn across the pool through the disc.
Failure to meet this requirement shall be sufficient cause for
immediate closure of the aquatic facility.
(5) A 15-minute maximum timer will be installed and
operational at each spa. The timer must be located so that it cannot be
reached unless a person exits the spa.

authority is required to close the pool for non-compliance, a
re-inspection fee may be charged to the permit holder for each
requested return visit for re-inspection
(Ord. 781, passed 5-17-10; Am. Ord. 948, passed 5-30-19)
 100.07 REGULATIONS IN POOL AND SPA AREA; SUSPENSION OF PERMIT.
(A) A person commits an offense if he or she violates any portion
of this chapter or the standards set forth by the State Department of
Health.
(B) Failure to comply with any section of this chapter may result
in the immediate closure of the aquatic facility and/or the initiation
of legal action. Upon determination that the aquatic facility does not
comply with the provisions of this chapter, the regulatory authority
shall notify the permit holder or Manager of Operations of the existing
violations. If the regulatory authority determines that the condition
of the aquatic facility may be hazardous to the health or safety of the
swimmers or the general public, the aquatic facility shall be
immediately closed. A new water sample and inspection of the aquatic
facility will be conducted from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., Monday through
Thursday at the request of the pool Manager of Operations or the permit
holder. The aquatic facility water must completely turnover through the
filtration and chlorination system at least once before reinspection
and resampling. If compliance has been achieved, the permit holder
shall be notified that the aquatic facility may be opened.
(C) When the regulatory authority has ordered that an aquatic
facility be closed due to noncompliance with any provision of this
chapter, the permit holder shall not allow the aquatic facility to be
used for swimming, diving or bathing purposes and shall immediately
take every reasonable step to prevent the use of such aquatic facility
for such purposes. By way of example and without limiting such duty,
the permit holder shall immediately:
(1) Post notices reasonably likely to come to the attention
of potential users of the pool or spa advising of the closure;
2019 S-30
 100.08 BURKBURNETT - REGULATION OF PUBLIC POOLS 68B
(2) Lock all gates and doorways in any fence or other
enclosure surrounding such pool; and
(3) Failure to immediately comply with the above will result
in the regulatory authority posting a sign at the pool, which states,
"Pool Closed by Order of the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health
District." It shall be unlawful to remove, cover, or mutilate such sign
without the approval of the regulatory authority. Use of the aquatic
facility by an individual for swimming, diving or bathing purposes
after the regulatory authority has ordered such aquatic facility to be
closed shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the permit holder of
such aquatic facility has knowingly allowed the aquatic facility to be
used for such purposes.
(D) The regulatory authority shall suspend a permit to operate a
public pool or spa if:
(1) A permit holder fails to designate a certified Manager
of Operations as specified in this chapter;
(2) The condition or operation of a pool or spa is
considered to be hazardous or constitutes an imminent health hazard to
the health or safety of swimmers or the general public;
(3) The permit holder fails to keep all spa equipment and
devices working properly; or

 113.01 PURPOSE.
Minors who do not have the consent of their parents are
prohibited, by state law, from obtaining a tattoo or body piercing.
Location of body art establishments near areas frequented by minors
would significantly increase the burden on law enforcement
authorities in the interdiction of violations of the state law.
Moreover, the location of body art establishments affects the value
of property in the area where a studio is located. The following
sections regulate the establishment and location of body art
establishments to promote the health, safety and general welfare of
the citizens of the city. Further, periodic inspections of body art
establishments authorized by the city to insure compliance with state
law is a legitimate law enforcement endeavor to promote the general
health and welfare of the citizens of the city.

successor agency) pursuant to the authority granted under Chapter 146
of the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event of any conflict

GENERAL PROVISIONS
 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control
Insurance Act, Texas Water Code,  16.315, delegated the responsibility
of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize
flood losses.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
2011 S-21 33
 152.02 BURKBURNETT - FLOOD DAMAGE PROTECTION 34
 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
(A) The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all
of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(B) These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights
and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood
damage.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(A) Protect human life and health;
(B) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
(C) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(D) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(E) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in floodplains;
(F) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize
future flood blight areas; and
(G) Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in
a flood area.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
 152.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the
following methods:
2011 S-21
35 BURKBURNETT - FLOOD DAMAGE PROTECTION  152.05
(A) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety
or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities;
(B) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(C) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the
accommodation of flood waters;
(D) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase flood damage;
(E) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood
hazards to other lands.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)

in  152.22(B) of this chapter (Permit Procedures) have been fully
2011 S-21
47 BURKBURNETT - FLOOD DAMAGE PROTECTION  152.23
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(G) Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of
this Chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this chapter (as stated in  152.03 of this chapter,
Statement of Purpose).

any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(I) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation
as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(J) Prerequisites for granting variances:
(1) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to
afford relief.
(2) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) Showing a good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will
not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(3) Any application to which a variance is granted shall be
given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built
with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(K) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that

(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
 152.33 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in
 152.07 of this chapter (Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special
Flood Hazard), are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas
have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three
feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of
flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the
following provisions apply:
(A) All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest
adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified).
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements of
non-residential structures:
(a) Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to
two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade
at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the
community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified);
or
(b) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities
be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone,
or below the Base Flood Elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water
and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
(3) A registered professional engineer or architect shall
submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the
standards of this section, as proposed in  152.42 of this chapter
(Permit Procedures) are satisfied.
2011 S-21
53 BURKBURNETT - FLOOD DAMAGE PROTECTION  152.99
(4) Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from
proposed structures.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
 152.34 FLOODWAYS.
Floodways, located within areas of special flood hazard established
in  152.07 of this chapter (Basis for Establishing the Areas of
Special Flood Hazard), are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood
waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential,
the following provisions shall apply:
(A) Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development within the adopted
regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in
any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence
of the base flood discharge.
(B) If division (A) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of  152.30 through 152.34 (Provisions for Flood
Hazard Reduction).
(C) Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1,  65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit
encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result
in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community
first completes all of the provisions required by 44 C.F.R.  65.12.
(Ord. 773, passed 1-18-10)
 152.99 PENALTY.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located,
extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms
of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the
provisions of this court order by failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Chapter or fails to comply
with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not
more than $500 for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs
and expenses involved in the case. Each day a violation occurs is a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy
any violation.

TOWNHOUSE AND CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT
 155.75 PURPOSE.
(A) Because of the newness of townhouses, condominiums, cluster
houses and other such housing concepts in the city, and because such
housing does not fall into any existing residential subdivision, the
city finds that a set of guidelines are necessary to set forth the
city's policy and attitudes towards these housing types. The city does
encourage new and creative ideas when such ideas are in the best
interest of the city as a whole, therefore, each proposed development
must be reviewed individually and judged on its merits. In order to
provide for individual review it has been decided that all townhouses,
condominiums, cluster housing and other such concepts shall be allowed
only under Planned Development.
(B) In approving a townhouse project, the city shall assure itself
that the project meets the following conditions:
(1) That property adjacent to the area included in the project
shall not be adversely affected.
(2) That the lots or area within the project shall be used only
for single-family dwellings and uses commonly accessory thereto such as
garages, carports, or storage areas.
(3) That the project is consistent with the intent and purpose
to promote health, safety, morals, and general welfare.
1993 S-5
 155.76 BURKBURNETT - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 90
(B) This type of subdivision requires "a comprehensive site plan"
and that the site plan and chapter "shall set forth" various
requirements, therefore, the guidelines of this subchapter are given to
show what is expected in regard to these various requirements.
(Ord. 505, passed 5-17-93)
 155.76 DEFINITIONS.
For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
"CONDOMINIUM STRUCTURE." Four or more condominium apartments each
having a width of not less than 18 feet in a single building.
"TOWNHOUSE." A structure on an individual lot, which is one of a
series of dwelling units designed for single-family occupancy, which
dwelling units are structurally connected or immediately adjacent to
and abutting each other without side yards between individual dwelling
units. A "condominium apartment" (as defined in Article 1301a,
V.A.T.S.) in a "condominium structure" may be considered a townhouse if
no other dwelling unit or use of any kind exists immediately above or
below it.
"TOWNHOUSE PROJECT." A development consisting of not less than one
acre of land having not less than 100 feet of continuous frontage on an
access street or and interior street and not less than four townhouses.
(Ord. 505, passed 5-17-93)
 155.77 GENERAL LOCATION.
Each application shall be judged on its appropriateness to its site
and to its compatibility with existing development or other proposed
development. It is felt that through proper planning it is possible to
design townhouse development to fit most areas of the city. This is not
to say that such a plan is economically feasible.
(Ord. 505, passed 5-17-93)
 155.78 COMPREHENSIVE SITE PLAN.
(A) The Comprehensive Site Plan is to be a graphic plan including
all of the area under consideration for city approval and shall be
submitted with the application. This plan need not be detailed but must
show:
(1) Use areas;
(2) Land areas for building, principal roadways, parkways,
buffers, screenings; and
(3) Number and type of dwelling units.
(B) Notes, sketches, photographs and drawings may be attached to the
development plan to illustrate the intent of treatment of parkways,
auto parking areas, buffer strips, screening and shrubs, roadway
design,
1993 S-5
91 BURKBURNETT - SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS  155.80
special subdivision lotting plans and other such ideas which cannot be
satisfactorily explained otherwise. Such notes, sketches, photographs,
and drawings shall be used to evaluate detailed site plans. If the
Comprehensive Site Plan is only conceptual in nature, no building
permit shall be issued until a Detailed Site Plan is approved by the
City Council.
(Ord. 505, passed 5-17-93)
 155.79 DETAILED SITE PLAN.
(A) A Detailed Site Plan shall be approved prior to issuance of a
building and shall show:
(1) Locations of buildings or building complexes, open spaces,
parking area, drives, streets and other access ways, fire lanes,
landscaping (in general only), walls and fences, buffer strips;
(2) Use of buildings;
(3) Number of dwelling units;
(4) Lotting plans if applicable;
(5) Diagrammatic utility layouts; and
(6) Other such things which serve to show that the proposed
development will be compatible with the surrounding area and will
provide a wholesome environment for future residents.
(B) The site plan may be composed of several sheets and may include
photographs and sketches if necessary.
(C) The Detailed Site Plan and the Comprehensive Site Plan may be
one-in-the-same if all conditions of both are met. In the event of a
Multi-Phase Project, it is intended that a Detailed Site Plan be
submitted only on the area that is proposed for immediate development.
Additional plans may be approved as additional phases are ready to be
developed. All Detailed Site Plans shall be in general conformance with
the Comprehensive Site Plan and applications for building permits will
be reviewed based on the Detailed Site Plan.
(Ord. 505, passed 5-17-93)

SECTION 2 TITLE AND PURPOSE
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the City of Burkburnetts Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Ordinance, and is also sometimes referred to herein as this Ordinance.
As authorized by Chapter 211 of the Texas Local Government Code, the zoning regulations and districts as herein established have been made in accordance with an adopted comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, morals and general welfare, and protecting and preserving places and areas of historical, cultural and/or architectural importance and significance within the City. They have been designed to lessen the congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to ensure adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land and thus avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, wastewater treatment, schools, parks and other public requirements. They have been made with reasonable consideration, among other things, for the character of each zoning district and its peculiar suitability for the particular uses specified; and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the City.
SECTION 3 ZONING DISTRICT MAP
The City is hereby divided into zones, or districts, and the boundaries of zoning districts set out herein are delineated upon the Zoning District Map of the City, which may also be cited as the Zoning Map, said map being adopted as a part of this Ordinance as fully as if the same were set forth herein in detail.
3.1 One original of the Zoning District Map shall be filed in the office of the City Secretary and labeled as Zoning Map of the City of Burkburnett, Texas -- Ordinance #589. This copy shall be the official Zoning District Map and shall bear the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City Secretary, and shall bear the seal of the City under the following words: This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in Section 3 of the Zoning Ordinance, Ordinance #589 of the City of Burkburnett, Texas, adopted on the 17th day of April, 2000". This copy shall not be changed in any manner. In case of any question, this copy, together with amending ordinances, shall be controlling.
3.2 A copy of the original Zoning District Map shall be placed in the office of the City Manager, or his/her designee. The map copy shall be used for reference and shall be maintained up-to-date by posting thereon all subsequent amendments. Reproductions for informational purposes may only be made of the official Zoning District Map or this copy.
Any changes/amendments made to the zoning district boundaries shall be made on the map copy promptly after the amendment has been approved by the Board of Commissioners, together with a descriptive entry on the map as follows: On the following date(s), by official action of the Board of Commissioners of Burkburnett, Texas, the following change(s) was made on the Citys official Zoning District Map: (enter the amending ordinance number, the adoption date, and a brief description of the nature of the map revision). The descriptive entry shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the City Secretary.

SECTION 4 ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
4.1 The zoning district boundary lines shown on the Zoning District Map are usually along streets, alleys, property lines, or extensions thereof. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Zoning District Map, the following rules shall apply:
A. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerline.
B. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines.
C. Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be construed as following City limits.
D. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the right-of-way lines.
E. Boundaries indicated as following the centerline of creeks, streams or drainageways shall be construed to follow such centerline, and in the event of change in the centerline shall be construed to move with such centerline.
F. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated with Subsections A through E above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the Zoning District Map shall be determined by the scale of the Map.
G. Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action of the Board of Commissioners or whenever such area is franchised for building purposes, the zoning district line adjoining each side of such street, alley or other public way shall be automatically extended to the centerline of such vacated street, alley or public way and all areas so involved shall then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended districts.
H. The zoning classification applied to a tract of land adjacent to a street shall extend to the centerline of the street unless, as a condition of zoning approval, it is stated that the zoning classification shall not apply to the street.
I. Where physical features on the ground are at variance with information shown on the Zoning District Map, or if there arises a question as to how or whether a parcel of property is zoned and such question cannot be resolved by the application of Subsections A through H, or if the zoning of property is invalidated by a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, the property shall be considered classified as "AG" (Agriculture district) in the same manner as provided for newly annexed territory.

SECTION 5 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED AND APPLICATION
OF REGULATIONS
5.1 All land, buildings, structures or appurtenances thereon located within the City of Burkburnett, Texas which are hereafter occupied, used, constructed, erected, removed, placed, demolished, and/or converted shall be occupied, used, erected, altered, removed, placed, demolished and/or converted in conformance with the zoning regulations prescribed for the zoning district in which such land or building is located, as hereinafter provided, or such shall be subject to penalties as per Section 35 of this Ordinance. All of the standards and regulations prescribed herein shall be considered as the minimum requirement unless explicitly stated otherwise.
5.2 No uses shall be allowed which are prohibited by State or Federal law or which operate in excess of State or Federal environmental, pollution or performance standards as determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Texas Air Control Board (TACB), Texas State Department of Health (TSDH), The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), or any other applicable State or Federal agency, as the case may be.
5.3 No lot upon which a building has been erected shall later be so reduced in area that the setbacks, yards and/or open spaces shall be smaller than those required by this Ordinance, nor shall a part of a yard or other open space required by this Ordinance for any building/lot be included as a part of a yard or other open space similarly required for another building/lot.
5.4 No building shall hereafter be erected or altered:
A.
To have more narrow or smaller front, side or rear yards than those required by this Ordinance;
B.
To exceed the maximum height allowed by this Ordinance;
C.
To occupy a greater percentage of lot area than allowed by this Ordinance; or
D.
To accommodate or house a greater number of families than is specified within this Ordinance for the zoning district in which such building is located.
SECTION 6 ZONING UPON ANNEXATION
6.1 As soon as practical following annexation, the Board of Commissioners shall, on its own motion, initiate proceedings to establish Agricultural (AG) zoning on the newly annexed territory, thereupon the City Manager, or his/her designee, shall commence public notification and other standard procedures for zoning amendments as set forth in Section 10 of this Ordinance. Said proceedings to establish zoning may be undertaken concurrently with annexation procedures (i.e., notified at the same time, public hearings scheduled at the same time as annexation, etc.), however zoning approval and formal adoption of the ordinance establishing zoning must occur after annexation approval/adoption has occurred and as a separate and distinct action by the Board of Commissioners.
6.2 The Board of Commissioners may, upon its own motion, elect to zone newly annexed territory with a more permanent zoning classification (e.g., SF-10, SF-6, MF, C/B, etc.) than the Agricultural (AG) zoning designation upon a determination that such permanent zoning
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
5
is in conformance with the Citys adopted Comprehensive Plan, is the most appropriate zoning classification for the subject property, is in the best interest of the City of Burkburnett, and is not detrimental to adjacent property or to the public health, safety and welfare.
6.3 The initial zoning of a land parcel, whether it is interim in nature, by initiation of the landowner or by initiation of the City, must meet the requirements for notification and public hearings as set forth in Section 10 of this Ordinance and all other applicable State laws.
6.4 The owner of land to be annexed may submit an application for zoning the property simultaneously with submission of the petition for annexation, but no such annexation application may be made conditioned upon the approval of any particular zoning classification.
6.5 Within an area classified as AG (Agriculture):
A. No permit for the construction of a building or use of land shall be issued by the Building Official, or his/her designee, other than a permit which will allow the construction of a building or use permitted in the AG district, unless and until such territory has been classified in a zoning district other than the AG district by the Board of Commissioners in the manner prescribed by Section 10, except as provided in Subsection B below.
B. If plans and/or preparations for developing a property for a use other than those specified in the AG district were already in progress prior to annexation of the property into the City of Burkburnett, then the Board of Commissioners may authorize construction of the project by a majority vote. Application of this subsection is contingent upon the following:
1. An application for a building permit for the proposed building/use must be made to the Building Official of the City of Burkburnett (or his/her designee) within three (3) months after annexation of the property into the City; and
2. The applicant must be able to demonstrate that plans and other preparations for developing the property commenced prior to (i.e., were already in progress at the time of) annexation into the City.
In its deliberations concerning authorization to proceed with construction of a project which meets the above criteria, the Board of Commissioners shall take into consideration the appropriate land use for the area as shown on the City's Future Land Use Plan. Upon approval by the Board of Commissioners, the City Manager (or his/her designee) shall notify the Building Official (or his/her designee) of such approval.

II. ADMINISTRATION
SECTION 7 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
7.1 INTENT OF PROVISIONS:
A. Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments thereto, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawfully in existence and operating before this Ordinance was enacted, amended or otherwise made applicable to such lots, structures or uses, but which do not now conform to the regulations of the district in which they are located. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit such nonconforming uses to continue, as long as the conditions within this Section and other applicable sections of the Ordinance are met.
B. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that nonconforming uses and/or structures shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, and shall not be used as a basis for adding or substituting other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
C. Nonconforming uses are hereby declared to be incompatible with the permitted uses in the districts involved.
7.2 NONCONFORMING STATUS:
Any use, platted lot, or structure which does not conform with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located shall be deemed a nonconforming use, platted lot, or structure when:
A. Such use, platted lot, or structure was in existence and lawfully operating as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and has since been in regular and continuous use; or
B. Such use, platted lot, or structure was in existence and lawfully operating as of the effective date of any amendment to this Ordinance, but by such amendment is placed in a district wherein such use, platted lot, or structure is no longer permitted, and has since been in regular and continuous use; or
C. Such use, platted lot, or structure was in existence and lawfully operating at the time of annexation into the City and has since been in regular and continuous use.
7.3 CONTINUING LAWFUL USE OF PROPERTY AND EXISTENCE OF STRUCTURES:
A. The lawful use of land or lawful existence of structures as of the effective date of this Ordinance, although such do not conform to the provisions hereof, may be continued; but if said nonconforming use or structure is discontinued or abandoned, as these terms are defined in Subsection B below, any future use of said premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
8
B. "Discontinuance" of a nonconforming use shall be defined as the actual act or date that the use is discontinued (i.e., ceases to operate on the subject property). "Abandonment" of a nonconforming use or structure shall be defined as the actual act or date of abandonment as described in Subsection C.
C. When a nonconforming use or structure which does not meet the development standards in this Ordinance ceases to be used in such manner as stated in Subsection B above for a time period of six (6) months or longer, such use shall not be resumed and proof of such event shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of abandonment, except as allowed in Subsection 7.5(E). Any nonconforming use which does not involve a permanent type of structure or operation and which is moved from the premises shall be considered to have been abandoned.
D. No nonconforming use or structure may be expanded, re-occupied with another nonconforming use, or increased following the effective date of this Ordinance except as provided in Section 7.5.
E. Conforming single-family residential uses on platted lots which were approved prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, which may now be nonconforming due to stricter standards, shall be deemed in conformance with this Ordinance as long as the use of the lot is allowed in the respective district. Only the lot size, depth, setbacks and width shall be allowed to be less than the regulations prescribed in the zoning district in which it is located. All other regulations of this Ordinance shall be met or the lot shall be considered nonconforming.
F. Any existing vacant lot platted prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, which was legally conforming, shall be deemed a conforming lot.
G. Maintenance and upkeep of the nonconforming use/structure is permitted (i.e., painting, etc.).
7.4 CHANGING NONCONFORMING LAND USES AND STRUCTURES:
A. Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use, and once such change is made, the use shall not be changed back to a nonconforming use.
B. Where a conforming use is located in a nonconforming structure, the use may be changed to another conforming use by the process outlined in Section 7.5 below.
C. A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use or structure.
7.5 EXPANSION OF NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES:
An expansion of a nonconforming use or structure is allowed in accordance with the following:
A. A nonconforming use located within a building may be extended throughout the existing building, provided that;
1. No structural alteration (except as provided in Subsection E below) may be made on or in the building except those required by law to preserve such building in a
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
9
safe and structurally sound condition.
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
10
2. The number of dwelling units or rooms in a nonconforming residential use shall not be increased so as to exceed the number of dwelling units or rooms existing at the time said use became a nonconforming use.
B. No nonconforming use within a building may be extended to occupy any land outside the building.
C. No nonconforming use of land or building shall be enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the time the land became a nonconforming use, except to provide off-street loading or off-street parking space.
D. The minimum residential lot areas for the various zoning districts shall be in accordance with their respective districts, except that a lot having less area than herein required which was an official "lot of record" prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, may be used for a single-family dwelling.
E. Buildings or structures which do not conform to the area regulations or development standards in this Ordinance, but where the uses are deemed conforming, shall not increase the gross floor area by more than ten percent (10%).
F. Buildings or structures which have been vacant or abandoned for more than six (6) months and do not meet the current area regulations or development standards shall be allowed to be re-occupied by a conforming use if Subsection E above is followed.
G. A nonconforming use may be required to provide screening such that its operations (or some portion of its operations/facility) are not visible from the street or surrounding property, may be required to eliminate any nuisance factor caused by the nonconforming use, or the nonconforming use may be eliminated itself if it is deemed detrimental or hazardous to the health, safety or welfare of nearby residents or other citizens. The Planning and Zoning Commission may, following notice and public hearing, review any of the above situations and may make an appropriate recommendation (i.e., to provide screening, to eliminate a nuisance factor, or to eliminate the nonconforming use itself) to the Board of Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners may, after appropriate notice and public hearing, make a final ruling on any of the above situations. Any unfavorable recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission may be appealed to the Board of Commissioners, whereupon a three-quarters () vote of the Board of Commissioners will be required to reverse (i.e., overrule) the Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation.
7.6 RESTORATION OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE:
A. If a structure occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by fire, the elements, or some other cause, it may not be rebuilt except to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance. In the case of partial destruction of a nonconforming structure which does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of its total appraised value as determined by the Wichita County Central Appraisal District, reconstruction will be permitted, but the previously existing square footage of the structure and/or the function of the nonconforming use cannot be expanded.
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 7.6(A) above, any property owner in a Single-Family-6 (SF-6) zoning district who owns a mobile home or manufactured home which was legally in existence on the date of adoption of this Ordinance, may replace
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
11
such structure with a HUD-Code manufactured home that is five (5) years old or newer (i.e., manufacture date is less than or equal to five years prior to the date the structure is placed on the property to replace the destroyed structure).

All administrative remedies available to the applicant shall have been exhausted prior to hearing by the Zoning Board of Adjustments.
9.6 VARIANCES:
A. The Zoning Board of Adjustments may authorize a variance from these regulations when, in its opinion, undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustments shall prescribe only conditions that it deems necessary for, or desirable to, the public interest. In making the findings hereinbelow required, the Board of Adjustments shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of the land involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, the number of persons who will reside or work within the proposed use, and the probable effect such variance will have upon traffic conditions and upon the public health, safety, convenience and welfare of the community.
B. Conditions Required for Variance - No variance shall be granted without first having given public notice and having held a public hearing on the variance request in accordance with Section 9.9 of this Ordinance and unless the Zoning Board of Adjustments finds:
1. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his/her land; and
2. That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; and
3. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
19
or welfare, or injurious to other property within the area; and
4. That the granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly use of other land within the area in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
Such findings of the Zoning Board of Adjustments, together with the specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the Board of Adjustments meeting at which such variance is granted. Variances may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance so that the public health, safety and welfare may be secured and that substantial justice may be done.
C. Findings of Undue Hardship - In order to grant a variance, the Board of Adjustments must make written findings that an undue hardship exists, using the following criteria:
1. That literal enforcement of the controls will create an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty in the development of the affected property; and
2. That the situation causing the hardship or difficulty is neither self-imposed nor generally affecting all or most properties in the same zoning district; and
3. That the relief sought will not injure the permitted use of adjacent conforming property; and
4. That the granting of a variance will be in harmony with the spirit and purpose of these regulations.
D. A variance shall not be granted to relieve a self-created or personal hardship, nor shall it be based solely upon economic gain or loss, nor shall it permit any person the privilege in developing a parcel of land not permitted by this Ordinance to other parcels of land in the particular zoning district. No variance may be granted which results in undue hardship upon another parcel of land.
E. The applicant bears the burden of proof in establishing the facts that may justify a variance.

10.5 FAILURE TO APPEAR:

10.6 PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION CONSIDERATION AND RECOMMENDATION:
A. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall function in accordance with Section 8 of this Ordinance.

SECTION 23 OVERLAY AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS
Overlay and special prefix districts shall be used in conjunction with base zoning districts where it is appropriate to do so. In the use of the following overlay zoning classifications, the base district shall remain in effect as it is already in existence unless changed by zoning amendment and in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. New base districts or changes in existing base districts may be requested at the same time overlay or special prefix districts are requested.
SECTION 24 PD -- PLANNED DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT
24.1 GENERAL PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION:
A. The Board of Commissioners of the City of Burkburnett, Texas, after public hearing and proper notice to all parties affected and after recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, may authorize the creation of a Planned Development overlay district.
B. The Planned Development (PD) district is a district which accommodates planned associations of uses developed as integral land use units such as industrial districts, office parks, retail/commercial or service centers, shopping centers, residential developments having a mixture of housing options (e.g., single-family, multi-family, duplex, etc.), or any appropriate combination of uses which may be planned, developed or operated as integral land use units either by a single owner or a combination of owners. A PD district may be used to permit new or innovative concepts in land utilization not permitted by other zoning districts in this Ordinance. While greater flexibility is given to allow special conditions or restrictions which would not otherwise allow the development to occur, procedures are established herein to ensure against misuse of increased flexibility.
24.2 PERMITTED USES:
A. An application for a PD district shall specify the base zoning district upon which the PD is based, and the use or the combination of uses proposed (particularly if any of the proposed uses are not allowed by right in the base zoning district). In selecting a base zoning district, the uses allowed in the base district must be similar or compatible with those proposed for the PD. PD designations shall not be attached to SUP requirements. Specific Use Provisions allowed in a base zoning district are allowed in a PD only if specifically identified at the time of PD approval, and if specifically cited as an additional use (i.e., to those allowed by right in the base zoning district) in the ordinance establishing the PD.
B. In the case of residential PD districts, the proposed lot sizes shall be no smaller than the lot sizes allowed in the base zoning district for each type of housing (e.g., single-family, duplex, etc.) except for minor changes in a small percentage of the lots in order to provide improved design or flexibility in the layout of the subdivision.

ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
68
24.3 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
A. Development requirements for each separate PD district shall be set forth in the amending ordinance granting the PD district and shall include, but may not be limited to: uses, density, lot area, lot width, lot depth, yard depths and widths, building height, building elevations, coverage, floor area ratio, parking, access, screening, landscaping, accessory buildings, signs, lighting, project phasing or scheduling, management associations, and other requirements as the Board of Commissioners and Planning and Zoning Commission may deem appropriate.
B. In the PD district, uses shall conform to the standards and regulations of the base zoning district to which it is most similar. The base zoning district shall be stated in the granting ordinance. All applications to the City shall list all requested deviations from the standard requirements set forth throughout this Ordinance (applications without this list will be considered incomplete). The Planned Development district shall conform to all other regulations of the base zoning district, as well as all other sections of the Zoning Ordinance, unless specifically changed or excluded in the ordinance establishing the PD.
C. The ordinance granting a PD district shall include a statement as to the purpose and intent of the PD granted therein. A specific list is required of modifications in each district or districts and general statement citing the reason for the PD request.
D. The minimum acreage for a planned development request shall be ten (10) acres.
24.4 In establishing a Planned Development district in accordance with this Section, the Board of Commissioners shall approve and file as part of the amending ordinance appropriate plans and standards for each Planned Development district. To facilitate understanding of the request during the review and public hearing process, the concurrent submission of a Concept Plan for a proposed non-residential, multi-family or manufactured (mobile) home project, or a Preliminary Plat for a proposed residential (i.e., single- or two-family) project, shall be required along with the PD zoning application. A detailed Site Plan may be submitted in lieu of the Concept Plan (or a Final Plat in lieu of the Preliminary Plat, see the Subdivision Ordinance for submission requirements) if the applicant prefers to do so, and if the applicant wishes to expend the resources/funds necessary to prepare a complete detailed Site Plan (or Final Plat) submission (i.e., detailed engineering/architectural plans, etc.; see Section 31).
A. Concept Plan (or Preliminary Plat) - This plan shall be submitted by the applicant at the time of the PD request (for exceptions, see Section 24.5(D)). The plan shall show the applicant's intent for the use of the land within the proposed Planned Development district in a graphic manner and, as may be required, supported by written documentation of proposals and standards for development. The City may prepare application form(s) which further describe and explain the following requirements:
1. Residential Preliminary Plat - A preliminary plat shall be submitted with any residential PD zoning request for a development comprised of single-family (detached or attached) or two-family (duplex) dwellings on individually platted lots, and shall show general uses, phasing of the development, access, thoroughfares, alleys (if proposed), preliminary lot arrangements, proposed densities, proposed screening, landscaped or private amenity areas, project scheduling, and other pertinent development data. (See the Subdivision Ordinance for application
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
69
procedures and requirements for a preliminary plat submission.)
2. Nonresidential Concept Plan - A Concept Plan shall be submitted with any nonresidential, multi-family, or manufactured (mobile) home PD zoning request, and shall clearly show all pertinent aspects of the type and nature of the proposed development. The Concept Plan shall show the types of use(s) proposed; access, topography and boundaries of the PD area; existing physical features of the site; existing and proposed streets, alleys, easements and lot lines; location of existing or proposed public facilities; building heights and locations; parking areas and ratios; fire lanes; screening and landscaped areas; project phasing and scheduling; and other pertinent development data to adequately describe the proposed development.
a. A detailed Site Plan shall be submitted for approval (in accordance with Subsection B below, and with Section 31 of this Ordinance) within one (1) year from the approval date of the Concept Plan for all or some portion/lot of the Planned Development covered by the overall Concept Plan. If a detailed Site Plan is not submitted within one (1) year, then the Concept Plan may be subject to review by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners to determine its continued validity. If the City determines that the Concept Plan is no longer valid or that the proposed development is no longer viable, then a new Concept Plan (along with a zoning application to amend the PD ordinance and its accompanying Concept Plan) must be submitted for review and approval prior to detailed Site Plan review/approval (and any subsequent issuance of a building permit) for any portion of the PD district.
B. Site Plan (detailed) - Submission and approval of the detailed Site Plan shall be in accordance with Section 31 of this Ordinance, and shall accompany an application for Planned Development zoning if the applicant prefers to submit the detailed Site Plan in lieu of the required Concept Plan. The detailed Site Plan will establish the final plans for development of the Planned Development district (or any portion/lot thereof), and it shall substantially conform to the site layout and development data approved on the Concept Plan (adopted along with the PD ordinance). If a Concept Plan was previously approved for the overall PD district, then a detailed Site Plan (along with the required engineering/architectural site construction plans) may be submitted for only the sections/lots that are proposed for immediate development rather than for the entire PD. If no Concept Plan was approved with the ordinance establishing the PD, then a detailed Site Plan (along with the required engineering/architectural site construction plans) must be submitted for the entire PD, even though only portions of it are proposed for immediate development.
For any single- or two-family residential district (AG, SF-15, SF-10, SF-6, R-1, R-2 or MF), a Preliminary Plat shall qualify as the detailed Site Plan.
24.5 APPROVAL PROCESS AND PROCEDURE:
A. The procedure for establishing a Planned Development zoning district shall follow the procedures for zoning amendments as set forth in Section 10 of this Ordinance. This procedure shall be expanded to include concurrent consideration and approval (or denial) of the Concept Plan (or Preliminary Plat, for a residential PD) or the detailed Site Plan (or Final Plat, for a residential PD) which is submitted along with the PD zoning
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
70
request application. The public hearings conducted for, and the subsequent actions taken upon, the PD zoning request shall also include the accompanying Concept Plan/Preliminary Plat or detailed Site Plan/Final Plat.
B. The ordinance establishing the Planned Development zoning district shall not be approved (or adopted) until the accompanying Concept Plan or detailed Site Plan is approved by the Board of Commissioners, and until all other procedural requirements set forth in Section 10 are satisfied.
24.6 When a zoning request for a Planned Development district is being considered, a written report from the City Manager (or his/her designee) discussing the projects impact upon planning, engineering, water utilities, electric, sanitation, building inspection, tax, police, fire and traffic, as well as written comments from applicable public agencies (such as the School District and/or utility companies), may be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the Commission making any recommendations to the Board of Commissioners. In the event written comments and advisement are not forthcoming in a reasonable amount of time, the Commission may, at its discretion, make a recommendation to the Board of Commissioners without said comments or advisement.
24.7 All Planned Development zoning districts approved in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance in its original form, or by subsequent amendments thereto, shall be prefixed by a PD designation and assigned a unique identification number (e.g., PD-1, PD-2, PD-3, and so on), and shall also be referenced on the Zoning District Map. A list of such Planned Development districts, showing the uses permitted and any other special stipulations of each PD district, shall be maintained by the City.

SECTION 26 SUP -- SPECIFIC USE PROVISIONS
26.1 SPECIFIC USES:
The purpose of this overlay district is to allow certain uses within base zoning districts that, under most circumstances, would not be compatible with other permitted uses but with certain conditions and development restrictions may be compatible.
The Board of Commissioners by an affirmative vote may, after public hearing and proper notice (in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 10) to all parties affected, and after recommendations from the Planning and Zoning Commission that the uses are in general conformance with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and with general objectives of the City, and containing such requirements and safeguards as are necessary to protect adjoining property, authorize certain uses by a Specific Use Provision (SUP). As a zoning action, issuance of an SUP shall only apply to real property (i.e., shall not be attached to any person, business entity, etc.), shall not be transferred from one property to another (i.e., shall not move if a business operation relocates), and shall not expire without proper zoning action to rescind the SUP (i.e., change the zoning to remove the SUP, with appropriate public notification, public hearing, etc.).
A zoning application for an SUP shall be accompanied by a metes and bounds description and a survey (i.e., drawing) exhibit showing the property for which the SUP is being requested, and by a site plan (see Section 31) drawn to scale and showing the general arrangement of the project, together with essential requirements such as off-street parking facilities; size, height, construction materials, and locations of buildings and the uses to be permitted; location and construction of signs; means of ingress and egress to public streets; the type of visual screening such as walls, plantings and fences; and the relationship of the intended use to all existing properties and land uses in all directions to a minimum distance of two hundred feet (200'). The City shall make available application forms specifying drawing requirements. The City Manager (or his/her designee), Planning and Zoning Commission or Board of Commissioners may require additional information or drawings (such as building floor plans), operating data and expert evaluation or testimony concerning the location, function and characteristics of any building or use proposed. The site plan shall be reviewed and approved along with the SUP zoning application, and in accordance with Section 31 of this Ordinance.
26.2 SPECIFIC USE PROVISION REGULATIONS:
A. In recommending that a Specific Use Provision for the premises under consideration be granted, the City shall determine that such uses are harmonious and adaptable to building structures and uses of abutting property and other property in the vicinity of the premises under consideration, and shall make recommendations as to requirements for the paving of streets, alleys and sidewalks, means of ingress and egress to public streets, provisions for drainage, adequate off-street parking, screening and open space, heights of structures, and compatibility of buildings. In approving a requested SUP, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners may consider any or all of the following:
1. The use is harmonious and compatible with surrounding existing uses or proposed uses;
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
74
2. The activities requested by the applicant are normally associated with the permitted uses in the base district;
3. The nature of the use is reasonable;
4. Any negative impact on the surrounding area has been mitigated; and/or
5. That any additional conditions specified ensure that the intent of the district purposes are being upheld.
B. In granting a Specific Use Provision, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners may impose conditions which shall be complied with by the owner or grantee before a certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Building Official, or his/her designee, for use of the building on such property pursuant to such Specific Use Provision and such conditions precedent to the granting of the certificate of occupancy. Any special conditions shall be set forth in writing by the Board of Commissioners prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy, and shall be incorporated into the amending ordinance establishing the SUP.
C. No Specific Use Provision shall be granted unless the applicant, owner and grantee of the Specific Use Provision shall be willing to accept and agree to be bound by and comply with the written requirements or conditions of the Specific Use Provision, as incorporated into the amending ordinance establishing the SUP, and as reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and approved by the Board of Commissioners.
D. A building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be applied for and secured within one (1) year from the time of granting the Specific Use Provision, provided however, that the Board of Commissioners may authorize an extension of up to one (1) additional year. After the one-year period (and the extension, if such has been granted by the Board of Commissioners) has elapsed, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners may review the site plan for continued validity and compliance. If the site plan is determined to be invalid or no longer viable, then the applicant/property owner(s) must submit a new or revised site plan for approval prior to any construction or to application for a building permit for the area designated for the Specific Use Provision. The new site plan must be resubmitted for review and approval in accordance with Section 31 of this Ordinance. If building construction/use of an SUP has not commenced within a reasonable amount of time after one (1) year, then the Board of Commissioners, at its option, may initiate proceedings to rescind said SUP for lack of use.
E. No building, premise, or land used under a Specific Use Provision may be enlarged, modified, structurally altered, or otherwise significantly changed unless an amended Specific Use Provision is granted for such enlargement, modification, structural alteration, or change.
Minor changes or alterations may be approved by the City Manager, or his/her designee.
F. The Zoning Board of Adjustments (ZBA) shall not have jurisdiction to hear, review, reverse, or modify any decision, determination, or ruling with respect to the specific land use designated by any Specific Use Provision.

ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
75
G. When the Board of Commissioners authorizes granting of a Specific Use Provision, the Zoning District Map shall be amended according to its legend to indicate that the affected area has conditional and limited uses, and said amendment is to indicate the appropriate zoning district for the approved use and prefixed by a "SUP", or "S" designation followed by the identification number assigned to that particular SUP (e.g., S-1, S-2, S-3, and so on). A list of all issued SUPs, showing the uses allowed and any other special stipulations of each SUP, shall be maintained by the City.

D. Classification of New/Unlisted Uses - It is recognized that new types of land use will develop, and forms of land use not presently anticipated may seek to locate in the City of Burkburnett. In order to provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use in the Use Charts (Sections 35.2 through 35.12) shall be made as follows:
1. Initiation:
a. A person, City department, the Planning and Zoning Commission, or the Board of Commissioners may propose zoning amendments to regulate new and previously unlisted uses.
b. A person requesting the addition of a new or unlisted use shall submit to the City Manager, or his/her designee, all information necessary for the classification of the use, including but not limited to:
(1) The nature of the use and whether the use involves dwelling activity, sales, services, or processing;
(2) The type of product sold or produced under the use;
(3) Whether the use has enclosed or open storage and the amount and nature of the storage;
(4) Anticipated employment typically anticipated with the use;
(5) Transportation requirements;
(6) The nature and time of occupancy and operation of the premises;
(7) The off-street parking and loading requirements;
(8) The amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic materials and vibration likely to be generated; and
(9) The requirements for public utilities such as sanitary sewer and water and any special public services that may be required.
2. The City Manager, or his/her designee, shall refer the question concerning any new or unlisted use to the Planning and Zoning Commission requesting a recommendation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. The referral of the use interpretation question shall be accompanied by the statement of facts in subsection "b" above. An amendment to this Ordinance shall be required as prescribed by Section 10.
3. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the nature and described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses permitted in the various districts and determine the zoning district or districts within which such use is most similar and should be permitted.
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
79
4. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall transmit its findings and recommendations to the Board of Commissioners as to the classification proposed for any new or unlisted use. The Board of Commissioners shall approve or disapprove the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission or make such determination concerning the classification of such use as is determined appropriate based upon its findings. If approved, the new or unlisted use shall be amended in the use charts of the Zoning Ordinance according to Section 10 (i.e., following notification and public hearing, etc.).
5. Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted by the City Manager, or his/her designee, as those of a similar use. When a determination of the appropriate zoning district cannot be readily ascertained, the same criteria outlined above ("b") shall be followed for determination of the appropriate district. The decision of the City Manager, or his/her designee, may be appealed according to the process outlined in subsections "2" through "4" above.

SECTION 28 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
28.1 PURPOSE:
To secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to lessen congestion on public streets; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation; to conserve the value of buildings; and to encourage the most appropriate use of land. Minimum off-street parking and loading shall be provided as set forth in the following schedules and provisions.
28.2 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS -- SPECIAL OFF-STREET PARKING PROVISIONS:
A. Required off-street parking shall be provided on the same site as the use it is to serve.
B. In the SF-6, SF-10 and SF-15 residential zoning districts (and in the R-1 and R-2 districts for any single-family, two-family, patio home, townhome, triplex or quadriplex dwelling unit), all required vehicle parking shall be on a suitably paved parking surface. All driveways and approaches to parking spaces shall be similarly paved.
C. In the SF-6, SF-10 and SF-15 residential zoning districts (and in the R-1 and R-2 districts for any single-family, two-family, patio home, townhome, triplex or quadriplex dwelling unit), no permanent storage of heavy load vehicles (see definition for heavy load vehicle) shall be permitted between the front of the primary structure and the front property line.

3. Parallel: Eight feet (8') by twenty-two feet (22')
E. All parking and loading spaces, and vehicle sales areas on private property shall have a vehicle stopping device (e.g., curb, wheel stop, etc.) installed so as to prevent parking of motor vehicles in any required landscaped areas, to prevent vehicles from hitting buildings, to protect public and/or private utility structures/facilities, and to prevent parked vehicles from overhanging a public right-of-way line, public sidewalk, or adjacent private property. An extra-wide sidewalk on private property may be permitted so as to allow encroachment of vehicle overhang while maintaining an unobstructed four-foot (4') minimum sidewalk width. The requirement shall apply only where spaces are adjacent to the walks, right-of-way, and required landscaping. Parking shall not be permitted to encroach upon the public right-of-way in any case. For new construction only, all vehicle maneuvering shall take place on-site. No public right-of-way shall be used for backing or maneuvering into or from a parking space, or for circulation within the parking lot.

J. To ensure that all requirements set forth in this Section are carried forward, it will be the responsibility of the owner of the parking area to adequately maintain the facility. All off-street parking areas shall be kept free of trash, debris, vehicle repair operation or display and advertising uses. At no time after initial approval of the parking area layout can changes be made in the location and number of provided spaces without approval of the City Manager, or his/her designee.

Each site shall provide a designated on-site loading and maneuvering area for trucks (see Illustration 2). Such off-street loading space may be adjacent to (but not any portion of) a public alley or private service drive, or it may consist of a truck berth within the structure.

Screening shall be subject to the following standards:
1. Screening shall be a brick/masonry wall not less than ten feet (10') in height. An alternative form of screening (e.g., a tall, living screen/hedge) may be approved on the site plan, provided that it will achieve the purpose and intent of this subsection (i.e., opacity; ten-foot height; screening loading areas from view of streets) within three years after planting (if a living screen).

1. Based upon analysis by the City, if projected volumes of traffic entering or leaving a development are likely to interfere with the projected peak traffic flow volumes on adjoining streets, additional right-of-way and paving in the form of a deceleration lane or turn lane may be required of a developer in order to reduce such interference.
2. The determination of additional right-of-way or paving requirements shall be made at the time the final site plan is submitted for approval.
C. Vehicular access to non-residential uses shall not be permitted from alleys serving residential areas.

Up to fifty percent (50%) of the parking spaces required for a theater or other place of evening entertainment (after 6:00 p.m.), or for a church, may be provided and used jointly by banks, offices, and similar uses not normally open, used, or operated during evening hours. Shared parking must be on the same parking lot. Reduction due to shared parking shall be determined by the City Manager, or his/her designee. To assure retention of the shared parking spaces, each property owner shall properly draw and execute a document expressing the same and shall file this agreement with the City of Burkburnett.

B. In any case where the required parking spaces are not located on the same lot with the building or use served, or where such spaces are collectively or jointly provided and used, approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners is required according to the following criteria:
1. Off-site parking may be permitted on an immediately contiguous lot or tract, or on a lot or tract within one hundred fifty feet (150') of such building or structure providing:

31.2 APPROVAL PROCESS:
A. The City Manager (or his/her designee) shall review and evaluate all site plan submissions, and shall make a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission to approve the site plan, to approve the site plan with conditions or stipulations, or to deny the site plan for certain reasons. The City Manager, or his/her designee, may prepare a written report/evaluation of the site plan/development application, which may include background information on the subject property, its zoning history, development and zoning patterns surrounding the site, discussion of any issues or concerns, and a staff recommendation as described above. The staff report/evaluation should be made available to members of the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the meeting date on which the application will be considered in order to allow time for review and for site visitation, if necessary.
B. The City Manager, or his/her designee, shall schedule consideration of the site plan on the regular agenda of the Planning and Zoning Commission within thirty (30) days after the submission is received (or, in the case of an incomplete submission, after the submission is deemed complete). The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
115
the site plan and shall forward its recommendation to approve the site plan, to approve the site plan with conditions or stipulations, or to deny the site plan to the Board of Commissioners. The site plan shall then be scheduled for consideration by the Board of Commissioners at their next possible meeting. The Board of Commissioners shall determine final approval or disapproval of all site plans.
C. Effect of site plan approval - If development of a lot with an approved site plan has not commenced (i.e., a building permit has not been applied for or issued) within one (1) year of the date of final Board of Commissioners approval of the site plan, then the site plan shall be deemed to have expired. Resubmission of the site plan (i.e., following expiration as described herein) shall be in accordance with site plan submission and review procedures then in effect and shall be accompanied by all required items/information (including payment of filing fees), and reconsideration of the site plan shall take into account all changes to applicable ordinances which may have occurred since prior approval of the site plan.
31.3 REVISIONS TO THE APPROVED SITE PLAN:
A. Minor revisions/amendment - It is recognized that final architectural and engineering design may necessitate minor changes in the approved site plan. In such cases, the City Manager, or his/her designee, shall have the authority to approve minor modifications to an approved site plan (which shall be submitted as an amended site plan which substantially conforms to the previously approved site plan), provided that such modifications do not materially change traffic circulation, building location(s) on the site, proximity of building(s) to nearby residential areas, the size or height (i.e., enlarge) of building(s), or any other conditions specifically attached as part of the Board of Commissioners approval of the site plan. Submission materials and requirements for approval of an amended site plan shall be as determined by the City Manager, or his/her designee.
B. Major revisions - In the event of revisions that are more extensive in nature (i.e., do not conform to the description for minor amendments above), a revised site plan must be resubmitted, reviewed by the City Manager (or his/her designee), and reconsidered by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Commissioners in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section.

SECTION 32 SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
32.1 A. Measuring Setbacks - All setback measurements shall be made in accordance with Illustrations 6, 8 and 9.
B. Configuration of Lots - Wherever possible, flag lots (i.e., lots with minimal, or panhandle type, frontage) shall be avoided. Similarly, through (i.e., double frontage) lots (particularly within residential zoning districts) shall also be avoided wherever possible. (Also see Subdivision Ordinance for regulations pertaining to the configuration of lots.)
32.2 FRONT YARD:
A. On all corner lots, the front yard setback shall be observed along the frontage of both intersecting streets, unless approved specifically otherwise on a final plat. Where single-family and duplex lots have double frontage, extending from one street to another, or are on a corner, a required front yard shall be provided on both streets unless a side or rear yard building line has been established along one frontage on the plat and the lot is physically separated from the adjacent lot(s) by an alley, street right-of-way, creek/flood plain area, or other similar phenomenon by a distance of fifteen feet (15') or more, in which event only one required front yard need be observed (see Section 32.3). The side and/or rear yards in the case of single-family and duplex uses shall be identified and the front of the structure shall not face the side or rear yard (see Illustration 9).
B. Where the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting streets is divided by two or more zoning districts, the front yard shall comply with the requirements of the most restrictive district for the entire frontage (see Illustration 3). Similarly, the front/side yards of a lot which has more than one street frontage shall conform to the setback lines established by the immediately adjacent lot(s) such that the setbacks along the block face are uniform (i.e., consistent; not staggered). At least one front yard setback shall be provided for every lot/parcel.
C. The front yard shall be measured from the property line to the front face of the building, to the nearest supporting member of a covered porch or terrace, or to any attached accessory building. Eaves and roof extensions or a porch without posts or columns may project into the required front yard for a distance not to exceed four feet (4'), and subsurface structures, platforms or slabs may not project into the front yard to a height greater than thirty inches (30") above the average grade of the yard (see Illustration 4).
D. Minimum lot widths for lots with predominate frontage on the curved radius of a street (e.g., cul-de-sac or "eyebrow" portion of a street) shall be measured as the linear distance of the curved front building line, and shall be shown on the subdivision plat. Lot widths for all lots shall be as set forth in the respective zoning district for each lot.
Zoning Ordinance  Ordinance #589 City of Burkburnett, Texas
ss--c:\wp8.0\myfiles\burkburnett\zoningordin-txt.wpd
118
E. Gasoline service station pump islands that parallel a public street may be located a minimum of eighteen feet (18') to the property line adjacent to a public street. For pump islands that are perpendicular or diagonal to a public street, the setback shall be thirty feet (30') in order to prevent vehicles stacking out into the street while waiting for a pump position. Pump islands may extend beyond the front building line as described above (provided that all other requirements of this Ordinance are met), but shall not be closer than fifteen feet (15') to any property line that is not adjacent to a public street.
F. Where a future right-of-way line has been established for future widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare, upon which a lot abuts, then the front, side, or rear yard shall be measured from the future right-of-way line.
G. The maximum height of fences and other structures within the front yard shall be thirty-six inches (36").
32.3 SIDE YARDS:
A. On a corner lot used for one or two-family dwellings, both street exposures shall be treated as front yards on all lots platted after December 21, 1997 (pursuant to the Subdivision Ordinance, Ordinance #445, as amended), except that one street exposure may be designated as a side yard for the corner lot if an alley, street right-of-way, creek/flood plain area, or other similar phenomenon physically separates the corner lot from the adjacent lot by a distance of fifteen feet (15') or more. In such case, a building line may be designated as a side yard of fifteen feet (15') or more (as determined by the applicable zoning district standards). On lots which were official lots of record prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, the minimum side yard adjacent to a side street shall comply with the minimum required side yard for the respective district.
B. Every part of a required side yard shall be open and unobstructed except for the ordinary projections of window sills, belt courses, cornices, and other architectural features not to exceed twelve inches (12") into the required side yard, and roof eaves projecting not to exceed thirty-six inches (36") into the required side yard. Air conditioning compressors and similar equipment are permitted in the side yard.
C. Where a future right-of-way line has been established for future widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare, upon which a lot abuts, then the front, side, or rear yard shall be measured from the future right-of-way line.
32.4 SPECIAL HEIGHT REGULATIONS:
A. In the districts where the height of buildings is restricted to two (2) to three (3) stories, cooling towers may extend for an additional height not to exceed fifty feet (50') above the average grade line of the building. Water stand pipes and tanks, church steeples, domes and spires, school buildings, and institutional buildings may be erected to exceed the height limit, as specified in the particular zoning district, provided that one (1) additional foot shall be added to the width and depth of front, side, and rear yards for each foot that such structures exceed the district height limit.

32.5 COMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAS AND SUPPORT STRUCTURES/TOWERS:
A. In all residential zoning districts (AG, SF-15, SF-10, SF-6, R-1, R-2 and MF), commercial antennas and antenna support structures are prohibited, except as specified within this Section.
1. A commercial antenna may be attached to a utility structure (e.g., electrical transmission/ distribution tower, elevated water storage tank, etc.) exceeding fifty feet (50') in height, provided that the antenna does not extend more than 10 feet above the height of the utility structure (see 32.5(C) below).
2. A commercial antenna may be placed wholly within any building permitted in the zoning district (see 32.5(C) below). A commercial antenna may be mounted flush to the exterior of a building/structure if it is painted and/or disguised to integrate into the overall architectural design and is not readily visible/identifiable as an antenna from public roadways or neighboring residential properties.
B. In nonresidential zoning districts (C/B and I), commercial antennas and antenna support structures are allowed as follows:
1. Commercial antenna support structures are allowed by right if they do not exceed the maximum building height allowed for the zoning district in which they are located. Structures in excess of the height allowed in the zoning district may be allowed by Specific Use Provision (SUP). In all nonresidential zoning districts, antenna support structures must meet the setback requirements from residential districts.
2. A commercial antenna may be attached to a utility structure (e.g., electrical transmission/ distribution tower, elevated water storage tank, etc.) exceeding 50 feet in height, provided that the antenna does not extend more than 10 feet above the height of the utility structure (see 32.5(C) below).
3. A commercial antenna may be placed wholly within any building permitted in the zoning district (see 32.5(C) below). A commercial antenna may also be mounted flush to the exterior of a building/structure if it is painted and/or disguised to integrate into the overall architectural design and is not readily visible/identifiable as an antenna from public roadways or neighboring residential properties.
C. No commercial antenna support structure shall be closer to any residential district boundary line or residential dwelling than a distance equal to twice the height of the support structure. Such setback/distance shall be measured as the shortest possible distance in a straight line from the structure to the closest point of a residential district boundary line or residential dwelling. Setbacks from residentially zoned property do not apply to antennae attached to utility structures exceeding fifty feet (50') in height, or to antennae placed wholly within or mounted upon a building.
D. No amateur or commercial antenna, antenna support structure, microwave reflector/antenna, or associated foundations or support wires or appurtenances shall be located within any required setback area for the front, side or rear yards (see Illustration 8).

E. Antennae (amateur or commercial) shall not interfere with radio or television reception of adjoining property owners, and shall comply with all regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In no manner shall the use of such equipment infringe upon adjoining property owners.
F. Satellite dishes and other similar antennas shall be permitted on the roof of a building, as long as satellite dishes do not exceed three feet (3') in diameter and antennas do not extend over twelve feet (12') above the roof of the building. Any parabolic or satellite dish antenna over three feet (3') in diameter, but not exceeding twelve feet (12') in diameter, may be mounted on the roof if a letter certifying the roofs/buildings structural stability is written and sealed by a registered architect or engineer and submitted to the City Manager, or his/her designee. Roof-mounted antennae that comply with the above do not require additional yard setbacks or setbacks from residential areas or dwellings.
G. Only one (1) satellite dish shall be permitted per residential lot or primary structure, except that a maximum of two (2) dishes shall be allowed if both units are three feet (3') or less in diameter. Satellite dishes in any residential district shall not exceed twelve feet (12') in diameter, and must be permitted by the City Manager, or his/her designee.
