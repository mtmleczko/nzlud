persons who are bona fide residents of the dwelling unit, and the dwelling unit
must be established as the primary residence.
C.  On-Site Employees.  Up to one person not residing in the residence may
work, volunteer or otherwise assist with the business on-site at the dwelling,.
The owner of the business must reside in the residence. The planning commission
may approve more than one nonresident employee if it finds (1) that the
additional employee will not be employed as a driver of a work vehicle kept at
the residence, and (2) that the employee's presence in the premises will not
otherwise violate the intent of this chapter. Only one nonresident employee or
volunteer, or such additional nonresident employees or volunteers as approved
by the planning commission through approval of a major home occupation, is
allowed to work on-site per residence at any one time, regardless of the number
of home occupation licenses held by persons residing in the residence.
D.  Off-Site Employees.  Any home occupation business licensed under this
chapter may utilize persons to work. volunteers or assist with the business
off-site.  The off-site employee, volunteer or any other person assisting with
the business shall not come to the home for purposes related to the home
occupation business, nor shall they park at the home or on the street near the
home.
E. Accessory Use on the Property.  The business use must be clearly incidental
and secondary to the residential use of the dwelling and may not change the
residential character of the dwelling. No more than twenty five percent (25%)
of the total main or upper floor area, or, in the alternative, no more than
fifty percent (50%) of the total floor area of a basement, may be used to
conduct a home occupation. Interior alterations to accommodate a home
occupation are prohibited if the kitchen, the dining area, all bathrooms, the
living room, or a majority of the bedrooms is eliminated. Signs related to the
home occupation are prohibited unless otherwise provided in this title.
Exterior alterations are prohibited if the alterations change the residential
appearance of the dwelling.  Home occupation businesses shall not involve the
use of any accessory building or yard space for storage, sale, rental or
display of supplies or inventory used in the home occupation.
F. Commodities and Display for Sale.  Commodities may be produced on the
premises in accordance with law. Sale of commodities from shelves or similar
display on the premises is not allowed.

license per dwelling unit is allowed; provided, however, that the cumulative
effect of such businesses shall not violate the provisions and the intent of
this chapter. By way of illustration and not limitation, the conduct of
multiple home occupations may not violate the prohibitions against excessive
traffic, and the limit on the number of nonresident employees and motor
vehicles allowed at a residence. Any or all of the home occupation licenses
issued at a residence are subject to suspension or revocation if the cumulative
effect of the conduct of those businesses violates this chapter.
I. Conformity with Safety Codes.  Home occupation licensees shall comply with
all state and local laws, including fire, building, and similar life safety and

during reasonable business hours to determine compliance with the provisions of
this title.

occupation license. Home occupation business licenses are personal to the
applicant, nontransferable and do not run with the land.
L. Vehicles.  One business vehicle used by the licensee in connection with the
home occupation may be parked at the premises, subject to the restrictions in
this chapter. Other motor vehicles and equipment, and trailers used to
transport the same, which are used in connection with the home occupation may
not be stored or parked on the premises of the licensee or in any street
adjacent to the licensed premises. Under no circumstances may motor vehicles
having a gross vehicle weight rating of more than twelve thousand (12,000)
pounds and which are used in connection with the home occupation be stored or
parked on the premises of a home occupation or any street adjacent to those
premises. By way of illustration and not limitation, this subsection is
intended to prohibit the storage or parking of business fleet vehicles, such as
limousines; service or work vehicles (snowplow/landscape maintenance trucks)
and similar vehicles; delivery vehicles; and contractor's equipment and
trailers used to transport the same. As provided in subsection B of this
section, a nonresident employee may not be allowed to drive any business
vehicle parked at the premises as permitted by this subsection as part of that
employee's regular work assignment.
M.   Trailers.  Notwithstanding anything contrary in this chapter, one trailer
may be used in association with the home occupation.  Trailers allowed in
conjunction with a home occupation business are as follows:
   1. An open or enclosed trailer with a body length of 20 feet or less,
excluding the tongue. 
   2. Materials/equipment shall not be stored outside of the trailer.
   3. The trailer may be placed in the side or rear yard behind a fence or
garaged on private property and not within the front yard of any residential
zone except on established driveways.  A trailer must maintain a minimum
setback of five feet (5’) from the front property line so as to provide
adequate visibility.  If the home is located on a corner lot, the trailer shall
not be stored on the street side of the house unless it is out of the required
front yard setback.  If the topography of the lot prohibits the parking of the
trailer on the side, rear, or front yard, the trailer must be stored off-site.
   4. The trailer must be well maintained and must not present negative impacts
for adjacent neighbors including, but not limited to odors, dust, or parking
location.
   5. All areas utilized for the parking of trailers shall be paved with a hard
surface, e.g., concrete, asphalt, brick or other water impenetrable surface. 
This includes the side, rear, and front yard of the home.  It is prohibited to
park upon areas that have been landscaped or are reserved for future
landscaping.
   6. A site plan shall be included with all business license applications
indicating where the trailer will be stored. 
N. Traffic.  The traffic generated by a home occupation may not exceed that
which would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood, and any need
for parking generated by the conduct of such home occupation shall be met off
the street according to city regulations. All business-related vehicles which
park at the location of the home occupation business, including on-site
employees, customers, clients, or business-related visitor vehicles, must use
off-street parking.  This provision excludes stops made by delivery vehicles. 
The home occupation shall not involve the use of commercial vehicles having a
gross vehicle weight rating of more than twelve thousand (12,000) pounds for
delivery of materials to or from the premises.
O. Approval Authority.  Except as otherwise provided in this title, the
community and economic development department is authorized to approve home
occupation applications in accordance with this title.
P. Neighborhood Disruptions Not Permitted.  The home occupation business may
not interfere or disrupt the peace, quiet, and domestic tranquility of the
neighborhood.  The home occupation business shall not create, be associated
with, or produce noises or vibrations, noxious odors, fumes, glare, dust, heat,
excessive traffic, interferences with radio and television reception or any 
other adverse effects that may be discernible beyond the premises.
Q. Storage of Dangerous Materials.  The storage or use of flammable, explosive,
or other dangerous materials is prohibited.

PREAMBLE
Section 10-6-135.5 of the Utah Code requires the City to provide notice of the
proposed transfers, to hold an “enterprise fund hearing”, and to provide
“enterprise fund accounting data” to the public. Further, section 10-6-135.5 of
the Utah Code requires certain notices to be provided after the City adopts a
budget which includes the transfer of enterprise funds to other City funds.
The City provided notice that included an explanation of the proposed transfer
of enterprise funds to other City funds; the specific enterprise fund
information, as defined in the Utah Code, the date, time, and place of the
enterprise fund hearing, and the purpose of the enterprise fund hearing. A
notice was mailed to users of the various enterprises in  recent billings,
which were mailed more than seven days prior to the enterprise fund hearing. On
May 20, 2020, the notice was posted on the Utah Public Notice Website, and
published on the City’s website. The date, time, place, and purpose of the
enterprise fund hearing was also published on the City’s social media platform
seven days prior to the enterprise fund hearing.
On June 2, 2020, the City held an “enterprise fund hearing” regarding the
proposed transfer of enterprise fund monies to other City funds. At this
hearing, the City explained the proposed transfer of enterprise fund money to
other City funds, provided to the public the enterprise fund accounting data,

be appointed by the Mayor, with the advice and consent of the City Council, to
serve in the recused member's place for the limited purpose of reviewing that

controlled record to another governmental entity if the record is necessary to
the performance of the governmental entity's duties and functions; the record

public benefit that outweighs the individual privacy right that protects the
record. (Ord. 16-17)

Subpoenas and other methods of discovery under state or federal statutes, or
rules of civil, criminal, administrative, or legislative procedure are not

private, protected or controlled under the Act and this chapter shall not be
disclosed until the court or administrative law judge orders disclosure. (Ord.
16-17)
2.65.120: PRIVACY INTEREST IN A CITY RECORD:
   A.   The City recognizes and upholds the personal right of privacy retained
by persons who may be the subject of government records. The City also
recognizes that the Act establishes a presumption that governmental records
will generally be considered open and public with certain exceptions. The City
may, at its discretion, disclose records that are "private" or "protected" as
defined in the Act and this chapter to persons other than those specified in
sections
2.65.050 and
2.65.070 of this chapter, if the City determines that there is no interest in
restricting access to the record, or that the interest favoring access
outweighs the interest favoring restriction of access. Public access is favored
when countervailing interests are of equal weight. The City shall not release
any record when to do so would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of
privacy in accordance with the Act and procedures established in this chapter.
Under circumstances and procedures established by this chapter, certain data in
a record may be rendered nonpublic, although the record itself may be
classified or designated as "public".
   B.   If the City receives a request for access to a record that contains
both information that the requester is entitled to inspect and information the
requester is not entitled to inspect under this chapter and the Act, the City
shall allow access to information in the record that the requester is entitled
to inspect under this chapter and the Act. The City may deny access to
information in the record if the information is not subject to disclosure under
this chapter and the Act.
   C.   The City may require that the requester of the private and controlled
records provide a written release dated not more than ninety (90) days prior to
the date of the request, from the subject of the record in question before
access to such record is provided. (Ord. 16-17)
2.65.130: CLASSIFICATION, DESIGNATION AND RETENTION OF RECORDS:
All City records and records series shall be evaluated, designated, classified
and scheduled for retention consistent with the provisions of the Act and this
chapter. The City may classify a particular record, record series or
information within a record at any time, and is not required to classify a
particular record, record series or information until access to the record is
requested. The City may redesignate or reclassify records at any time. Any
record or record series generated in the future shall also be so designated,
classified and scheduled for retention. Records classification, designation and
scheduling for retention shall be conducted under the supervision of the City
Records Officer. Classification, designation and retention guidelines shall be
prepared and promulgated by the City Records Officer. (Ord. 16-17)
2.65.140: RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR RECORDS:
   A.   Requests, either verbal or written, for a City record shall be made to
the City department maintaining the record in question. The City department may
respond to a verbal request consistent with the provisions of this chapter. The
City department may require the requester to fill out and present a written
request. The written request shall include the name, mailing address, daytime
telephone number, if available, of the requester, and a description of the
records requested that identifies the record with reasonable specificity.
Requesters of nonpublic records shall adequately identify themselves and, if
applicable, their status when requesting access to nonpublic records. The date
and time of the request shall be included on the written request and all time
frames provided under this chapter shall commence from that time and date.
Request for records shall, to the extent possible, be responded to within ten
(10) business days after receipt of the written request or within five (5)
business days after receiving a written request if the requester demonstrates
that an expedited response benefits the public rather than the person. Any
person who requests a record to obtain information for a story or report for
publication or broadcast to the general public is presumed to be acting to
benefit of the public rather than a person. If the City department does not
have custody of the record, it shall request the appropriate City department to
respond.
   B.   In response to a request, the City is not required to:
      1.   Create a record;
      2.   Compile, format, manipulate, package, summarize or tailor
information;
      3.   Provide a record in a particular format, medium, or program not
currently maintained by the governmental entity;
      4.   Fulfill a person's records request if the request unreasonably
duplicates prior records requests from that person; or
      5.   Fill a person's records request if:
         a.   The record requested is accessible in the identical physical form
and content in a public publication or product produced by the City;
         b.   The City provides the person requesting the record with the
public publication or product; and
         c.   The City specifies where the record can be found in the public
publication or product.
   C.   Upon request, the City shall provide a record in a particular format if
the City is able to do so without unreasonably interfering with the City's

costs incurred in providing the record in the requested format.
   D.   The City is not required to fulfill a request if the request
unreasonably duplicates prior records requests from that person.
   E.   The City may allow a person requesting records to copy the records if
the requester requests copies of more than fifty (50) pages of records from the
City; the records are contained in files that do not contain records that are
nonpublic or the records may be segregated to remove the nonpublic information
from disclosure; and the City supervises the copying process to protect the
public from the potential for loss of a public record.
   F.   If the requirements in subsection E of this section are met, the City

provide the requester's own copying facilities and personnel to make the copies
at the City's offices and waive the fees for copying the records.
   G.   The City may provide access to an electronic copy of a record in lieu
of providing access to its paper equivalent.

or reasons for the delay as provided in this section; or
      5.   Such other appropriate response as may be established in the Act or
this chapter.
   I.   1. In most circumstances and excepting those eventualities set out in
subsection I2 of this section, the appropriate City department or the City
Attorney's office shall respond to a written request for a public record within
the time period specified in subsection A of this section.
      2.   The following extraordinary circumstances shall justify the City's
failure to respond to a written request for a record within the specified time
period and shall extend the time for response thereto to that time reasonably
necessary to respond to the request:
         a.   Another governmental entity is currently and actively using the
record requested;
         b.   The record is being used as part of an audit, and returning the
record before the completion of the audit would impair the conduct of the
audit;
         c.   The request is for a record series containing a substantial
number of records; the requester seeks a substantial number of records or
records series; or the requester seeks a substantial number of records or
records series in requests filed within five (5) working days of each other;
         d.   The request requires the City to review a large number of records
to locate the records requested;
         e.   The appropriate City department is currently processing either a
large number of records requests or is subject to extraordinary seasonal
workloads;
         f.   The request involves legal issues that require an analysis by
legal counsel to determine the proper response to the request;
         g.   The request involves extensive editing to separate public
information in a record from that which is nonpublic; or
         h.   Segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect
from information that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires
computer programming.
   J.   If the time limits are extended based on extraordinary circumstances
provided in this chapter and the Act, the response to the request shall be made
within the following time limits:
      1.   For the extraordinary circumstance provided in subsection I2b of
this section, the City shall provide the requester with an estimate of the
amount of time it will take to finish the work required to respond to the
request and complete the work and disclose those records that the requester is
entitled to inspect as soon as reasonably possible.
      2.   For the extraordinary circumstances provided in subsections I2c, I2d
and I2e of this section, the City shall disclose the records that it has
located which the requester is entitled to inspect; provide the requester with
an estimate of the amount of time it will take to finish the work required to
respond to the request; and complete the work and disclose those records that
the requester is entitled to inspect as soon as reasonably possible.
      3.   For the extraordinary circumstance provided in subsection I2f of
this section, the City shall either approve or deny the request within five (5)
business days from the date of the original request.
      4.   For the extraordinary circumstance provided in subsection I2g of
this section, the City shall fulfill the request within fifteen (15) business
days from the date of the original request.
      5.   For the extraordinary circumstance provided in subsection I2h of
this section, the City shall complete its programming and disclose the
requested records as soon as reasonably possible.
      6.   For any requester that does not establish a right to an expedited
response, the City may choose to require the requester to provide for copying
the records or treat a request for multiple records as separate records
requests and respond sequentially to each request.
   K.   If the City fails to provide the requested records or issue a denial
within the specified time period that failure is considered the equivalent of a
determination denying access to the records.
   L.   The City and requester may, by agreement, extend the time periods
specified in this section.
   M.   In response to a request for access, the City may redesignate or
reclassify the record or segregate data in the requested record in accordance
with this chapter and the Act. (Ord. 16-17)

chapter shall be made available to a requester as provided in this chapter and
the Act.

providing magnetic tapes, disks or other means of electronic storage containing
the computer, data processing or other electronic information system records;
or
      3.   By the use, where appropriate, of remote terminals which have access
to City computer, data processing or electronic information systems permitting
such remote terminal access and provided that due regard shall be exercised to
ensure that nonpublic records will not be available by remote terminal access.
   C.   All data retained on computer, data processing or electronic
information systems shall be kept and maintained with due diligence to protect
the security of any record which is considered nonpublic under the Act and this
chapter. (Ord. 16-17)

by the information in the record, and the requester is impecunious.

fee waiver may appeal the denial in the same manner as a person appeals when
inspection of a public record is denied under this chapter.
   E.   If a person requesting a record does not establish a right to an
expedited response, the City may charge a person for the actual cost of any

distribution of the record; or the release of the record was otherwise wilfully

Act, be subject to disciplinary action, including termination. (Ord. 16-17)

chapter and sections
3.10.360,
3.10.370,
3.10.410, and
3.10.420 of this chapter, and section 63G-6a-2105 of the Utah Code, as amended.
   B.   Invitation For Bids: Each competitive sealed bid proceeding shall be
commenced by the Purchasing Agent, or designee, issuing an invitation for bids,
which shall include specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions
applicable to the procurement.
   C.   Public Notice: Public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given
for a period of not less than five (5) business days prior to the date set
forth therein for the opening of bids. Such notice may include publication in
an electronic format, such as the Utah public notice website, a newspaper of
general circulation within the State, or any other means designed to provide
reasonable public notice of the invitation for bids. The public notice shall
state the place, date, and time of bid opening.
   D.   Bid Opening: Bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place
designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid, and such other
relevant information as the purchasing agent, or designee, deems appropriate,
together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded; the record and each
bid shall be open to public inspection in accordance with section
3.10.040, "Public Access To Procurement Information", of this chapter.
   E.   Bid Acceptance And Bid Evaluation:
      1.   Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or
correction, except as authorized in this chapter.
      2.   Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the
invitation for bids, which may include, but are not limited to, criteria to
determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, delivery, and
suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid
price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively
measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle
costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be
used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the
invitation for bids. If the invitation for bids is for a construction project,
the evaluation criteria must include, and require the offeror to show, the
existence and quality of:
         a.   An offeror's company safety plan; and
         b.   The offeror's safety plan for the specific project that is the
subject of the proposal.
   F.   Correction Or Withdrawal Of Bids; Cancellation Of Awards: Correction or
withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or
cancellation of awards or agreements based on such bid mistakes, may be
permitted by the purchasing agent, or designee, where appropriate. Mistakes
discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written,
electronic or facsimile notice received in the office designated in the
invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening,
corrections in bids shall be permitted only to the extent that the bidder can
show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental
character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually
intended. After the bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions
of bids prejudicial to the interest of the City or fair competition shall be
permitted. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake
of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if:
      1.   The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but
the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or
      2.   The bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly
demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit the correction or
withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or agreements based on bid mistakes,
shall be supported by a written determination made by the purchasing agent, or
designee.
   G.   Award: The agreement shall be awarded by written notice to the lowest
responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria
set forth in the invitation for bids. In the event the low responsive and
responsible bid for a construction project exceeds available funds as certified
by the Director of Finance and Administration, and such bid does not exceed
such funds by more than five percent (5%), the purchasing agent, or designee,
is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of
work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the
low responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the
amount of available funds. Any such negotiated adjustment shall be based only
upon eliminating independent deductive items specified in the invitation for
bids.
   H.   Multistep Sealed Bidding: When it is considered impractical to prepare
initially a purchase description to support an award based on price, an
invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers
to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers
have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth
in the first solicitation. (Ord. 19-05: Ord. 17-14)
3.10.090: COMPETITIVE SEALED PROPOSALS:
   A.   Other Methods: When the purchasing agent, or designee, determines in
writing that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or
not advantageous to the City, an agreement may be entered into using methods,
as approved and authorized under this chapter, other than the competitive
sealed proposals method.
   B.   Request For Proposals/Request For Statement Of Qualifications:
Competitive sealed proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposals
("RFP") or a request for a statement of qualifications (RFQ).

modifications received, if any, and a description sufficient to identify the
item offered. The register of proposals shall be open for public inspection
only after award of the agreement.
   E.   Evaluation Factors:
      1.   The RFP or RFQ shall state the relative importance of price and
other evaluation factors, including the quantitative basis for evaluation. No
criteria may be used in an RFP or RFQ response evaluation that are not set
forth in the RFP or RFQ.

         b.   The offeror's safety plan for the specific project that is the
subject of the proposal.
   F.   Mandatory Selection Committee: All RFP or RFQ awards shall be made by a
Selection Committee, which shall evaluate RFP or RFQ responses according to the
evaluation factors required by subsection E of this section. The Selection
Committee shall be comprised of no less than three (3) members. Not less than
one member shall represent the department to which the RFP or RFQ applies, and
not less than one member shall be the purchasing agent, or his/her designee.
For RFPs or RFQs with an anticipated award amount of more than two hundred
fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), not less than one member shall represent
the Finance and Administration Department. No member of any Selection Committee
shall communicate or negotiate with any potential offeror, except in the

provided in the RFP or RFQ, discussions may be conducted with responsible
offerors who submit proposals determined to have a reasonable chance of being
selected to clarify and to assure full understanding of, and conformance to,
the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal
treatment to discuss and revise proposals in writing and such written revisions
may be permitted by the Selection Committee after submissions and prior to
award to obtain best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall
be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by
competing offerors, except for the names of the offerors.
   H.   Award: Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is
determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the City, taking into
consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP or RFQ. No
other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The agreement file
shall contain the basis on which the award is made. (Ord. 19-05: Ord. 17-14)

      5.   Award: Award shall be made to the offeror determined in writing by
the City to be best qualified based on the evaluation factors set forth in the
RFP or RFQ, and negotiation of compensation determined to be fair and
reasonable. If compensation cannot be agreed upon with the best qualified
offeror, then negotiations will be formally terminated with the selected
offeror. If proposals were submitted by one or more other offerors determined
to be qualified, negotiations may be conducted with such other offeror or
offerors, of their respective qualification ranking, and the agreement may be

   H.   Records: Any department making a small purchase shall retain a record
of the names of the businesses contacted, those offering quotations, and the
date and amount of each quotation, and shall document, either on the City's
electronic purchasing system or by paper copy provided to the purchasing agent,
or designee, all quotes received. Such records shall be retained as determined
by the City Recorder, in accordance with the Utah records retention schedule.
   I.   Manipulation Prohibited: Purchases shall not be manipulated to fall
within this section. Without limitation, agreements shall not be artificially
divided, such as by awarding numerous agreements to a single person for
substantially similar performances, or by dividing the work required for a
single project solely for purposes of making use of this section. The
purchasing agent, or designee, may impose requirements in addition to those set
forth in this subsection to provide for equitable and competitive procurement
in an expeditious manner.
   J.   Small Purchase Agreement Modifications And Renewals: Any agreement
solicited under this chapter shall only be modified or renewed as follows:
      1.   Modifications: Agreements shall not be modified in excess of the
maximum dollar amounts stated in this chapter, unless this requirement is
waived in writing by the purchasing agent and the Director of Finance and
Administration.

the same party unless approved in writing by the purchasing agent or designee
and in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 19-05: Ord. 17-14)

with the Act:
         a.   Joint Action: The City must comply when it agrees to exercise
powers jointly with another governmental agency to undertake a joint or

governmental agency, or solely to acquire services if they are not governmental
services, activities or undertakings as described in subsection D1b of this
section.
      2.   Co-Purchases: Agreements where the City joins as a group with other
governmental agencies to purchase supplies, or services that are not
governmental services, activities or undertakings as described in subsection

(Ord. 17-14)
3.10.130: SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT:
   A.   Sole Source Procurement: Without limitation, sole source procurement
may arise when:
      1.   The City needs a supply or service of a unique or specialized
nature, and only one known supplier is reasonably available to meet the need.
      2.   Specific parts, accessories, equipment, materials, services,
proprietary items or other items are necessary to meet the City's needs, and
there are no comparable items reasonably available.
      3.   Items are procured for resale.
   B.   Process: For all sole source procurements:
      1.   A request for a sole source procurement shall be submitted from the
department director, or designee, seeking the sole source procurement to the
Purchasing Agent or designee. The request shall include: a) a description of
the procurement item; b) the total dollar value of the procurement item,
including where applicable, the actual or estimated full life cycle cost of
maintenance and service agreements; c) the duration of the proposed sole source
agreement; d) information documenting that there are no other competing sources
for the procurement item; and e) any other information required by the
Purchasing Agent or designee; and
      2.   The Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall place a written
determination in the procurement file, after conducting a good faith review of
available sources, stating why no other sources are reasonably available, or
why competition would not be likely to produce other acceptable offers. Sole
source procurement shall not be used only to accommodate a desire for a
particular proprietary item unless the City has a need for such specific item,
which can be justified in writing pursuant to the provisions of subsection A of
this section. The Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall negotiate and use
appropriate means to obtain the best price available for the item being
procured.
   C.   Records: A record of sole source procurement shall be maintained as a
public record and shall list each contractor's name, the amount and type of
each procurement agreement, a listing of the item(s) procured under each
procurement, and the identification number of each procurement file. (Ord. 17-
14)
3.10.140: PROCUREMENT TO MEET EXISTING NEEDS:
   A.   Existing Needs: Procurement to meet existing needs may arise when there
is a need to procure matching or compatible supplies and services when other
similar supplies and services would not reasonably meet the City's needs in
connection with existing equipment or facilities.
   B.   Process: To use existing needs procurement, the Purchasing Agent, or
designee, shall place a written determination in the procurement file
specifying the existing items, and explaining the need to match or service
them. The Purchasing Agent, or designee, or department director, or designee,
shall negotiate and use appropriate means to obtain the best price available
for the item being procured. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.150: PROCUREMENT FOR SPECIALIZED SERVICES:
   A.   Specialized Services: Without limitation, the need to procure very
specialized services, or services as a part of confidential matters, may arise
when:
      1.   The City's needs are of a specific and highly specialized nature,
and a general solicitation would not reasonably produce a contractor who can
meet those needs because of the scarcity of service providers, nature of the
expertise needed, conflicts of interest, or other reason; or
      2.   The services relate to confidential matters, and a solicitation
process might disclose or result in adverse consequences with respect to
information that is private or confidential. These matters may arise in
connection with legal issues, security issues, undercover police activities,
and similar matters.
   B.   Process: Except as otherwise provided by the Mayor, to procure on this
basis, the Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall place a written determination
in the procurement file stating the required service, and explaining why a
solicitation process would not be beneficial or would damage confidential
interests. The Purchasing Agent, or designee, or department director, or
designee, shall negotiate and use all appropriate means to obtain the best
price available. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.160: PROCUREMENT FOR EMERGENCIES AND PUBLIC THREATS:
   A.   Generally: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter and
subject to subsections C and D of this section, the Purchasing Agent, or
designee, may make, or authorize others to make, emergency procurement of
supplies, services, or construction items when there exists a threat to public
health, welfare, or safety but where a declaration of local emergency has not
been issued; provided that such emergencies and public threats shall be made
with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. Procurement
made on this basis shall be issued as set forth in this section.
   B.   Definitions: The conditions specified in this section are defined as
follows:
EMERGENCY CONDITIONS: Immediate and serious needs for supplies or services that
cannot adequately be addressed using normal procurement methods. Such needs may
arise by reason of a natural disaster, epidemic, riot, equipment failure or
other reason.
PUBLIC THREATS: Circumstances that appear likely to adversely impact the
public's health, welfare, convenience or safety. They may arise when
circumstances appear to create a risk of environmental contamination, traffic
congestion or hazards, disruption of utility or other public services provided
by the City, or other matters.
   C.   Process: The Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall examine the
circumstances and determine whether they constitute a condition set forth
above. If so, the Purchasing Agent, or designee, may take any action required
by such condition. The Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall place in the
procurement file a written determination and explanation of the condition.
Procurement should be as competitive as possible under the circumstances, but
priority shall be given to meeting the needs of the emergency conditions or
public threat. Only those supplies and services impacted by the conditions in
question may be acquired under this section.
   D.   Declaration Of Emergency By Mayor: The issuance of a declaration by the
Mayor declaring the existence or threatened existence of a local emergency
pursuant to Utah Code section 53-2a-208 and subsection
2.08.010B11 of this Code shall empower the Mayor to make emergency procurement
of supplies, services, or construction items in conjunction with exercising any
and all of the emergency powers permitted by State and local law. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.170: UNFORESEEN CONDITIONS:
   A.   Definition: An "unforeseen condition" creates a need to procure
supplies or services within time frames that could not reasonably be
anticipated or accommodated under normal procurement methods. For example, such
a need may arise when the City must implement a change that is beneficial to
the City in a time frame that will not allow normal procurement methods, and
the benefit of proceeding outweighs the benefit of using processes under this
chapter.
   B.   Process: The Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall require the employee
making such a request to justify in writing why the condition was unforeseen,
and shall make a decision based upon the written justification as to whether
the condition was reasonably unforeseen. After determining that such a
condition exists, the Purchasing Agent, or designee, may take any action
required by such condition, and shall place in the procurement file a written
determination and explanation of the waiver. If the Purchasing Agent, or
designee, determines that the condition was foreseen, or reasonably could have
been foreseen, the procurement shall proceed under the normal provisions of
this chapter. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.180: MARKET COMMODITIES:
The Purchasing Agent, or designee, may exempt commodity purchases from the
requirements of this chapter when the City's internal, written market analysis,
a copy of which shall be maintained in the procurement file, indicates that
such procurements are in the best interests of the City. The Purchasing Agent,
or designee, shall take into account opportunities to take advantage of
seasonal and supply/demand influences when determining whether to exempt
commodity purchases. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.190: CANCELLATION OF INVITATIONS FOR BIDS OR REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS:
An invitation for bids, an RFP, RFQ, or other solicitation may be canceled, or
any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be
specified in the solicitation, when it is for good cause and in the best
interests of the City. The reasons therefor shall be made part of the
procurement file. Each solicitation issued by the City shall state that the
solicitation may be canceled and that any bid or proposal may be rejected in
whole or in part for good cause when in the best interests of the City. Notice
of cancellation shall be sent to all businesses solicited. The notice shall
identify the solicitation, explain the reason for cancellation and, where
appropriate, explain that an opportunity will be given to compete on any
resolicitation or any future procurement of similar items. Reasons for
rejection shall be provided upon request by unsuccessful bidders or offerors.
(Ord. 17-14)
3.10.200: EVALUATION OF BIDS:
   A.   Generally: Bids, proposals, agreements and related matters shall be
evaluated using the criteria in this chapter.
   B.   City's Evaluation Process: When evaluating matters, the City shall
consider the following:
      1.   Solicitation Criteria: The City shall consider the evaluation
criteria stated in a bid or proposal package or other solicitation document.
      2.   Chapter Criteria: As further described in this chapter, the City
shall consider whether a bid, proposal or other offer or submission is
responsive to the City's request, whether the bidder or offeror is the lowest
responsive responsible bidder, and whether any element conflicts with the other
criteria of this chapter.
      3.   Due Diligence: The City may take steps as it deems appropriate to
verify and determine any matter. The City shall determine in its sole
discretion what steps may be appropriate in light of the matters being
considered and the resources of the City. The failure to discover any matter
shall not preclude any subsequent evaluation or action.
      4.   Records: In the manner it shall determine, the Purchasing Agent, or
designee, shall retain in a procurement file records relevant to a solicitation
or award.
      5.   Agreement Management: The City may reevaluate any matter arising
under an agreement which is in conflict with its procurement, or with this
chapter or City procurement rules. Any previous determination made by the City
shall be subject to change by subsequently discovered matters.
   C.   Evaluating Responsiveness: To be responsive, a bid, proposal or other
offer or submission must conform in all material respects to the terms of the
City's solicitation documents. Such terms may include, but are not limited to,
using bid forms, mandatory submittals, required securities, and appropriate
substantive responses. Ministerial errors and other matters in a bid, proposal
or other offer or submission will not necessarily render it nonresponsive, and
the Purchasing Agent shall review such matters and determine whether the
submission is responsive.
   D.   Evaluating Responsibility: To be responsible, a bidder or offeror must
have the capability in all respects to fully perform the agreement
requirements, and have the integrity, capacity and reliability which will
assure good faith performance.
   E.   Determining The Lowest Responsive Responsible Bidder: The City shall
consider the following factors to determine the lowest responsive responsible
bidder:
      1.   To be responsive, a bid, proposal, or other offer or submission must
conform in all material respects to the terms of the City's solicitation
documents. Such terms may include, but are not limited to, using bid forms,
mandatory submittals, required securities, and appropriate substantive
responses. Ministerial errors and other matters in a bid, proposal or other
offer or submission will not necessarily render it nonresponsive, and the
Purchase Agent, or designee, shall review such matters in determining whether
the submission is responsive.
      2.   To be responsible, a bidder or offeror must have the capability in
all respects to fully perform the requirements of the work solicited, and have
the integrity, capacity and reliability which will assure good faith
performance. The City may consider any relevant factors when evaluating
responsibility, including, but not limited to:
         a.   The bidder's or offeror's capacity to perform the requirements,
including whether the bidder or offeror has available appropriate financial,
material, equipment, facility and personnel resources and expertise, or the
ability to obtain them. Without limitation, capacity may also include legal
capacity to enter agreements, the ability to perform within required times, or
the ability to perform any necessary future service and maintenance.
         b.   The bidder's or offeror's ability, skill and quality of
performance.
         c.   The bidder's or offeror's character, integrity, reputation,
judgment, experience and efficiency.
         d.   The bidder's or offeror's ability to work cooperatively with the
City, including, without limitation, whether the bidder or offeror has
previously failed to comply with City agreements or other requirements,
nonpayment of sums due to the City, poor working relationships with or
adversarial actions against the City, suspension, debarment or other
proceedings by the City against the bidder or offeror, or failure to assist the
City in determining responsibility.
   F.   Making A Determination: The submission of any bid, proposal or other
offer or submission constitutes an agreement by the bidder or offeror to
reasonably assist the City with its determination of responsibility.
   G.   Effect Of Determination: The City's determination of responsibility
relates solely to a bidder's overall ability to perform for a specific
procurement, and is not a general assessment of a bidder's capabilities.
   H.   Evaluating Specific Matters: For any bid, proposal, other offer or
submission:
      1.   Joint Ventures: A joint venture may submit a bid, proposal or other
offer or submission if the circumstances of the joint venture are acceptable to
the Purchasing Agent, or designee. The joint venture must obtain this
determination before an agreement may be signed.
      2.   Consultants: Persons who have provided services to the City in
connection with a bid, proposal or other offer or submission, such as by
preparing specifications or designs, performing surveying or testing, or any
other function, may participate in a subsequent solicitation and award except
when a Purchasing Agent, or designee, determines it would not be in the City's
interest. Such a determination and the written basis for decision will be
placed in the procurement file.
      3.   Multiple Or Alternate Bids, Proposals Or Other Submissions: Multiple
or alternate bids, proposals or other offer or submissions will not be
considered or accepted unless they have been solicited. A base bid or proposal,
when clearly indicated, shall be considered as though it was the only bid or
proposal. Multiple or alternate bids may be solicited as provided in the
"Municipal Procurement Handbook".
      4.   No Dependent Bids: Bid, proposal and other offer or submission
materials and prices must stand alone and not be dependent on the submission of
another person.
      5.   Tie Bids: Tie bids occur when identical prices are submitted from
responsive and responsible bidders and that price is the low bid. The
Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall make an award in a manner that is
beneficial to the City, and may make an award in a manner that will discourage
tie bids. Such manners may include:
         a.   Award to the person farthest from the point of delivery.
         b.   Award to the person who previously held the agreement.
         c.   Award to the person with the earliest delivery date.
      6.   Only One Received: If the City receives only one (1) responsive bid,
proposal or other offer or submission, the City may make an award to that
bidder or offeror if the Purchasing Agent, or designee, determines the bid,
proposal or other offer or submission is fair and reasonable and conforms to
all applicable requirements, and that other prospective bidders or offerors had
reasonable opportunity to respond or that there is not adequate time for a
resolicitation. The written determination and basis for decision shall be
placed in the procurement file. The City may also reject the sole bid, proposal
or other offer or submission.
   I.   Inspections And Tests: The City may perform inspections, tests and
other evaluations in any manner conducive to the City's interest, including,
without limitation, the use of third parties. All prospective and actual
recipients of a City agreement shall provide all reasonable assistance and
information required by the City to perform an inspection, test or other
evaluation.
   J.   Modifying Submissions: After the time for submission, a bid, proposal
or other offer or submission may be modified as follows:
      1.   Confirmation Of Bid, Proposal Or Other Matter: When it appears a
mistake has been made, or when the City desires an assurance of any matter, the
City may request a bidder or offeror to confirm the bid, proposal or other
offer or submission in writing.
      2.   Notification Of Error: A bidder or offeror shall notify the
Purchasing Agent, or designee, of any error contained in a bid, proposal or
other offer or submission within two (2) business days after bid opening or the
time for submitting proposals unless the Purchasing Agent, or designee, waives
this requirement. The Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall have sole discretion
to determine whether to permit any modification or withdrawal.
      3.   Modifications By Agreement: The Purchasing Agent, or designee, may
agree with a bidder or offeror to any modifications so long as they do not
prejudice fair competition or the City's interests. Modifications may include
such matters as:
         a.   Time For Accepting: The Purchasing Agent, or designee, and bidder
or offeror may agree that a bid, proposal or other offer or submission will
remain effective for a longer period of time than that stated in the bid,
proposal or other offer or submission.
         b.   Subcontractor Or Supplier Changes: Any proposed change in
subcontractors or suppliers must be submitted to the Purchasing Agent, or
designee, and the Purchasing Agent, or designee, may reject any such proposed
change. The bidder or offeror will receive no additional compensation as a
result of a change to any subcontractors or suppliers, and must continue to
meet the requirements of any contractual and legal requirements.
         c.   Change In Specifications: The Purchasing Agent, or designee, and
bidder or offeror may agree to a change in specifications when such change is
in the City's interest, is reasonably related to the work originally solicited,
and would not be prejudicial to fair competition.
      4.   City's Correction Of Ministerial Mistakes: The Purchasing Agent, or
designee, may at any time correct mistakes in a bid or proposal that are of a
ministerial or minor nature as follows:
         a.   Ministerial Mistakes: Ministerial or minor informalities are
clerical errors and matters of form rather than substance that are evident from
the document, or insignificant mistakes or informalities that can be waived or
corrected without prejudice to other bidders or offerors. They generally do not
have a substantial effect on price. Examples include a failure to:
            (1)   Sign the bid, proposal, or other submissions requiring
signature, but only where they are accompanied by other materials indicating an
intent to be bound.
            (2)   Acknowledge receipt of an addendum, but only if the materials
demonstrate the bidder or offeror received the addendum and intended to be
bound by it, or the addendum has a negligible effect on the bid, proposal or
other offer or submission.
         b.   Mistakes Where Intent Is Evident: If the intent of the bid,
proposal or other offer or submission is clearly evident on the face of the
document, the Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall correct it as intended and
it may not be withdrawn. Examples include:
            (1)   Typographical errors.
            (2)   Errors in extending unit prices.
            (3)   Transposition errors.
            (4)   Arithmetical errors.
            (5)   Differences in written and numerical prices (written shall
control).
         c.   Mistakes Where Intent Not Evident: If the bidder or offeror's
intent is not clearly evident on the face of the document, the bid, proposal or
other offer or submission may not be withdrawn except as agreed by the
Purchasing Agent, or designee.
      5.   Correcting Errors In Judgment: Errors in judgment may not be
corrected, and the bid, proposal or other offer or submission may not be
withdrawn, except as agreed by the Purchasing Agent, or designee. The
Purchasing Agent, or designee, may allow correction of an error in judgment if
it can be done without prejudice to other bidders or offerors. The Purchasing
Agent, or designee, may allow withdrawal if it is in the City's interest.
   K.   Evaluating Cost Or Price: The City may require the submission of any
cost, price or value data, and may evaluate such data in any manner determined
by a Purchasing Agent, or designee. Such evaluation may include an analysis of
life cycle costs, market pricing, rebates or discounts, direct costs, indirect
cost allocations, profit, billing and accounting techniques, price balance
among bid or proposal items, or any other matters relating to cost, price or
value. The City may take any of the following actions in connection therewith:
      1.   Reject Bid Or Proposal: The City may reject any unbalanced bid,
proposal or offer. The City may also reject any bid, proposal or offer where
cost, price or value data is not provided as reasonably requested, or where
such data indicates conditions that are not in the City's interest.
      2.   Audit: At reasonable times and places, the City may audit or cause
to be audited the books and records of any person submitting cost or price data
to determine whether they are reasonable and accurate, and in compliance with
any other requirements. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.210: RESPONSIBILITY OF BIDDERS AND OFFERORS:
   A.   Determination Of Nonresponsibility: If a bidder or offerer who
otherwise would have been awarded an agreement is found nonresponsible, a
written determination of nonresponsibility, setting forth the basis of the
finding, shall be prepared by the Purchasing Agent, or designee. The
unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to supply promptly information in
connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a
determination of nonresponsibility with respect to such bidder or offeror. A
copy of the determination shall be sent promptly to the nonresponsible bidder
or offeror. The final determination shall be made part of the agreement file
and be made public record.
   B.   Right Of Nondisclosure: Prior to award of the bid, information
furnished by a bidder or offeror pursuant to this section shall not be
disclosed by the City, without prior written consent by the bidder or offeror,
unless otherwise required by law. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.220: COST OR PRICING DATA:
   A.   Required Submissions Relating To The Award Of Contracts: A prospective
contractor shall submit cost or pricing data when the agreement is expected to
exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) and is to be awarded by
competitive sealed proposals (section
3.10.090, "Competitive Sealed Proposals", of this chapter), or by sole source
procurement authority (section
3.10.130, "Sole Source Procurement", of this chapter).
   B.   Exceptions: The submission of cost or pricing data relating to the
award of an agreement is not required when:
      1.   The agreement price is based on adequate price competition;
      2.   The agreement price is based on established catalog prices or market
prices;
      3.   The agreement price is set by law or regulation; or
      4.   It is determined in writing by the Purchasing Agent, or designee,
that the requirements of subsection A, "Required Submissions Relating To The
Award Of Contracts", of this section, may be waived, and the determination
states the reasons for such waiver.
   C.   Required Submissions Relating To Change Orders Or Agreement
Modifications: A contractor shall submit cost or pricing data prior to the
pricing of any change order or agreement modification, including adjustments to
agreements awarded by competitive sealed bidding, whether or not cost or
pricing data was required in connection with the initial pricing of the
agreement, when the change or modification involves aggregate increases or
aggregate decreases in costs plus applicable profits that are expected to
exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00).
   D.   Exceptions: The submission of cost or pricing data relating to the
pricing of a change order or agreement modification is not required when:
      1.   Unrelated and separately priced adjustments for which cost or
pricing data would not be required are consolidated for administrative
convenience; or
      2.   It is determined in writing by the Purchasing Agent, or designee,
that the requirements of subsection C, "Required Submissions Relating To Change
Orders Or Agreement Modifications", of this section, may be waived, and the
determination states the reasons for such waiver.
   E.   Certification Required: A contractor, actual or prospective, required
to submit cost or pricing data in accordance with this section, shall certify
that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the cost or pricing data
submitted was accurate, complete, and current as of a mutually specified date
prior to the award of the agreement or the pricing of the change order or
agreement modification.
   F.   Price Adjustment Provision Required: Any agreement award, change order,
or agreement modification under which the submission and certification of cost
or pricing data are required shall contain a provision stating that the price
to the City, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any
significant sums by which the City finds that such price was increased because
the contractor furnished cost or pricing data was inaccurate, incomplete, or
not current as of the date agreed upon between the City and the contractor.
(Ord. 17-14)
3.10.230: COST OR PRICE ANALYSIS:
A cost analysis or a price analysis, as appropriate, shall be conducted prior
to award of the agreement other than one awarded under section
3.10.080, "Competitive Sealed Bids", of this chapter. A written record of such
cost analysis or price analysis shall be made a part of the procurement file.
(Ord. 17-14)
3.10.240: BID AND PERFORMANCE BONDS ON SUPPLY OR SERVICE CONTRACTS:
Bid and performance bonds or other security may be requested for supply
agreements or service agreements as the Purchasing Agent, or designee, deems
advisable to protect the City's interests. Any such bonding or other security
requirements shall be set forth in the solicitation. Bid or performance bonds
shall not be used as a substitute for a determination of a bidder or offeror's
responsibility. (Ord. 17-14)
ARTICLE III.  TYPES OF AGREEMENTS AND AGREEMENT ADMINISTRATION
3.10.250: TYPES OF AGREEMENTS:
   A.   General Authority: Subject to the limitations of this chapter, any type
of agreement which is appropriate to the procurement and which will promote the
best interest of the City may be used, provided that the use of a cost plus a
percentage of cost agreement is prohibited. A cost reimbursement agreement may
be used only when a determination is made in writing that such agreement is
likely to be less costly to the City than any other type or that it is
impracticable to obtain the supply, service, or construction item required
except under such an agreement.
   B.   Multiterm Agreements:
      1.   Specified Period: Unless otherwise provided by law, an agreement for
supplies or services may be entered into for any period of time deemed to be in
the best interests of the City, provided the terms of the agreement and
conditions of renewal or extension, if any, are included in the solicitation
and funds are available for the first fiscal period at the time of contracting.
Payment and performance obligations for succeeding fiscal periods shall be
subject to the annual availability and appropriation of funds therefor.
      2.   Determination Prior To Use: Prior to the utilization of a multiterm
agreement, it shall be determined in writing:
         a.   That estimated requirements cover the period of the agreement and
are reasonably firm and continuing; and
         b.   That such an agreement will serve the best interests of the City
by encouraging effective competition or otherwise promoting economies in City
procurement.
      3.   Cancellation Due To Unavailability Of Funds In Succeeding Fiscal
Periods: When funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support
continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the agreement shall
be canceled and the contractor shall be reimbursed for the reasonable value of
any nonrecurring costs incurred but not amortized in the price of the supplies
or services delivered under the agreement. The cost of cancellation may be paid
from any appropriations available for such purposes.
   C.   Multiple Source Contracting:
      1.   General: A multiple source award is an award of an indefinite
quantity agreement for one (1) or more similar supplies or services to more
than one (1) bidder or offeror. The obligation to order the City's actual
requirements is limited by the provision of Uniform Commercial Code section 2-
306(1).
      2.   Limitations On Use: A multiple source award may be made when award
to two (2) or more bidders or offerors for similar products is necessary for
adequate delivery, service, or product compatibility. Any multiple source award
shall be made in accordance with the provisions of sections
3.10.080, "Competitive Sealed Bids", 3.10.090, "Competitive Sealed Proposals",
3.10.110, "Small Purchases", and 3.10.160, "Procurement For Emergencies And
Public Threats", of this chapter, as applicable. Multiple source awards shall
not be made when a single award will meet the City's needs without sacrifice of
economy or service. Awards shall not be made for the purpose of dividing the
business, making available product or supplier selection to allow for user
preference unrelated to utility or economy, or avoiding the resolution of tie
bids. Any such awards shall be limited to the least number of suppliers
necessary to meet the valid requirements.
      3.   Agreement And Solicitation Provisions: All eligible users of the
agreement, shall provide that:
         a.   The City shall reserve the right to take bids separately if a
particular quantity requirement arises which exceeds its normal requirement or
an amount specified in the agreement; and
         b.   The City shall reserve the right to take bids separately if the
Purchasing Agent, or designee, approves a finding that the supply or service
available under the agreement will not meet a nonrecurring special need of the
City.
      4.   Intent To Use: If a multiple source award is anticipated prior to
issuing a solicitation, the City shall reserve the right to make such an award
and the criteria for award shall be stated in the solicitation.
      5.   Determination Required: The Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall
make a written determination setting forth the reasons for a multiple source
award, which shall be made a part of the procurement file. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.260: AGREEMENT CLAUSES AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Agreement Clauses: All City agreements for supplies, services, and
construction shall include provisions necessary to define the responsibilities
and rights of the parties to the agreement. The Purchasing Agent, or designee,
after consultation with the City Attorney, may issue clauses appropriate for
supply, service, or construction agreements, addressing among others the
following subjects:
      1.   The unilateral right of the City to order in writing changes in the
work within the scope of the agreement;
      2.   The unilateral right of the City to order in writing temporary
stopping of the work or delaying performance that does not alter the scope of
the agreement;
      3.   Variations occurring between estimated quantities of work in
agreement and actual quantities;
      4.   Defective pricing;
      5.   Liquidated damages;
      6.   Specified excuses for delay or nonperformance;
      7.   Termination of the agreement for default;
      8.   Termination of the agreement in whole or in part for the convenience
of the City;
      9.   Suspension of work on a construction project ordered by the City;
and
      10.   Site conditions differing from those indicated in the agreement, or
ordinarily encountered, except that a differing site conditions clause need not
be included in an agreement:
         a.   When the agreement is negotiated;
         b.   When the contractor provides the site or design; or
         c.   When the parties have otherwise agreed with respect to the risk
of differing site conditions.
   B.   Price Adjustments:
      1.   Adjustments in price resulting from the use of agreement clauses
required by subsection A of this section shall be computed in one (1) or more
of the following ways:
         a.   By agreement on a fixed price adjustment before commencement of
the pertinent performance or as soon thereafter as practicable;
         b.   By unit prices specified in the agreement or subsequently agreed
upon;
         c.   By the costs attributable to the events or situations under such
clauses with adjustment of profit or fee, all as specified in the agreement or
subsequently agreed upon;
         d.   In such other manner as the contracting parties may mutually
agree; or
         e.   In the absence of an agreement by the parties, by a unilateral
determination by the City of the costs attributable to the events or situations
under such clauses with adjustment of profit or fee as computed by the City, as
accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
subject to the appeal and remedy provisions of this chapter.
   C.   Contractor's Submissions: A contractor shall be required to submit cost
or pricing data if any adjustment in agreement price is subject to the
provisions of section
3.10.220, "Cost Or Pricing Data", of this chapter.
   D.   Standard Clauses And Their Modification: The Purchasing Agent, or
designee, after consultation with the City Attorney, may establish standard
agreement clauses for use in City agreements. If the Purchasing Agent, or
designee, establishes any standard clauses addressing the subjects set forth in
subsection A of this section, such clauses may be varied provided that any
variations are supported by a written determination that states the
circumstances justifying such variations, and provided that notice of any such
material variation is stated in the invitation for bids, RFP or RFQ. (Ord. 17-
14)
3.10.270: AGREEMENT ADMINISTRATION:
An agreement administration system designed to ensure that a contractor is
performing in accordance with the solicitation under which the agreement was
awarded, and the terms and conditions of the agreement, shall be maintained.
(Ord. 17-14)
3.10.280: APPROVAL OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM:
Except with respect to firm fixed price agreements, no agreement type shall be
used unless it has been determined in writing by the Purchasing Agent, or
designee, that:
   A.   The proposed contractor's accounting system will permit timely
development of all necessary cost data in the form required by the specific
agreement type contemplated; and
   B.   The proposed contractor's accounting system is adequate to allocate
costs in accordance with generally accepted cost accounting principles. (Ord.
17-14)
3.10.290: RIGHT TO INSPECT FACILITIES:
The City may, at reasonable times, inspect the part of the facility, place of
business, or work site of a contractor or subcontractor at any tier which is
pertinent to the performance of any agreement awarded or to be awarded by the
City. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.300: RIGHT TO AUDIT RECORDS:
   A.   Audit Of Cost Or Pricing Data: The City may at reasonable times and
places, audit the books and records of any contractor who has submitted cost or
pricing data pursuant to section
3.10.220, "Cost Or Pricing Data", of this chapter, to the extent that such
books, documents, papers, and records are pertinent to such cost or pricing
data. Any person who receives an agreement, change order, or agreement
modification for which cost or pricing data is required, shall maintain such
books, documents, papers, and records that are pertinent to such cost or
pricing data for three (3) years from the date of final payment under the
agreement.
   B.   Agreement Audit: The City shall be entitled to audit the books and
records of a contractor or a subcontractor at any tier under any negotiated
agreement or subcontract other than a firm fixed price agreement to the extent
that such books, documents, papers, and records are pertinent to the
performance of such agreement or subcontract. Such books and records shall be
maintained by the contractor for a period of three (3) years from the date of
final payment under the agreement and by the subcontractor for a period of
three (3) years from the date of final payment under the subcontract. (Ord. 17-
14)
3.10.310: REPORTING OF ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES:
When for any reason collusion or other anticompetitive practices are suspected
among any bidders or offerors, a notice of the relevant facts shall be
transmitted to the City Attorney's Office. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.320: CITY PROCUREMENT RECORDS:
   A.   Procurement File: All determinations and other written records
pertaining to the solicitation, award, or performance of an agreement shall be
maintained for the City by the Purchasing Agent, or designee and the City
Recorder in a procurement file.
   B.   Retention Of Procurement Records: All procurement records shall be
retained and disposed of by the City in accordance with records retention
guidelines and schedules approved by the City Recorder. (Ord. 17-14)
   ARTICLE IV.  SPECIFICATIONS
3.10.330: SPECIFICATIONS/MAXIMUM PRACTICABLE COMPETITION:
All specifications shall be drafted so as to promote overall economy for the
purposes intended and encourage competition in satisfying the City's needs, and
shall not be unduly restrictive. The policy expressed in this section applies
to all specifications including, but not limited to, those prepared for the
City by architects, engineers, designers, and draftsmen. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.340: BRAND NAME OR EQUAL SPECIFICATION:
   A.   Use: Brand name or equal specifications may be used when the Purchasing
Agent, or designee, determines in writing that:
      1.   No other design or performance specification or qualified products
list is available;
      2.   Time does not permit the preparation of another form of purchase
description, not including a brand name specification;
      3.   The nature of the product or the nature of the City's requirements
makes use of a brand name or equal specification suitable for the procurement;
or
      4.   Use of a brand name or equal specification is in the City's best
interests.
   B.   Designation Of Several Brand Names: Brand name or equal specifications
shall seek to designate three (3), or as many different brands as are
practicable, as "or equal" references and shall further state that
substantially equivalent products to those designated will be considered for
award.
   C.   Required Characteristics: Unless the Purchasing Agent, or designee,
determines in writing that the essential characteristics of the brand names
included in the specifications are commonly known in the industry or trade,
brand name or equal specifications shall include a description of the
particular design, functional, or performance characteristics which are
required.
   D.   Nonrestrictive Use Of Brand Name Or Equal Specifications: Where a brand
name or equal specification is used in a solicitation, the solicitation shall
contain explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the purpose of
describing the standard of quality, performance, and characteristics desired
and is not intended to limit or restrict competition. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.350: BRAND NAME SPECIFICATION:
   A.   Use: Since use of a brand name specification is restrictive of product
competition, it may be used only when the Purchasing Agent, or designee, makes
a written determination that only the identified brand name item or items will
satisfy the City's needs.
   B.   Competition: The Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall seek to identify
sources from which the designated brand name item or items can be obtained and
shall solicit such sources to achieve whatever degree of price competition is
practicable. If only one (1) source can supply the requirement, the procurement
shall be made under section
3.10.130, "Sole Source Procurement", of this chapter. (Ord. 17-14)
ARTICLE V.  PROCUREMENT OF CONSTRUCTION, CONTRACT MANAGEMENT, ARCHITECTURAL AND
ENGINEERING SERVICES
PART A. MANAGEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING
3.10.360: RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTION OF CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING MANAGEMENT
METHODS:
   A.   Purchasing Agent's Discretion: Subject to the limitations in this
section, the Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall have discretion to select the
appropriate method of construction contracting management for a particular
project. In determining which method to use, the Purchasing Agent, or designee,
shall consider the City's requirements, its resources, and the potential
contractor's capabilities. The Purchasing Agent, or designee, shall cause to be
executed, and included in the procurement file, a written statement setting
forth the facts which led to the selection of a particular method of
construction contracting management for each project.
   B.   Factors: Before selecting the construction contracting method to use, a
careful assessment must be made by the Purchasing Agent or designee. The
assessment may consider the following factors:
      1.   When the project must be ready to be occupied;
      2.   The type of project, for example, housing, offices, labs, heavy or
specialized construction;
      3.   The extent to which the requirements of the City and the way in
which they are to be met are known;
      4.   The location of the project;
      5.   The size, scope, complexity and economics of the project;
      6.   The amount of financing available for the project, including whether
the budget is fixed or what the source of funding is;
      7.   The availability, qualifications, and experience of the City's
personnel to be assigned to the project and how much time the City's personnel
can devote to the project;
      8.   The availability, qualifications and experience of outside
consultants and contractors to complete the project under the various methods
being considered;
      9.   The results achieved on similar projects in the past and the methods
used; and
      10.   The comparative advantages and disadvantages of the construction
contracting method and how they might be adapted or combined to fulfill the
needs of the City.
   C.   Approved Methods Of Construction Management: The following is a list
and description of the more common construction contracting management methods
which may be used by the City. The methods listed are not all mutually
exclusive, and may be combined on a project. This list is not intended to be
fixed in respect to all construction projects. In each project, this list may
be adapted to fit the circumstances of that project.
      1.   Single Prime (General) Contractor: The single prime contractor
method is typified by one (1) business, acting as a general contractor,
contracting with the procurement unit to timely complete an entire construction
project in accordance with drawings and specifications provided by the
procurement unit. Generally the drawings and specifications are prepared by an
architectural or engineering firm under contract with the City. Further, while
the general contractor may take responsibility for successful completion of the
project, much of the work may be performed by specialty contractors with whom
the prime contractor has entered into subcontracts.
      2.   Multiple Price Contractors: Under the multiple prime contractor
method, the City contracts directly with a number of general contractors or
specialty contractors to complete portions of the project in accordance with
the City's drawings and specifications. The City may have primary
responsibility for successful completion of the entire project, or the
contracts may provide that one (1) or more of the multiple prime contractors
has this responsibility.
      3.   Design-Build: In a design-build project, an entity, often a team of
a general contractor and a designer, contract directly with the City to meet
the City's requirements as described in a set of performance specifications
and/or a program. Design responsibility and construction responsibility both
rest with the design-build contractor. This method can include instances where
the design-build contractor supplies the site as part of the package.
      4.   Construction Manager Not At Risk: A construction manager is a person
experienced in construction that has the ability to evaluate and to implement
drawings and specifications as they affect time, cost, and quality of
construction and the ability to coordinate the construction of the project,
including the administration of change orders as well as other responsibilities
as described in the contract.
      5.   Construction Manager/General Contractor (Construction Manager At
Risk): The procurement unit may contract with the construction manager early in
a project to assist in the development of a cost effective design. In a
Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC) method, the CM/GC becomes the
general contractor and is at risk for all the responsibilities of a general
contractor for the project, including meeting the specifications, complying
with applicable laws, rules and regulations, that the project will be completed
on time and will not exceed a specified maximum price. (Ord. 17-14)
3.10.370: COST ESTIMATE FOR BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS AND PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS:

long term care, a medicare supplement, a specific disease, vision, or a short-
term limited duration where it is offered and marketed as a supplement health
insurance.

to the public health, the City or its designees may without warning or hearing
issue a written emergency notice of violation to the permit holder or operator,
citing such conditions and specifying the corrective action required to be
taken. An order or emergency notice of violation issued under this subsection
may immediately suspend an establishment's license and state that all
operations shall immediately cease pending a hearing before the hearing officer
as provided in title 5, chapter 5.04 of this Code. Any person to whom such an
order or emergency notice of violation is issued must immediately comply
therewith, or the permit shall be permanently revoked. Any animals at such a
facility may be confiscated by the City or its designee, impounded and provided
for according to the provisions of this chapter.
   E.   Notice: Any notice required or permitted to be given under this section
shall be deemed to have been properly served when the original of the
inspection report form, notice of violation or other notice has been delivered
personally to the permit holder or person in apparent charge of the facility,
or such notice has been sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to

CHAPTER 8.17
HIGHWAY NOISE ABATEMENT MEASURES
SECTION:
8.17.010: Findings
8.17.020: Purpose Of Provisions
8.17.030: Development Of Property Adjacent To State Highways
8.17.040: Responsibility Of Owner Or Developer
8.17.010: FINDINGS:
   A.   The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) regulation entitled
"Procedures for Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and Construction Noise" (23
CFR 772) provides procedures for noise studies and noise abatement measures to
help protect the public health and welfare, supplies noise abatement criteria
and establishes requirements for information to be given to local officials for
use in the planning and design of Federal aid highways. The Utah Department of
Transportation (UDOT) policy entitled "Noise Abatement" (Policy #08-111),
adopted pursuant to 23 CFR 772, addresses highway noise impacts and sets forth
conditions under which noise abatement projects may be approved and constructed
in the State of Utah with the use of Federal aid highway participation funds.
   B.   In order for UDOT to obtain participation funds from FHWA for proposed
Federal aid highway projects for noise abatement measures on existing highways
(known as Type II projects), local authorities are required to take measures
"...to exercise land use control over the remaining undeveloped lands adjacent
to highways in the local jurisdiction to prevent further development of
incompatible activities". 23 CFR 772.13(b).
   C.   In an effort to prevent future traffic noise impacts on currently
undeveloped lands, section 23 CFR 772.15 requires that highway agencies shall
inform local officials within whose jurisdiction the highway project is located
of the following:
      1.   The best estimation of future noise levels (for various distances
from the highway improvement) for both developed and undeveloped lands or
properties in the immediate vicinity of the project;
      2.   Information that may be useful to local communities to protect
future land development from becoming incompatible with anticipated highway
noise levels; and
      3.   Eligibility for Federal aid participation for Type II projects as
described in section 23 CFR 772.13(b).
   D.   In order for the City's residents to benefit from the development and
implementation of Type II projects for noise abatement along eligible highways
within its boundaries, it is found to be in the City's best interests to comply
with Federal regulation and State policy by adopting this chapter. (Ord. 17-25)
8.17.020: PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS:
This chapter is enacted for the purpose of promoting the health, safety and
general welfare of the citizens of the City by minimizing the potential adverse
effects of highway traffic noise and by complying with State and Federal
requirements for highway traffic noise abatement projects. (Ord. 17-25)
8.17.030: DEVELOPMENT OF PROPERTY ADJACENT TO STATE HIGHWAYS:
Consistent with the requirements of 23 CFR 772 and UDOT's Noise Abatement
Policy 08-111, and any revisions thereto, which are adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this chapter, no remaining undeveloped lands located
in the City adjacent to State highways may be developed for any use or activity
which is incompatible with highway traffic noise levels, unless the development
of such lands shall include appropriate noise abatement measures determined
necessary and appropriate by the City and UDOT. A use or activity shall be
deemed incompatible with traffic noise levels when a "traffic noise impact"
occurs, as determined under the following formula:

sidewalk in the City unless the improvement is constructed to lines and grades
which have been approved by the City Engineer. (Ord. 17-30)
12.12.030: PERMIT REQUIRED; COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS OF ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT:
It is unlawful for any person, either as owner, agent, contractor or employee,
to construct curb, gutter or sidewalk in the City without first having obtained
from the City Engineer a permit to do so. The acceptance of such permit by any
person shall be deemed as agreement upon the part of such person to construct
such sidewalk in accordance with the specifications established by the City
Engineer. It is unlawful to construct any such improvement in violation of the
City Engineer's specifications. (Ord. 17-30)
12.12.040: PERMIT FEE:
Curb, gutter and sidewalk construction requires a permit and shall be inspected
for compliance with applicable specifications. The permit fee for construction
of curb, gutter or sidewalk shall be in an amount as determined by the Mayor in
a written policy, to cover the actual costs of the City. (Ord. 17-30)
12.12.050: INSTALLATION OF STREET IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:
   A.   An owner of property who constructs upon or otherwise improves that
property to the extent of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more in value,
as computed by the building official when issuing the applicable building
permits, shall also improve the adjacent public right-of-way. The improvements
required by this section include the installation of curb, gutter, sidewalk and

also include the replacement of existing pavement, curb, gutter or sidewalk if
any of these improvements have deteriorated to a degree that replacement or
repair is required, as determined by the City Engineer.

approval and permanent certificate of occupancy, shall be conditioned upon the
owner's compliance with this section.
   C.   The Mayor may approve a written deferral of installation of
improvements required by this section upon the recommendation of the City
Public Works Director, and under such terms and conditions as will assure
future installation of required improvements. (Ord. 18-06: Ord. 17-30)

responsible for replacement or repair of curb, gutter or sidewalk abutting the
owner's property which has deteriorated to a degree which the City Engineer
determines requires repair or replacement. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to limit the liability of any person causing damage to curb, gutter
or sidewalk located in a public right-of-way. A person who damages any curb,
gutter or sidewalk, negligently or otherwise, is liable for the cost of
replacement.
   B.   If the Mayor, upon the advice of the Public Works Director, finds that
existing curb and gutter, drive approach or sidewalk fronting on parcels which
have a single-family dwelling or a duplex use require replacement, and that
inclusion of the repair in a special improvement district is not practical, the
City Public Works Department may cause the repair work to be done, subject to
the following conditions:

personnel and related support resources to accomplish the repair work; and
      2.   Sufficient budgeted funds are available to pay for the repair work.
   C.   Proposed repair requests under this section will generally be given
priority according to the prioritized list maintained by the City Engineer. The
Public Works Director may assign a different order of priority to requests to
maximize efficient utilization of resources or to coordinate repair work with
other public works projects.
   D.   If the owner of a parcel of property wants to remove curb and gutter,
drive approach, or sidewalk that is not on the prioritized list or does not
want to wait for the project to be done by the City, then the City will remove
the curb and gutter, drive approach, or sidewalk. (Ord. 18-06: Ord. 17-30)
12.12.070: PAYMENT ASSISTANCE FOR PROPERTY OWNERS:
   A.   A single-family dwelling property owner's share of the cost of curb,
gutter or sidewalk repair or replacement which is accomplished pursuant to this
chapter may be abated as provided in title 3 of this Code, as though the
affected property were located in a special improvement district which provided
for installation of curb, gutter or sidewalk; except that all payments due
which are not abated may not be deferred by installment payments.
   B.   Payment in full of all amounts due, or an approved abatement, is due
within sixty (60) days after the date of billing from the City. (Ord. 17-30)

12.14.010: DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND INTENT; SCOPE OF CHAPTER:
   A.   Findings Regarding Rights-Of-Way: The City of Murray finds that the
rights-of-way within the City:
      1.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in
the business and social life of the City;
      2.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
      3.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other
public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for
profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic well-
being of the City and its citizens;
      4.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights-of-way.
   B.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The City finds that while
telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce,
their operations also involve rights-of-way, Municipal franchising, and vital
business and community service, which are of local concern.
   C.   Finding Regarding Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The City
finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote
the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscriminatory
basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability
for Municipal, educational and community services.
   D.   Findings Regarding Franchise Standards: The City finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
      1.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use the rights-of-way to serve the public;
      2.   Fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm that
may flow from such commercial use of rights-of-way;
      3.   Protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority of
the City, in a manner consistent with Federal and State law;
      4.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use
of the City infrastructure;
      5.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights-of-
way;
      6.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunications services, within
the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "Act") (PL 96-104).
   E.   Power To Manage Rights-Of-Way: The City adopts the telecommunications
ordinance codified in this chapter pursuant to its power to manage the rights-
of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah Constitution and statutory authority,
and receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of rights-of-way by
providers as expressly set forth by section 253 of the Act.
   F.   Scope Of Chapter: This chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for
providers of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of
the rights-of-way, including providers of both the system and service, those
providers of the system only, and those providers who do not build the system
but who only provide services. This chapter shall apply to all future providers
and to all providers in the City prior to the effective date of this chapter,
whether operating with or without a franchise as set forth in subsection
12.14.120B of this chapter.

      1.   Cable TV: This chapter shall not apply to cable television operators
or systems.
      2.   Wireless Services: This chapter shall not apply to personal wireless
service facilities.
      3.   Provisions Applicable To Excluded Providers: Providers excused by
other law that prohibits the City from requiring a franchise shall not be
required to obtain a franchise, but all of the requirements imposed by this
chapter through the exercise of the City's police power and not preempted by
other law shall be applicable. (Ord. 17-16)

or a controlling interest shall arise from the beneficial ownership, directly
or indirectly, by any person, or group of persons acting in concert, of more

(Ord. 17-16)
12.14.030: FRANCHISE REQUIRED:
   A.   Nonexclusive Franchise: The City is empowered and authorized to issue
nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction and
maintenance of any telecommunication systems within the City's rights-of-way,
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Franchises may include,
without limitation, franchises for traditional telecommunications services,
small cell technology, landline backhaul transport telecommunications systems,
open video systems, and any subsequently developed telecommunications
technology. The franchise is granted through a franchise agreement entered into
between the City and provider.
   B.   Every Provider Must Obtain: Except to the extent preempted by Federal
or State law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction,
including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to
constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications
services installed and located within the rights-of-way, and every provider
must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or providing
open video services via an open video system. Any open video system or service
shall be subject to the customer service and consumer protection provisions
applicable to the cable TV companies to the extent the City is not preempted as
ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any
appeals. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for
multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other
purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a
cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide
telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a
telecommunications franchise.
   C.   Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights-of-way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-
way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period
stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned or
subleased, except as provided in a franchise agreement. A franchise does not
excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment
agreements before collocating its system on the property of others, including
the City's property. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider
from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a
franchise.
   D.   Current Providers: Except to the extent exempted by Federal or State
law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date of this
chapter shall request issuance of a franchise from the City within ninety (90)
days of the effective date of this chapter. If such request is made, the
provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a
timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not
granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of subsection
12.14.090D of this chapter.
   E.   Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the City under the
provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system
on, over and under the rights-of- way in order to provide services.
   F.   Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate Federal, State and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the City upon the written request of the City
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   G.   Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of
less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner.
   H.   Excavation Permits: Each provider shall be required to pay any
applicable fees required for an excavation permit as provided in chapter 12.16
of this title. (Ord. 17-16)
12.14.040: TAXES AND COSTS:
   A.   Future Costs: Any costs associated with any work to be done by the
Power and Public Works Department to provide space on City owned poles shall be
borne by the provider.
   B.   Taxes And Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the City on the use of the City
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
chapter.
   C.   Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the City on or before the applicable date, interest
thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the rate charged for
delinquent State taxes.
   D.   No Accord And Satisfaction: No acceptance by the City of any funds
shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct
amount, nor shall such acceptance of such payment be construed as a release of
any claim the City may have for additional sums payable.
   E.   Not In Lieu Of Other Taxes Or Fees: The franchise tax is not a payment
in lieu of any other tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically
provided in this chapter, or as required by applicable law. By way of example,
and not limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on City
owned poles are not waived and remain applicable.
   F.   Access/Pole Attachment Agreements; Costs: Notwithstanding any
provisions contained elsewhere in this chapter, providers are still responsible
for obtaining their own access or pole attachment agreements with the City or
other property owners, including paying any applicable costs associated
therewith, prior to collocating its system on the property of another.
   G.   Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event a provider continues
to operate all or any part of the system after the term of the franchise, such
operator shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter and the franchise, provided that any such continued operation shall in
no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a
limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such
continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and
restitution.
   H.   Costs Of Publication: A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law.

         a.   For all support structures constructed or installed within the
City rights-of-way by provider, an annual fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
per support structure;

City on January 1 of each year. Any payment not made within thirty (30) days of
the due date shall bear interest at the rate then charged for delinquent State
taxes, from the due date until paid.
      3.   To the extent that the franchise fee calculation is based on the
existence of facilities constructed or installed by provider within City
rights-of-way, if provider removes a facility from a City right-of-way, the
franchise fee calculation shall not be based on the removed facility as of the
date of removal. Fees for any partial year shall be pro-rated. (Ord. 17-16)

filed pursuant to this chapter, the City may, but shall not be limited to,
request the following from the provider:
      1.   A copy of the order from the PSC granting a certificate of
convenience and necessity, if any is necessary for provider to offer services
within the State of Utah;
      2.   Provider's agreement to comply with the requirements of section

the award of any franchise on the basis of these and other considerations
relevant to the use of the rights-of-way, without competitive bidding. (Ord.
17-16)
12.14.060: CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   General Requirement: No provider shall receive a franchise unless it
agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this section governing
construction and technical requirements for its system, in addition to any
other reasonable requirements or procedures specified by the City or the
franchise, including requirements regarding locating and sharing in the cost of
locating portions of the system with other systems or with City utilities. A

ordinance, before commencing any work in the rights-of-way.
   B.   Quality: All work involved in the construction, maintenance, repair,
upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a safe, thorough and
reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time,
it is determined by the FCC or any other agency granted authority by Federal
law or the FCC to make such determination, that any part of the system,
including, without limitation, any means used to distribute signals over or
within the system, is harmful to the public health, safety or welfare, or
quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, promptly correct all such conditions.
   C.   Licenses And Permits: A provider shall have the sole responsibility for
diligently obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or
other forms of approval or authorization necessary to construct, maintain,
upgrade or repair the system, including, but not limited to, any necessary
approvals from persons and/or the City to use private property, easements,
poles and conduits. A provider shall obtain any required permit, license,
approval or authorization, including, but not limited to, excavation permits,
pole attachment agreements, etc., prior to the commencement of the activity for
which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required.
   D.   Relocation Of The System:
      1.   New Grades Or Lines: If the grades or lines of any rights-of- way
are changed at any time in a manner affecting the system, then a provider shall
comply with chapter 12.16 of this title.
      2.   City Authority To Move System In Case Of An Emergency: The City may,
at any time, in case of fire, disaster or other emergency, as determined by the
City in its reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of the system and
appurtenances on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City, in which event
the City shall not be liable therefor to a provider. The City shall notify a
provider in writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon as

moving of such structure. A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any
person other than the City for any such movement of its systems.
      4.   Rights-Of-Way Change; Obligation To Move System: When the City is
changing a rights-of-way and makes a written request, a provider is required to
move or remove its system from the rights-of-way, without cost to the City.
This obligation does not apply to systems originally located on private
property pursuant to a private easement, which property was later incorporated
into the rights-of-way, if that private easement grants a superior vested
right. This obligation exists whether or not the provider has obtained an
excavation permit.
   E.   Protect Structures: In connection with the construction, maintenance,
repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider shall, at its own cost and
expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the City and all
designated landmarks, as well as all other structures within any designated
landmark district. A provider shall obtain the prior written consent of the
City to alter any water main, power facility, sewerage or drainage system, or
any other Municipal structure on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City
required because of the presence of the system. Any such alteration shall be
made by the City or its designee on a reimbursable basis. A provider agrees
that it shall be liable for the costs incurred by the City to replace or repair
and restore to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably specified
by the City, any Municipal structure or any other rights-of-way of the City
involved in the construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the
system that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by
or on behalf of a provider pursuant to the franchise.
   F.   No Obstruction: In connection with the construction, maintenance,
upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall not unreasonably
obstruct the rights-of-way of fixed guideway systems, railways, passenger
travel, or other traffic to, from or within the City without the prior consent
of the appropriate authorities.
   G.   Safety Precautions: A provider shall, at its own cost and expense,
undertake all necessary and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its
work sites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences,
barricades, security personnel and suitable and sufficient lighting, and such
other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable Federal, State and local requirements including, but not
limited to, the National Electrical Safety Code.
   H.   Repair: After written reasonable notice to the provider, unless, in the
sole determination of the City, an imminent danger exists, any rights-of-way
within the City which are disturbed or damaged during the construction,
maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may be repaired by
the City at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as that prevailing
before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the City shall submit to such a
provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the
rights-of-way intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the statement, pay to the City the entire amount thereof.
   I.   System Maintenance: A provider shall:
      1.   Install and maintain all parts of its system in a nondangerous
condition throughout the entire period of its franchise;
      2.   Install and maintain its system in accordance with standard prudent
engineering practices and shall conform, when applicable, with the National
Electrical Safety Code and all applicable other Federal, State and local laws
or regulations;
      3.   At all reasonable times, permit examination by any duly authorized
representative of the City of the system and its effect on the rights-of-way.
   J.   Trimming Of Trees: A provider shall have the authority to trim trees,
in accordance with all applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and easement
restrictions, upon and hanging over rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches
of such trees from coming in contact with its system. No tree owned and
maintained by the City shall be trimmed, removed or otherwise modified without
first notifying the Forestry Division of the City Power Department of the
intended work. Bona fide emergencies are not subject to this requirement.
   K.   Pole Attachment Make-Ready Work: If the City receives an application
for pole attachments from a person or company other than a specific provider
("third party attacher") which, in the reasonable judgment of the City,
necessitates make-ready work on the provider's attachments and for which the
third party attached is willing to pay the reasonable costs of the make-ready
work, the City or the third party attacher will furnish the provider with
written notice requesting the provider to perform the make- ready work within
ten (10) business days of the date of the written notice. If the provider fails
to perform the make-ready work within the ten (10) business day time limit,
then either the City or the third party attacher may, at its sole discretion,
choose a contractor that meets the objective engineering qualifications and
criteria established by the City to perform the make-ready work on behalf of
the provider, and the provider shall have no recourse against either the City
or the third party attacher. (Ord. 17-16)

      1.   PSC Approval: When a provider is the subject of a sale, transfer,
lease, assignment, sublease or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by
forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise,
such that it or its successor entity is obligated to inform or seek the
approval of the PSC, the provider or its successor entity shall promptly notify
the City of the nature of the transaction and, if applicable, request a
transfer of the franchise to the successor entity. A request for a transfer
shall include a certification that the successor entity unequivocally agrees to
all of the terms of the original provider's franchise agreement.
      2.   Transfer Of Franchise: Upon receipt of a request to transfer a
franchise, the City designee, as provided in subsection
12.14.090A1 of this chapter, may send notice approving the transfer of the
franchise to the successor entity. Such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If the City has reason to believe that the successor entity may not
comply with this chapter or the franchise agreement, it may require an
application for the transfer. The application shall comply with section
12.14.050 of this chapter.
   B.   Events Of Sale: The following events shall be deemed to be a sale,
assignment or other transfer of the franchise requiring compliance with

provider's assets to another person;
      2.   The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or
partnership, membership or other equity interests in a provider by one (1) or
more of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so

applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and
operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to
prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the City at all times
throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A
provider shall retain such records for not less than the applicable statute of
limitations.
   C.   Maintain Records: A provider shall at all times maintain:
      1.   On file with the City, a full and complete set of plans, records and
as built hard copy maps and, to the extent the maps are placed in an electronic
format, they shall be made in electronic format compatible with the City's
existing GIS system, of all existing and proposed installations and the types
of equipment and systems installed or constructed in the rights-of- way,
properly identified and described as to the types of equipment and facility by
appropriate symbols and marks which shall include annotations of all rights-of-
way where work will be undertaken. As used in this chapter, as built maps
include file construction prints. Maps shall be drawn to scale. As built maps,
including the compatible electronic format, as provided above, shall be
submitted within thirty (30) days of completion of work or within thirty (30)
days after completion of modification and repairs. As built maps are not
required of the provider who is the incumbent local exchange carrier for the
existing system to the extent they do not exist.
      2.   Throughout the term of the franchise, a provider shall maintain
complete and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership
and operations of a provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows
the City at all times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with
article 2 of the franchise agreement pertaining to finances. Should the City
reasonably determine that the records are not being maintained in such a
manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the books and/or records are
maintained so that a provider comes into compliance with this section. All
financial books and records which are maintained in accordance with the
regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that regulates utilities in
the State of Utah, and generally accepted accounting principles shall be deemed
to be acceptable under this section.
   D.   Confidentiality: If the information required to be submitted is
proprietary in nature or must be kept confidential by Federal, State or local
law, upon proper request by a provider, such information shall be classified as
a protected record within the meaning of the Utah Government Records Access and
Management Act (GRAMA), making it available only to those who must have access
to perform their duties on behalf of the City, provided that a provider
notifies the City of, and clearly labels the information which a provider deems
to be confidential, proprietary information. Such notification and labeling
shall be the sole responsibility of the provider.
   E.   Provider's Expense: All reports and records required under this chapter
shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter or a franchise. (Ord. 17-16)

expiration or revocation. A provider shall continue to operate its system under
the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant to
this chapter.

known address of provider; b) any system has been installed in the rights-of-
way without complying with the requirements of this chapter or franchise; or c)
the provisions of section

      2.   Removal Of Abandoned System: The City, upon such terms as it may
impose, may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing,

provided in this chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the
abandoned system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any
affected rights-of-way to their former state at the time such system was
installed, so as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant,
structures and equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense, any
excavation necessarily made by it and shall leave all rights-of-way in as good

expense, all aboveground portions of a system from the rights-of-way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty

not be required to remove its system, but shall negotiate a renewal in good
faith.
      5.   Leaving Underground System: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this chapter, a provider may abandon any underground system in
place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the rights-

any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law and all
appellate remedies with regard to the validity of the chapter provisions in
question are exhausted, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct
and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the
validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that
such law is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so

effect and shall again be binding on the City and the provider, provided that
the City shall give the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer period of time
as may be reasonably required for a provider to comply with such a rejuvenated
provision, written notice of the change before requiring compliance with such
provision.
   C.   New Developments: It shall be the policy of the City to liberally amend
this chapter, upon application of a provider, when necessary to enable the
provider to take advantage of any developments in the field of
telecommunications which will afford the provider an opportunity to more
effectively, efficiently or economically serve itself or the public.
   D.   Notices: All notices from a provider to the City required under this
chapter or pursuant to a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be

of the excavation. (Ord. 18-06)
12.16.020: PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   It is unlawful for a person not an employee of the Public Works
Department to make an excavation or road cut in a public street, lane or alley,
or to remove any pavement or other material forming any street or improvement
thereon, without a permit from the Public Works Department. Application for a
permit shall be filed with the Engineering Division of the Public Works
Department on a form or forms to be furnished by the City.
      1.   Bond Required: An applicant for a permit under this chapter shall be
required to file a surety bond to guarantee that the excavated street or public
right-of-way is restored or repaired by the applicant in accordance with City
specifications, or, if the repair work is done by the City, to guarantee
reimbursement to the City for that work, as provided in this chapter. The
amount of the bond shall be established by the Mayor in a written schedule in
accordance with the amount and cost of work to be performed. The written
schedule shall be available for public inspection in the Public Works

13.04.060: TERMINATION:
   A.   Delinquent Account:
      1.   When an account is a delinquent account, city, before termination,
shall issue a written late notice to inform the account holder of the
delinquent status. A late notice or reminder notice must include the following
information:
         a.   A statement that the account is a delinquent account and should
be paid promptly, and
         b.   A statement, together with the appropriate telephone numbers,
that the account holder should communicate with the collection department, by
calling the customer service office, if he/she has any question concerning the
account, and
         c.   A statement of the delinquent account balance, using a term such
as "delinquent account balance";
      2.   Where the account holder responds to a late notice or reminder
notice, the customer service personnel shall investigate any disputed issue and
shall attempt to resolve that issue by discussion. During this investigation
and discussion no other action shall be taken to terminate the residential
utility service if the account holder pays the undisputed portion of the
account.
   B.   Reasons For Termination:
      1.   Residential utility service may be terminated for the following
reasons:
         a.   Nonpayment of a delinquent account where the delinquent account
balance is more than ten dollars ($10.00), or
         b.   Nonpayment of a security deposit where required, or
         c.   Failure to comply with the terms of a deferred payment agreement
or a final order, or
         d.   Unauthorized use of or diversion of residential utility service
or tampering with wires, pipes, meters, or other equipment owned by the
utility, or
         e.   Subterfuge or deliberately furnishing false information for the
purpose of obtaining utility service, or
         f.   Failure to provide access to meter during the regular route visit
to the premises following proper notification and opportunity to make
arrangements in accordance with subsection
13.04.040B2 of this chapter,
         g.   Failure to make good a dishonored check which was tendered for
payment within forty eight (48) hours of notice, or
         h.   An unsafe condition that has been verified by the city building
inspection division. Service will only be restored when the unsafe condition is
remedied by the customer to the satisfaction of the city building inspection
division.
      2.   The following shall be insufficient grounds for termination of
service:
         a.   A delinquent account, accrued prior to the commencement of a
divorce or separate maintenance action in the courts, in the name of a former
spouse who was the principal wage earner, cannot be the basis for termination
of the current account holder's service,
         b.   Cohabitation of a current account holder with a delinquent
account holder who was previously terminated for nonpayment, unless the current
and delinquent account holders also cohabited during the time the delinquent
account holder received the utility service, whether such service was received
at the current account holder's present address or another address,
         c.   Where the delinquent account balance is less than ten dollars
($10.00), unless no payment has been made for two (2) months,
         d.   Failure to pay any amount in bona fide dispute presently before
the hearing officer,
         e.   Payment of delinquency for third party services billed by the
city utility, unless prior approval is obtained from the hearing officer.
   C.   Restrictions Upon Termination During Serious Illness:
      1.   Residential water, sewer and electric utility service may not be
terminated and will be restored if terminated where such termination will cause
or aggravate a serious illness or infirmity of a person living in the
residence. Utility service will be restored or continue for one month or less
as provided for in subsection C2 of this section;
      2.   Upon receipt of a physician's statement on the physician's
letterhead stationery, identifying the health infirmity or potential health
hazard, the city utility will continue or restore residential utility service
for the period set forth in the physician's statement or one month, whichever
is less; provided, however, that the person whose health is threatened or
illness aggravated petitions the hearing officer for an extension of time;
      3.   During the period of continued service, the account holder is liable
for the cost of residential utility service. However, no action to terminate
the service may be undertaken until expiration of the period of continued
service.
   D.   Restrictions Upon Termination To Residences With Life Supporting
Equipment: The city shall not terminate service to a residence in which the
account holder or a resident is known to be using an iron lung, respirator,
dialysis machine, or other life supporting equipment, without specific prior
approval by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any account holder eligible for
such protection can obtain it by filing a written notice with a doctor's
written statement with the utility. Thereupon, city utility shall mark and
identify all meter boxes, when applicable, at which such equipment is used.
   E.   Termination Without Notice: The city may terminate residential utility
service without notice where, in its judgment, a clear emergency or serious
health or safety hazard exists for so long as such condition exists, or where
there is unauthorized use of or diversions of residential utility service or
tampering with wires, pipes, meters, or other equipment owned by the utility.
The utility shall immediately attempt to notify the customer of the termination
and the reasons therefor.

the day of mailing of the notice.
         b.   Personal notification, such as a telephone conversation with the
termination party, or notification by first class mail is required and the
mailed forty eight (48) hour notice can be the final notice prior to the
termination. The mayor shall have the authority to order a moratorium on
termination of electrical service during periods of extreme cold temperatures.
         c.   If termination of service is not accomplished within fifteen (15)
days following the forty eight (48) hour notice, the utility will follow the

party notification procedure at the time of application for service and at
least once each year;
      4.   For all residential premises where a person other than the occupant
is the account holder and that fact is known, the City utility shall post a
notice of proposed termination on the premises in a conspicuous place and shall
make reasonable efforts to give actual notice to the occupants by personal
visits or other appropriate means at least five (5) calendar days prior to the
proposed termination. The posted notice shall contain the information specified
in subsection F1 of this section. This notice provision applies to residential
premises where: a) the account holder has requested termination, or b) the
account holder has a delinquent bill. If nonpayment is the basis for the
termination, the City utility shall also advise the tenants that they may
continue to receive utility service for an additional thirty (30) days by
paying the charges due for the thirty (30) day period just past.
   G.   Termination: Upon expiration of the notice of proposed termination, the
City utility may terminate residential utility service. Except in cases of

      2.   If at the end of five (5) calendar days the account is still
delinquent and no petition has been filed with the Hearing Officer, the
electric service may be terminated in its entirety until the delinquent account
is paid or a deferred payment agreement reached and all other fees are
satisfied.
   J.   Liability: The City will accept no liability for damages to customer's
property or facilities in the event discontinuance of service is required and
the termination procedures herein set forth have been complied with. (Ord. 11-

13.08.010: WATER SYSTEM FINANCIAL STANDARDS:
In order to maintain fiscal soundness of the Water Enterprise Fund, the
following financial standards are established:
   A.   Annual Transfer: Subject to approval of the annual final budget by the
City Council, there shall be, each fiscal year, an operational transfer to the
General Fund from the total operating revenues of the City's Water Enterprise
Fund as used and defined in the Utah Uniform Fiscal Procedures Act, to cover
the costs of City services provided to the Water Enterprise Fund. The City
Council may, at any time, modify the amount of transfer. Such transfer shall
not prohibit acts and other services being rendered to other departments of the
City.
   B.   Transfer For Administrative Services: Transfer for administrative
services to the General Fund shall be in an amount not to exceed the value of
the actual services rendered. Such amount shall be set not less than every five
(5) years by the City Council after the performance of an independent audit to
determine the value of service performed.
   C.   Investments, Cash And Cash Equivalents Reserves (Reserve): A Reserve
Fund shall be established within the Water Enterprise Fund. The minimum reserve
level for the Water Enterprise Fund (the "fund") is twenty five percent (25%)
of operating revenue ("reserve level"). This level of reserves provides the
minimum cash liquidity and operational stability in case of natural disasters,
equipment failure, economic uncertainty and weather variations. As a result of
one-time expenses, the reserve level may fluctuate, provided however that the
reserve level should not be drawn upon for ongoing operational expenses. If
reserves are drawn below the minimum reserve level, the fund will replenish
reserves to the reserve level within five (5) years. (Ord. 17-40)

13.30.020: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, preserve, and maintain
existing and potential public drinking water sources in order to safeguard the
public health, safety and welfare of customers and other users of the City's
public drinking water supply, distribution and delivery system. The intent of
this chapter is to establish and designate drinking water source protection
zones and ground water recharge areas for all underground sources of public
drinking water which enter the public's culinary drinking water supply,
distribution and delivery system, whether such sources are located within, or
outside of, the City's corporate boundaries. This chapter establishes criteria
for regulating the storage, handling, use or production of hazardous waste,
petroleum products and regulated substances within identified areas where
ground water is, or could be affected by the potential contaminant source. This
shall be accomplished by the designation and regulation of property uses and
conditions that may be maintained within such zones or areas.
   B.   This chapter shall not be construed to allow a permitted or a
conditional use except as that use may be provided in the zoning ordinance of
this Code. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate and/or prohibit
certain land uses which may be otherwise classified as permitted or conditional
uses under the zoning ordinance, and if the provisions of this chapter conflict
with the zoning ordinance in this regard, the more strict provisions of this
chapter shall apply.
   C.   The degree of protection afforded by this chapter is considered
adequate for regulatory purposes. This chapter does not ensure that public
drinking water sources will not be subject to accidental or intentional
contamination, nor does it create liability on the part of the City, or an
officer or employee thereof, for any damages to the public water supplies from
reliance on this chapter nor any administrative order lawfully made hereunder.
   D.   Compliance with the terms of this chapter shall not relieve the person
subject to the terms hereof of the obligation to comply with any other
applicable Federal, State, regional or local statute, regulation, rule,
ordinance or requirement. (Ord. 17-40)

   A.   Toxic, Hazardous And Other Materials Handling Regulations:
      1.   Storage Containers: All regulated substances, hazardous waste, and
petroleum products shall be stored in suitable containers to reduce the chance
for accidental introduction into the environment. These storage containers
shall be product tight and, except where provided elsewhere in this chapter,
shall be provided with a means to control spillage and to contain or drain off
spillage and fire protection water discharged in the storage area. Storage
containers and secondary containment areas must be covered and/or elevated to
prevent the accumulation of rain or other water. Defective storage containers
shall be removed from service for repair or disposal in accordance with local,
State, and Federal standards.
      2.   Secondary Containment: Secondary containment shall be constructed of
a material of sufficient structural integrity and composition to contain the
required capacity of liquids and not be structurally weakened as a result of
contact with the discharge of the regulated substance, hazardous waste or
petroleum product to be contained. The material shall be free of cracks,
joints, gaps, or other imperfections which would allow leakage through the
containment material.
The secondary containment system shall have sufficient capacity to contain: a)
ten percent (10%) of the volume of all containers and one hundred percent
(100%) of the volume of the largest single container, whichever is greater,
plus b) the design flow rate of the automatic fire extinguishing system (for 20
minutes) for the area or room in which the storage is located. If the storage
area and/or containment area are open to rainfall, the secondary containment
system must also accommodate the volume of a twenty four (24) hour rainfall as
determined by a 25-year storm frequency. Liquid that accumulates in the
secondary containment system shall be removed in as timely a manner as
necessary to prevent overflow of the system. Nonhazardous liquids may be
drained in accordance with applicable local regulations. If the collected
material is a hazardous waste under title 40, part 261 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, it must be managed as a hazardous waste in accordance with all
applicable requirements of parts 262 through 266 of that regulation.
Vacuum suction devices, absorbent scavenger materials or other devices approved
by the department shall be present on-site or available to facilitate the
removal or further containment of a spill. Devices or materials shall be
available in sufficient magnitude so as to at least control and collect the
total quantity of regulated substances, hazardous waste and petroleum products
that the containment system is designed to contain. Emergency containers shall
be present and of such capacity as to hold the total quantity of regulated
substances plus absorbent material.
      3.   Emergency Management Plan: An emergency plan shall be prepared and
filed with the Health Department, the City Fire and Police Departments and the
Public Works Department indicating the procedures that will be followed in the
event of the release of a regulated substance, hazardous waste or petroleum
product so as to control and collect all such spilled material in such a manner
as to prevent it from discharging into any storm or sanitary drains or the
ground. A facility or property which has had, or appears to have had,
unauthorized discharges to soil or ground water shall submit a regulated
substances management plan for the facility if required by the department. The
written plan will be used to demonstrate to the department that the facility
owner or operator understands the procedures and has the proper equipment to
handle regulated substances, hazardous waste and petroleum products within the
guidelines of this chapter. The plan may not be implemented without the
approval of the department.
      4.   Reporting Of Spills: Any spill of a regulated substance in excess of
the nonaggregate quantity thresholds established by the list of hazardous waste
(40 CFR part 261, subpart D), and 40 CFR appendix VII-hazardous constituents
and EPA designation reportable quantities and notification requirements for
hazardous substances under CERCLA (40 CFR 302, effective July 3, 1986), shall
be reported by telephone to the City and designated water utility within one
hour of discovery of the spill. Cleanup shall commence immediately upon
discovery of the spill. A full written report shall be submitted to the Public
Works Department and the Health Department within fifteen (15) days of
discovery of the spill.
   B.   Best Management Practices: Under the provisions of this chapter, all
persons having control or ownership of potential contamination sources shall
incorporate and utilize Best Management Practices (BMPs) in their operations.
BMPs that reduce the potential for spills and leaks at a site to occur and
enter ground water shall be construed within the context of this chapter to
include, but not be limited to, structural and nonstructural practices,
conservation practices, and operation and maintenance procedures as specified
by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. BMPs outlined in section
13.30.150, appendix B of this chapter supplement those provided in this
subsection. It is the responsibility of the applicant to comply with the most
recent, updated version of BMP provisions.
      1.   Underground Storage Tanks: Installation of any new underground
storage tanks (USTs) used to store regulated substances, hazardous waste or
petroleum products for either residential or nonresidential activities in
recharge areas and protection zones designated pursuant to this chapter, shall
require a secondary containment system for the tank and associated underground
piping, and an automatic leak detection system. A permit from the Utah State
Division of Environmental Remediation and Response shall be required for the
removal or closure of USTs. The permit shall require that leaking tanks be
pumped dry and removed from the ground by a State licensed company. If removal
of the UST(s) is not feasible, the lines shall be disconnected and capped and
the tank shall be filled with an inert substance such as washed sand. Best
Management Practices implementation is required for all USTs.

Utah State Department of Health "care of waste disposal regulations", part IV
and part V. Nonresidential activities which have septic tank systems shall have
installed a four inch (4") diameter vertical pipe and shall be located in a
manner which will permit ready access by department personnel to extract
representative samples to check for improper or unauthorized disposal of
regulated substances, hazardous waste or petroleum products. A septic holding
tank that does not discharge into the soil is preferred. The contents of a
septic holding tank are removed, and can be treated or disposed of at an
appropriate facility.
      3.   Sewage Collection, Transmission And Disposal: No person may
discharge treated or untreated sewage in any area not specifically designated
for that purpose by the department. The owner or operators of any wastewater
treatment plant, sanitary sewer, force main, gravity sewer, or lateral shall
notify the department within twenty four (24) hours of discovering a break that
may or does result in the leakage of sewage. Emergency telephone numbers will
be prominently displayed on all sewage lift stations within Zones 1, 2, 3, 4,
and the primary recharging area. All leaking sewage collection and transmission
pipes shall be promptly repaired or replaced. New sewage collection and
transmission pipes shall be installed according to acceptable construction

action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   B.   Consent Orders: The Director is hereby empowered to enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any regulated person responsible for
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
regulated person. Consent orders shall be judicially enforceable.
   C.   Order To Show Cause Hearing: The Director may order any regulated
person which causes or contributes to violation(s) of any provisions of this
chapter, or any order, rule or regulation issued or promulgated hereunder, to
appear before the Director and show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the regulated person, which
notice shall specify the time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the
regulated person show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Such written notice shall be served in person on any authorized
representative of the regulated person, or by certified mail, return receipt
requested, at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing. Whether or not the
regulated person appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be
pursued following the hearing date. A hearing to show cause shall not be a
prerequisite for taking any other actions against the regulated person.
   D.   Compliance Orders: If the Director finds that a regulated person has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, or any rule or
regulation issued or promulgated hereunder, the Director may issue an order to
the regulated person responsible for the violation directing that the regulated
person come into compliance within thirty (30) days. If the regulated person
does not come into compliance within thirty (30) days, any and all available
remedies may be pursued, including, if necessary to prevent an actual or
imminent discharge which may contaminate the ground water, discontinuing water
and/or water service to the regulated person as provided in subsection F of
this section. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address
noncompliance, including additional self- monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants released. A compliance order may
not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Federal standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order release the regulated person of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against
the regulated person.
   E.   Cease And Desist Orders: If the Director finds that a regulated person
is violating any provision of this chapter, any rule or regulation issued or
promulgated hereunder, or that the regulated person's past violations are
likely to recur, the Director may issue an order to the regulated person
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
regulated person to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation. Issuance of a cease
and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against
the regulated person.
   F.   Emergency Suspension Of Utility Service: The Director may order the
immediate shutoff of affected utilities and suspension of a regulated person's
actions (after informal notice to the regulated person), whenever such
suspension or shutoff is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause a risk of an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the ground water or the health or welfare of the
City's culinary water customers. Any regulated person notified of a suspension
of its activities shall immediately stop conducting such activities. If a
regulated person fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary to enforce such
order. The Director shall allow the regulated person to recommence operations
when the regulated person has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director
that the period of endangerment has passed. A regulated person that is
responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment, shall submit to the Director a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, prior to the date of any show cause hearing
under this section, if applicable. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted
as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   G.   Injunctive Relief: If a regulated person has violated or continues to
violate a provision of this chapter or continues to violate any order, rule or
regulation issued or promulgated hereunder, the City may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction,
as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
ordinance provision, order, rule, regulation or other requirement. In addition,
the City may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses
of litigation by appropriate legal action against the regulated person found to
have violated any provision hereof, or of any order, or any other rule or
regulation issued or promulgated hereunder. Such other action as appropriate
for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by the City. A petition
for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other
action against a regulated person.
   H.   Civil Fine Pass-Through Recovery: If a regulated person releases such
pollutants which cause the City to violate any applicable laws, rules or
regulations to which the City is subject, and the City is fined or held liable
regarding such violations, the regulated person shall be fully liable for the
total amount of the fines and civil penalties assessed against the City and any
administrative costs or interest incurred. The City may commence a civil
proceeding to collect amounts due the City under this subsection.
   I.   Public Nuisances: A violation of the provision of this chapter, or of
any order, rule or regulation issued or promulgated hereunder, is hereby
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the
Director. A person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the
provisions of applicable laws governing nuisances, including reimbursement to
the City for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying the nuisance.
   J.   Enforcement By Other Agencies: The City may request the Health
Department, and the Health Department is hereby granted the authority upon such
request, to enforce or administer the provisions of this chapter and to
prosecute any violations thereof. To the extent of any such request, references
in this chapter to the department and the City shall be deemed to mean the
Health Department, and references in this chapter to the Director shall be
deemed to mean the Director of the Health Department. In addition, the City may
refer to the State of Utah or the Federal government, for civil or criminal
prosecution, any violations of this chapter which also violate applicable
provisions of State or Federal law, orders, administrative rules or permits. It
is the intent of the City that this chapter shall be construed to the greatest
extent possible to be consistent with the provisions of applicable County,
State and Federal laws, ordinances, rules, regulations and permits. In the
event of a conflict, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
   K.   Nonexclusive Remedies: The provisions of subsections A through J of
this section are not exclusive remedies. The City reserves the right to take
any, all, or any combination of these actions against a regulated person as
circumstances warrant. The City is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against a regulated person for each separate violation of this chapter,
which actions may be taken concurrently. Each day a violation of this chapter
continues is deemed to be a separate violation. (Ord. 17-40)
13.30.130: INSPECTION AUTHORITY:
When necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this
chapter, or when the Director has reasonable cause to believe that there exists
upon any property or on or in any facility located thereon any condition which
violates this chapter, the Director is authorized to enter such property or
facility during normal business hours in the case of a business or commercial
use, or in the case of a residential property or facility, during daylight
hours, to inspect the same or to perform any duty authorized by this chapter;
provided that if such property or facility is occupied, the Director shall
first present credentials and demand entry; and if such property or facility is
unoccupied, the Director shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the
owner or other persons having charge or control of the property or facilities
and demand entry. If entry is denied, the Director shall have recourse to every
remedy provided by law to obtain entry.
If the owner or occupant denies entry, the Director is authorized to obtain an
administrative search warrant or other warrant provided by law to obtain entry.
Owners, occupants or any other persons having the charge, care or control of
property or facilities shall, after proper request is made as provided herein,
promptly admit the Director for the purpose of inspection pursuant to this
chapter. (Ord. 17-40)
13.30.140: CRIMINAL PENALTY:
A violation of any provision of this chapter is a Class B misdemeanor. Each day
a violation is committed or permitted to continue constitutes a separate
violation. (Ord. 17-40)

APPENDIX B
   List Of Potential Contamination Sources And Best Management Practices
The following table identifies uses which have varying potentials to
contaminate ground water sources. These uses have been classified according to
the risk of contamination in each protection zone as follows:
Permitted Uses (P) - The risk of contamination is considered relatively low in
the specified zone if regulatory requirements and Best Management Practices are
implemented and, therefore, the use is permitted if it otherwise conforms to
the zoning ordinance, chapter 17, of this Code.
Conditional Uses (C) - The risk of contamination is moderate in the specified
zone. The use may be permitted only after conditional use review and approval
by the Planning Commission if the use otherwise conforms to the zoning
ordinance, chapter 17, of this Code and to State law. Approval is subject to
implementation of Best Management Practices and compliance with other
reasonable conditions as may be established by the Planning Commission.
Prohibited Uses (X) - The risk of contamination is very high in the specified
zone. The use is not permitted regardless of any other provision of the zoning
ordinance, chapter 17, of this Code.

and other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the Public Works Director or designee according to plans on file in
the City and shall be located as to be readily accessible for cleaning by user
and inspection by the City.
   B.   All grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be constructed of
impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in
temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped
with easily removable covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gas and
water tight.

CHAPTER 13.48
STORMWATER UTILITY
SECTION:
13.48.010: Findings
13.48.020: Purpose
13.48.030: Definitions
13.48.040: Stormwater Utility Established
13.48.050: Stormwater Utility Fee
13.48.055: Stormwater Impact Fees
13.48.060: Stormwater Financial Standards
13.48.010: FINDINGS:
   A.   The City owns and operates a stormwater system and facilities
("system") which have been developed over many years.
   B.   The system consists of a network of structures, conduits and ditches,
including ground water, that collect and route stormwater runoff.
   C.   Existing stormwater drainage conditions may constitute a potential
hazard to the health, safety and general welfare of the City, its residents and
businesses unless effectively maintained, replaced, improved, operated,
regulated and controlled.
   D.   Anticipated growth and further wear and tear on the system will place
increased demands on the system.
   E.   Stormwater runoff carries concentrations of oil, grease, nutrients,
chemicals, heavy metals, toxic materials and other material that may jeopardize
the integrity of ground waters and receiving waters, including the City's
culinary water supply.
   F.   Inadequate management of both the quantity and quality of stormwater
runoff may:
      1.   Increase pollution levels in creeks, rivers and ground water;
      2.   Cause flooding, erosion and property damage;
      3.   Hinder the provision of emergency services to residents;
      4.   Impede traffic flow;
      5.   Degrade the integrity of City streets and other utilities; and
      6.   Pose health hazards to residents.
   G.   The City is required under Federal and State mandates to provide
increased quantity and quality controls to mitigate the impacts of pollutants
that may be discharged from the system.
   H.   Developed property contributes to the need for the system by altering
natural conditions with impervious surfaces. All developed properties, whether
public or private, make use of or benefit from the City's operation and
maintenance of, and improvements to, the system.
   I.   Impervious area is an important factor influencing stormwater service
requirements and costs posed by properties, and therefore is an appropriate
factor for calculating stormwater utility fees.
   J.   The future usefulness of the system, including any additions and
improvements, and the capability of the City to comply with Federal and State
mandates, depends on the ability of the City to effectively manage, protect,
control, regulate, use, and enhance the system. In order to do so, the City
must have adequate and stable funding for its Stormwater Management Program
operating and capital investment needs.
   K.   A stormwater utility is the most equitable and efficient method of
managing stormwater and ensuring that each property pays its fair share of the
amount that the property contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the
system.
   L.   A stormwater utility fee is properly labeled a service fee similar to
water, lighting, and sewer charges.
   M.   A monthly charge imposed for the use of the system constitutes a fee
for services, not an assessment. (Ord. 17-40)
13.48.020: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
City and its inhabitants by efficiently operating the City's system, managing
and controlling stormwater runoff, protecting property, preventing polluted
waters from entering the City's water supply and other receiving waters, and
establishing a viable and fair method of financing the improvement, operation
and maintenance of the system. (Ord. 17-40)
13.48.030: DEFINITIONS:
For purposes of this chapter:
DEVELOPED PARCEL: Means any parcel that has been altered from its natural
conditions by grading, filling, or the construction of improvements or other
impervious surfaces.
EQUIVALENT RESIDENTIAL UNIT OR ERU: Means the average amount of impervious
surface, expressed in square feet, on developed single-family residential
parcels in the City. One ERU equals three thousand four hundred (3,400) square
feet of impervious surface.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE: Means any hard surface, other than the natural surface,
that prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil, or that causes
water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at greater rates of flow
than the natural surface. (Ord. 17-40)
13.48.040: STORMWATER UTILITY ESTABLISHED:
   A.   Creation: There is hereby created and established a stormwater utility
operating within the City's Public Works Department.
   B.   Enterprise Fund: There is hereby established a Stormwater Utility
Enterprise Fund to handle all income, expenses and other financial transactions
related to the stormwater utility. All stormwater utility charges shall be
deposited in the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund. Impact fees, provided for
in chapter 13.06 of this title relating to the system shall also be deposited
in the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund. Impact fees shall be deposited in
separate interest bearing ledger accounts, not commingled with any other funds,
and shall only be used for expenditures enumerated in section
13.06.110 of this title and title 11, chapter 36a of the Utah Code. Funds in
the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund shall not be commingled with other City
funds and may be transferred to other City funds only as allowed under title
10, chapter 6 and title 11, chapter 36a of the Utah Code. The Stormwater
Utility Enterprise Fund shall be operated according to State law and City
policy.
   C.   Facilities And Assets: The stormwater utility shall operate
independently of City operations funded by the General Fund. The stormwater
utility shall have the same relationship to the City as other City utilities,
such as the water utility and the power utility. Upon creation of the utility,
all of the City's stormwater facilities and assets (other than streets and
other facilities designated by the Mayor or the Mayor's designee) were
transferred to the stormwater utility in consideration for the stormwater
utility's agreement to take primary responsibility for planning, designing,
constructing, maintaining, administering and operating the City's stormwater
system.
   D.   Administration: The stormwater utility shall be administered by the
Public Works Director or designee. (Ord. 18-06: Ord. 17-40)

   A.   Imposed: Each developed parcel of real property shall be charged a
stormwater utility fee.
   B.   ERU: The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent residential
units (ERUs) contained in the parcel. An ERU is the average amount of
impervious area in a single-family parcel and was determined by a statistical
study of residential parcels in the City. The study utilized digital aerial
photography to delineate and measure impervious areas within a residential
sample area. Based on this study, one ERU equals three thousand four hundred
(3,400) square feet of impervious surface area.
   C.   Calculation: Each single-family residential parcel and each duplex
parcel contributes approximately the same amount of stormwater runoff;
therefore, each developed single-family residential parcel and each duplex
parcel shall pay a base rate of one ERU. All nonsingle-family and nonduplex
residential parcels shall pay a multiple of this base rate, expressed in ERUs,
according to the measured impervious area on the parcel. Total ERUs are
calculated by dividing the total square feet of impervious surface by three
thousand four hundred (3,400) (1 ERU).
   D.   Charge Per ERU: The monthly charge for each ERU shall be in accordance
with the following schedule.  Monthly rates go into effect on July 1 of each
fiscal year.
 
Fiscal Year                                 Fee
Thru FY2020                                 $4.65
FY2021                                      $5.65
FY2022                                      $6.30
FY2023                                      $6.95
FY2024                                      $7.60
FY2025, continuing thereafter until amended $8.25

based on implementing source or treatment controls which reduce or eliminate
pollutants from the user's stormwater runoff before it enters the City system.
Stormwater quality must meet or exceed City standards to qualify for a credit;
and/or
         b.   Reducing the quantity of the user's site stormwater discharged
into the City's system. Discharge rate must be equal to or less than City
standard to qualify for a credit.
   F.   Policies: The Public Works Director may adopt policies to assist
applying, administering, and interpreting this chapter or other provisions
related to the stormwater utility.
   G.   Appeals: Any person or entity that believes that this chapter, or any
stormwater utility fee or impervious surface measurement, was interpreted or
applied erroneously may appeal to the Public Works Director ("Director"). The
appeal shall be in writing, shall state any facts supporting the appeal, and
shall be made within ten (10) days of the decision, action, or bill being
appealed. The Director may elect to hold a hearing on the appeal. The Director
shall decide the appeal within ten (10) days of when the appeal is filed. Any
person or entity aggrieved by the decision of the Director may appeal to the

area for purposes of the imposition of the stormwater impact fees.
   C.   The Public Works Director, subject to approval by the City Council, may
authorize an adjustment in the standard stormwater impact fee at the time the
fee is charged to:
      1.   Respond to unusual circumstances in specific cases;
      2.   Respond to a request for a prompt and individualized impact fee
review for the development activity of the State, a school district, or a
charter school and an offset or credit for a public facility for which an
impact fee has been or will be collected; and
      3.   Ensure that impact fees are imposed fairly.
   D.   The Public Works Director's review under subsection C of this section,
subject to approval by the City Council, of the calculation and the adjustment,
if any, in the amount of an impact fee may be based, in whole or in part, on
studies and data submitted by the developer.
   E.   A developer, including a school district or a charter school, may
receive a credit against or a proportionate reimbursement of an impact fee if
the developer:
      1.   Dedicates land for a system improvement;
      2.   Builds and dedicates some or all of a system improvement; or
      3.   Dedicates a public facility that the City and the developer agree
will reduce the need for a system improvement.
   F.   There shall be a credit against impact fees for any dedication of land
for, improvement to, or new construction of, any system improvements provided
by the developer if the facilities:
      1.   Are system improvements; or
      2.   a. Are dedicated to the public; and
         b.   Offset the need for an identified system improvement.
   G.   For purposes of this chapter, new development shall include remodeling,
building enlargement, or any other construction or improvement which will place
an increased burden on the City stormwater system.
   H.   A person or entity may petition for impact fee refunds, or challenge
and appeal impact fees in accordance with title 11 chapter 36a of the Utah
Code, and chapter 13.06 of this title. (Ord. 18-06: Ord. 17-40)
13.48.060: STORMWATER FINANCIAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Annual Transfer: Subject to the approval of the final annual budget by
the City Council, there shall be, each fiscal year, an operational transfer
from the City's Stormwater Fund operating revenue to the City's General Fund as
used and defined in the Uniform Fiscal Procedures Act. The City Council may, at
any time, modify the operational transfer. The operational transfers shall not
prohibit acts and other services being rendered to other departments of the
City.
   B.   Transfer For Administrative Services: Transfer for administrative
services to the General Fund shall be in an amount not to exceed the value of
the actual services rendered. Such amount shall be set not less than every five
(5) years by the City Council after the performance of an independent audit to
determine the value of the service performed.
   C.   Investments, Cash And Cash Equivalents Reserves (Reserve): The minimum
reserve level for the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund (the "fund") is twenty
five percent (25%) of operating revenue ("reserve level"). This level of
reserves provides the minimum cash liquidity and operational stability in case
of natural disasters, equipment failure, economic uncertainty and weather
variations. As a result of onetime expenses, the reserve level may fluctuate,
provided however that the reserve level should not be drawn upon for ongoing
operational expenses. If reserves are drawn below the minimum reserve level,
the fund will replenish reserves to the reserve level within five (5) years.

resubmitted with a stormwater system management plan. (Ord. 17-40)
13.52.050: STORMWATER SYSTEM DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Stormwater System Design Or BMP Manual: The City adopts as its
stormwater system design and Best Management Practices manual, the "Murray City
Storm Drain Guidance Manual" ("BMP manual" or "manual"). This manual includes a
list of acceptable BMPs including the specific design performance criteria and
operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater system practice. The
manual may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the
division, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local
maintenance experience. Stormwater management facilities that are designed,
constructed and maintained in accordance with these BMP criteria will be
presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.
   B.   General Performance Criteria For Stormwater System Management: Unless
granted a waiver or judged by the division to be exempt, the following
performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater system management at all
sites:
      1.   All site designs shall control the peak flow rates of stormwater
discharge associated with design storms specified in this chapter or in the BMP
manual and reduce the generation of post-construction stormwater runoff to
preconstruction levels. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas
for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate, after appropriate pretreatment,
stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity;
      2.   To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel
protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the BMP manual;
      3.   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources,
e.g., recharge areas, may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may
need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater system management practices;
      4.   Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land
disturbing permits shall consult with the division to determine if they are
subject to additional stormwater system design requirement; and
      5.   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the BMP
manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater management facilities.
   C.   Minimum Control Requirements:
      1.   Stormwater system designs shall meet the multistage storm frequency
storage requirements as identified in the BMP manual unless the division has
granted the applicant a full or partial waiver for a particular BMP under
section
13.52.040 of this chapter.
      2.   If hydrological or topographic conditions warrant greater control
than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the division may impose
any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume,
timing, and rate of space runoff.
   D.   Stormwater System Management Requirements: The stormwater system
management plan shall include sufficient information to allow the division to
evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential
impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on
the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures
proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. To accomplish
this goal the stormwater system management plan shall include the following:
      1.   Topographic Base Map: A one inch equals two hundred foot (1" = 200')
topographic map of the site which extends to a minimum of five hundred feet
(500') beyond the limits of the proposed development and indicates:
         a.   Existing surface water drainage including streams, ponds,
culverts, ditches, sinkholes, wetlands; and the type, size, elevation, etc., of
nearest upstream and downstream drainage structures;
         b.   Current land use including all existing structures, locations of
utilities, roads, and easements;
         c.   All other existing significant natural and artificial features;
         d.   Proposed land use with tabulation of the percentage of surface
area to be adapted to various uses; drainage patterns; locations of utilities,
roads and easements; the limits of clearing and grading;
         e.   Proposed structural BMPs; and
         f.   A written description of the site plan and justification of
proposed changes in natural conditions.
      2.   Calculations: Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations for the
predevelopment and post-development conditions for the design storms specified
in the BMP manual. These calculations must show that the proposed stormwater
system management measures are capable of controlling runoff from the site in
compliance with this chapter and the guidelines of the BMP manual. Such
calculations shall include:
         a.   A description of the design storm frequency, duration and
intensity where applicable;
         b.   Time of concentration;
         c.   Soil curve number or runoff coefficients including assumed soil
moisture conditions;
         d.   Peak runoff rates and total runoff volumes for each watershed
area;
         e.   Infiltration rates, where applicable;
         f.   Culvert, stormwater, ditch and/or other stormwater conveyance
capacities;
         g.   Flow velocities;
         h.   Data on the increase in rate and volume of runoff for the design
storms referenced in the BMP manual; and
         i.   Documentation of sources for all computation methods and filed
test results.
      3.   Soils Information: If a stormwater system management control measure
depends on the hydrologic properties of soil (e.g., infiltration basins), then
a soils report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site
boring logs or soil pit profiles and soil survey reports. The number and
location of required soil borings or soil pits shall be determined based on
what is needed to determine suitability and distribution of soil types present
at the location of the control measure.
      4.   Maintenance And Repair Plan: The design and planning of all
stormwater management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair
procedures to ensure their continued performance. These plans shall identify
the parts or components of a stormwater management facility that need to be
maintained and the equipment and skills or training necessary. Provisions for
the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance
program and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall
be included in the plan. A permanent elevation bench mark shall be identified
in the plans to assist in the periodic inspection of the facility.
      5.   Landscaping Plan: The applicant must present a detailed plan for
management of vegetation at the site after construction is finished, including
who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what
practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is
preserved. Where it is required by the BMP, this plan must be prepared by a
registered landscape architect licensed in Utah.
      6.   Maintenance Easements: The applicant shall ensure access to the site
for the purpose of inspection and repair by securing all the maintenance
easements needed. These easements must be binding on the property owner and all
subsequent owners of the property and must be properly recorded with the County
Recorder.
      7.   Maintenance Agreement:
         a.   The owner of property to be served by an on-site stormwater
management facility must execute an inspection and maintenance agreement that
shall operate as a deed restriction binding on the property owner and all
subsequent property owners.
         b.   The maintenance agreement shall:
            (1)   Assign responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the
stormwater management facility to the owner of the property upon which the
facility is located and be recorded as such on the plat for the property by
appropriate notation;
            (2)   Provide for annual inspection by the property owner for the
purpose of documenting maintenance and report needs and ensure compliance with
the purpose and requirements of this chapter. The property owner will arrange
for this inspection to be conducted by a qualified person who will submit a
sealed report of the inspection to the division. It shall also grant permission
to the City to enter the property at reasonable times and to inspect the

provide and install a complete single-phase temporary service loop assembly,
including meter base and disconnect panel, with an outlet providing two hundred
forty (240) volts, thirty (30) amperes and a duplex one hundred twenty (120)
volt outlet from a twenty (20) ampere breaker with GFI protection. Preassembled
meter loops are stocked in limited quantities and are available on a first
request basis. The City may install, at its sole discretion, customer owned
meter loops if the equipment meets City standards and is offered by the
customer.
      2.   A fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) is required for each temporary
service connection and disconnection. No fee will be charged for an extension
agreement if adequate service is available.
      3.   The account holder will be billed ten dollars ($10.00) each month
for rental of the service loop assembly in addition to the monthly bill for
energy delivered under the applicable general service rate schedule. If a
customer owned meter loop is used, rent will not be charged.
      4.   The City will remove the meter loop upon notification by the account
holder that temporary service is no longer wanted. Temporary service may be
discontinued by the City if the account is inactive for one hundred eighty
(180) consecutive days.
   B.   If a temporary service request is of a specialized nature or if
adequate service is not available, temporary service may be provided at the
discretion of the City in accordance with the following terms:
      1.   The account holder must agree to pay, in advance, the estimated net
cost of temporary electrical service. That cost includes line work, such as
additional poles, wire, transformers, conduits, and primary or secondary boxes,
and all other related material and labor costs, and shall include
administration overhead. The estimated net cost shall include the cost of
installing and removing the facilities. Cost estimate will be provided by the
City. The account holder is not entitled to any refund for this additional work
when the temporary service is terminated.
   C.   Unauthorized temporary service loop assemblies may not be installed on
or connect to the City's power system.

received final zoning and site plan approval, and
         a.   A building permit application has been filed with the City and is
pending approval; or
         b.   A building permit has been issued for the project.
      2.   If a building permit application is formally rejected, or if a
building permit is revoked or is otherwise declared invalid by the City for any
reason, temporary service for the project shall be immediately terminated.

15.20.040: UNDERGROUND SERVICE TO RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS:
   A.   Existing Residential Premises:
      1.   A residential subdivision property owner may request the City to
convert existing overhead service to underground service, which, if approved,
shall be at the owner's sole expense. If the City determines the conversion is
feasible, the owner shall pay the estimated cost of the conversion. The
estimated cost shall include an administrative overhead cost. After receiving
payment, the City shall perform the underground conversion work. If the actual
cost of installation exceeds the estimated cost, the owner shall immediately
reimburse the City for the additional cost. Unpaid installation costs shall be
charged to the electric power account for the premises and collected
accordingly. If the estimated amount paid by the property owner exceeds the
actual cost, the excess amount shall be refunded to the property owner.
      2.   If the City, in its sole discretion, determines that a particular
conversion request would also enhance efficient service delivery or provide
desired advantage or convenience for the City, the City may agree to share some
portion of the cost of the conversion. Nothing in this section requires the
City to negotiate or approve any cost sharing agreement with any property
owner.
      3.   The owner of an existing residential property which is not part of a
platted residential subdivision may request a conversion to underground
electric service. The City may grant the request under the same criteria,
conditions, and requirements as in the case of a platted lot, if the City
determines that the parcel is substantially similar to a subdivided lot in
size, configuration, and has similar public utility easements and the
underground service conversion is reasonably feasible.
   B.   Proposed Residential Subdivisions: The City shall provide underground
electric power to a new subdivision if requested by the developer. The request
must be made before the proposed plat is scheduled for preliminary approval
from the planning commission.
   C.   Easements Required: The owner of residential property shall provide
underground and other power utility easements to accommodate the underground
electrical service. The easements shall be sufficient to allow the City to
install, operate, and maintain electrical facilities to the point of connection
on each dwelling. The point of connection is that point of termination of power
service conductors at the meter base or main service breaker, as the case may
be. The City must approve the location of the meter or main service breaker.
The City is not responsible for the connection of service conductors to the
meter base or main service breaker.
   D.   Authority Of Power Department: The City has the sole authority to
design, install, operate, and maintain all underground facilities located in or
under residential parcels in the City. The City's responsibility for
underground electric service to a dwelling ends at the point of connection at
the dwelling. (Ord. 16-17)

responsibility of the property owner. A private property owner may request the
City to design and install privately owned street or area lighting at the sole
expense of the private property owner. The cost shall include administrative
overhead. The owner shall pay the total estimated cost to the City before the
City commences any work. Actual construction costs in excess of the original
estimate are payable as billed at the conclusion of the installation. Unpaid
reimbursement shall be charged to the initial electric power account billing
for the lighting system and shall be collected accordingly. The private street
lighting system shall be metered and the owner of the system shall be
responsible for all energy, operation and maintenance costs.
   C.   Streetside lighting facilities located on residential subdivision lots
which were installed by the City prior to January 1, 1994, under the provisions
of this section, shall remain the property of and the responsibility of the
City. (Ord. 16-17)

15.20.240: ELECTRIC SERVICE SCHEDULE 30; SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT (SCA):
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to enable the City to recover
the actual costs incurred in generating and purchasing electric power for use
by its customers. The supply cost adjustment ("SCA") amount is determined by
comparing the City's actual monthly power supply costs to an established base
cost. If power supply costs significantly exceed projections, a surcharge will
be applied on the customer's applicable monthly bill, subject to limitations
imposed by the special conditions set forth in subsection D of this section.
      1.   The SCA is capped at $0.005/kWh for an individual customer in any
single month;
      2.   The total recoverable amount during a single fiscal year cannot
exceed two percent (2%) of the Power Department's total budgeted revenue;
      3.   The minimum recoverable amount in any given month in order to
activate an actual SCA collection from the customers is fifty thousand dollars
($50,000.00);
      4.   If the SCA is collected from customers for six (6) consecutive
months, then the City Council will review the SCA and other applicable rates;
and
      5.   The Mayor shall approve and notify the City Council prior to
implementing an SCA collection from the customers.
   B.   Applicability: The SCA is applicable to electric service furnished
under all rate schedules incorporating this electric service schedule 30 -
supply cost adjustment.
   C.   SCA Formula And Definitions: The formula for the SCA shall be as
follows:
 
       SCA = (S-B) x I + C
        P
Where:
       Supply cost adjustment surcharge, expressed in $/kWh, to the nearest
SCA =  $0.00001, and applied to all kWh sales to retail customers of the City
       for the applicable retail billing month.
    
       Actual system cost of supply, expressed in $/kWh, the core costs for all
S   =  purchased and self- generated power for the applicable wholesale power
       procurement month, divided by the total system input energy.
    
B   =  Base cost of supply, the projected core cost per kWh of purchased and
       self-generated power and energy, currently established at $0.04500/kWh.
    
       Total system input energy, expressed in kWh, the energy produced or
I   =  purchased in association with the applicable wholesale power procurement
       month, multiplied by a line loss adjustment factor of 1.043 for system
       distribution and transmission line energy losses.
    
       Carried forward amount, the dollar amount carried forward from previous
C   =  months, either positive or negative, due to circumstances defined below
       in special conditions.
    
       Projected energy sales, expressed in kWh, as determined by trending
P   =  analysis for growth and seasonality, for the applicable retail billing
       month.
 
   D.   Special Conditions:
      1.   The SCA surcharge shall be capped at $0.005/kWh in any one month
with the remaining recoverable portion carried forward into succeeding months.
      2.   The minimum recoverable amount in any given month will be fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000.00). Uncollected, but recoverable, amounts under
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) will be carried forward into future months'
SCA analyses and calculations.
      3.   Monthly SCA calculations may result in recoverable amounts not
collected due to limitations detailed in this section. These uncollected
amounts shall be tracked in an SCA "bank" as a debit. Monthly SCA calculations
may also result in a negative amount, in which case it will be added to the
"bank" as a credit. The net amount in the "bank" becomes the carried forward
amount and is applied to future months' SCA calculations, except as outlined in
subsection D4 of this section.
      4.   In order to maintain accounting alignment with each fiscal year, at
the end of the August retail customer billing period each year, but prior to
the September SCA analysis and calculations, any credits that have been accrued
by the "bank" will be zeroed out. Any remaining recoverable debits, which
represent actual costs incurred, will be carried forward and be subject to the
same recovery process as detailed throughout this section.
      5.   The total recoverable amount during a single fiscal year will not
exceed two percent (2%) of the Power Department's total budgeted revenue,

15.20.250: ELECTRIC SERVICE SCHEDULE 35; NET METERING PILOT PROGRAM:
   A.   Applicability: The net metering pilot program is available to customers
located within the City's current electrical service territory who:
      1.   Purchase electricity from the City under the provisions of another
electric service schedule; and
      2.   Own and operate a solar, wind, or hydroelectric generator located on
the customer's premises that:
         a.   Is primarily intended to offset part or all of the customer's own
electrical requirements on the premises;
         b.   Has a capacity of no more than ten kilowatts (10 kW);
         c.   Is interconnected with Murray City's electric system; and
         d.   Operates in parallel with the City's distribution system.
   B.   Definitions: As used in this section:
NET ENERGY: The difference between the electricity supplied by the City to the
customer through the City's electric distribution system and the electricity
generated on the customer's premises which is fed back into the City's electric
distribution system.
NET METERING: A method of measuring the difference between the electricity
supplied by the City to the customer through the City's electric distribution
system and the electricity generated on the customer's premises which is fed
back into the City's electric distribution system.
   C.   Special Conditions:
      1.   The customer shall pay for the net energy used in accordance with
the following formula:
         a.   The customer shall pay for all electric energy supplied by the
City to the customer in any billing period in excess of the amount of electric
energy produced by the customer on the premises which is fed back into the
City's electric distribution system during that same billing period.
         b.   The customer shall receive a credit for all electric energy
produced by the customer on the premises which is fed back into the City's
electric distribution system during a billing period in excess of the amount of
electric energy supplied by the City during that billing period, with such
credit applied to the customer's future bills, except that any electric energy
credit balance remaining in favor of the customer under the provisions of this
subsection C1b at the time of their April billing each year shall be zeroed out
with no further liability to the City and no credit to the customer for said
balance.
         c.   In the event the customer terminates service under this electric
service schedule, any electric energy credit balance in favor of the customer
under the provisions of subsection C1b of this section shall be forfeited. The
City will not make cash payments to customers based on their participation in
the net metering pilot program for energy produced by the customer which is fed
into the City's electric distribution system.
      2.   The price for electric energy provided to or credited to a customer
participating in the net metering pilot program shall be the price charged by
the City under the provisions of the electric service schedule for which the
customer receives service absent this electric service schedule 35.
      3.   The net metering pilot program billing adjustment only applies to
charges for energy. Participating customers are subject to all other charges,
rates, terms and conditions of the electric service schedule under which the
customer receives service except as expressly altered by this electric service
schedule 35.
      4.   The customer shall provide, at the customer's own expense, all
equipment necessary to meet applicable safety, power quality, and
interconnection requirements established by the National Electrical Code (NEC),
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Underwriters
Laboratories (UL), and any applicable local and State agencies, including any
equipment deemed necessary by the City's Power Department expressly to
accommodate the customer's request to qualify for this electric service
schedule 35. The customer must first obtain written approval from the City's
Power Department before the customer's on site generating system is energized
or interconnected with the City's electric system.
      5.   In order to participate in the City's net metering pilot program and
to receive the benefits of this electric service schedule 35, the customer must
first sign a net metering pilot program interconnection and service agreement
with the City. The interconnection and service agreement allows the customer to
interconnect and operate in parallel with the City's distribution system and
allows the City to test and inspect the customer's system periodically to
ensure the safety of electrical workers and integrity of the City's electric
distribution system. The interconnection and service agreement will contain
additional terms and conditions for service under this electric service
schedule 35, including specific terms of interconnection and parallel operation
with the City's electrical system.
      6.   The net metering pilot program and this electric service schedule 35
are presently made available to customers on a trial basis. This electric
service schedule 35 and the net metering pilot program may be adjusted or
discontinued by the Murray City Municipal Council for any reason, at any time
without any obligation to existing participants.

from the customer shall be adjusted in accordance with electric service
schedule 30. (Ord. 16-17)
15.20.260: POWER FUND FINANCIAL STANDARDS:
In order to maintain fiscal soundness of the Power Fund, the following
financial standards are established:
   A.   Operational Transfers: There shall be, each fiscal year, an operational
transfer from the City's Power Enterprise Fund to the City's General Fund of
eight percent (8.00%) of total operating revenues (including wholesale power
sales revenue), as used and defined in the Utah Uniform Fiscal Procedure Act,
excluding:
      1.   Disbursements and/or refunds of overcollections and/or margins
received from Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) and/or the
Intermountain Power Agency (IPA); and
      2.   Revenues collected in accordance with electric service schedule 30,
supply cost adjustment (SCA): The in lieu of tax transfer approximates the
equivalent ad valorem taxes which would be imposed on an investor owned utility
with the same or similar facilities. This transfer does not prohibit the Power
Department from assisting or providing other services to other City
departments.
   B.   Transfer For Administrative Services: Transfer for administrative
services to the General Fund must be in an amount not to exceed the value of
the actual services rendered. Such amount will be set each year by the Director
of Finance and Administration and approved by the City Council through the
budget approval process, based upon established cost allocation methodologies.
In the general audit for fiscal year 1994-1995, and every fifth year
thereafter, an allocation audit will be included in the general audit performed
for the City by an independent auditor, to verify and/or recommend modification
of the cost allocation methodologies. Any additional costs must be paid out of
an appropriate Power Department account.
   C.   Investments, Cash And Cash Equivalents Reserves (Reserve): The reserve
level for the Power Enterprise Fund (the "fund") is twenty five percent (25%)
of operating revenue ("reserve level"). This reserve level is to provide cash
liquidity and operational stability in case of situations such as natural
disasters, equipment failure, economic uncertainty, and weather variations. As
a result of onetime expenses, the reserve level may fluctuate, provided however
that the reserve level should not be drawn upon for ongoing operational
expenses. If reserves are drawn below the reserve level, the fund will
replenish reserves to the reserve level within five (5) years. (Ord. 19-05:

   C.   The city needs to ensure the quality control of work. Therefore, all
line extensions and facilities modifications will be made by the power
department, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the city. Wherever the
city authorizes a developer or customer to install line extensions and
facilities modifications, developer or customer shall pay the city the actual
costs incurred by the city to facilitate such line extensions and facilities
modifications. All line extensions and facilities modifications will be made in
accordance with standard construction requirements approved by the power
department.
   D.   A customer or developer will be required to sign an agreement and pay

refund the difference to the customer or developer. In the event that actual
charges exceed the estimated fees, the customer or developer will be required
to pay the additional charges to the city.
   E.   Except as provided in sections
15.22.080 and
15.22.110 of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter do not apply to
system improvements. Impact fees for system improvements shall be governed by a
power impact fee ordinance, as adopted by the Murray City council. (Ord. 03-07
§ 2)
15.22.110: POWER IMPACT FEES:
   A.   The entire area connected to the City's municipal power system within
the geographical boundaries of Murray City is designated as a single unified
service area for purposes of the calculation and imposition of the power impact
fees.
   B.   The power department general manager may review and, subject to
approval by the Murray City Council, authorize an adjustment in the power
impact fee at the time the fee is charged to:
      1.   Respond to unusual circumstances in specific cases;
      2.   Respond to a request for a prompt and individualized impact fee
review for the development activity of the state, a school district, or a
charter school and an offset or credit for a public facility for which an
impact fee has been or will be collected; and
      3.   Ensure that power impact fees are imposed fairly.
   C.   The power department general manager's review under subsection B of
this section of the calculation and the adjustment, if any, in the amount of a
power impact fee, may be based, in whole or in part, on studies and data
submitted by the developer.
   D.   A developer, including a school district or a charter school, may
receive a credit against or a proportionate reimbursement of an impact fee if
the developer:
      1.   Dedicates land for a system improvement;
      2.   Builds and dedicates some or all of a system improvement; or
      3.   Dedicates a public facility that the City and the developer agree
will reduce the need for a system improvement.
   E.   There shall be a credit against impact fees for any dedication of land
for, improvement to, or new construction of, any system improvements provided
by the developer if the facilities:
      1.   Are system improvements; or
      2.   a. Are dedicated to the public; and
         b.   Offset the need for an identified system improvement.
   F.   For purposes of this section, new development shall include remodeling,
building enlargement, or any other construction or improvement which will place
an increased burden on the City's power system.
   G.   Power impact fees are computed as capacity based fees derived from unit
costs for facility capacity, without assuming the location or type of
development to be served. Using this approach, power impact fees are calculated
in terms of cost per unit of capacity, rather than cost per unit of
development, which fees shall be imposed on all developments made on or after
the effective date hereof, as follows:
 
Connection Type Connection Size Load (kW) Power Impact Fee ($/kW) $118.47

16.04.110: Modifications; Permitted When; Petition From Subdivider
16.04.120: Penalties
16.04.010: PURPOSES:
   A.   The purposes of this title are:
      1.   To promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents
of the City;
      2.   To ensure the efficient and orderly development of land within the
City;
      3.   To prevent the uncontrolled division and development of real
property, which may be done without considering the rights and best interests
of adjoining property owners and the City as a whole;
      4.   To avoid poorly planned developments that:
         a.   Do not comply with the City general plan or ordinances,
         b.   Cannot be adequately served by existing utilities or public
services,
         c.   May prove to be dangerous or unsafe,
         d.   May cause an undue burden on existing traffic or transportation
services, or
         e.   May require the future expenditure of public funds to correct
problems caused by the development;

each parcel of real property has unique site/situation characteristics, there
may be some aspects of subdivision development that cannot easily be
articulated. For this reason, it is not possible to cover every possible
contingency. Therefore, the City Engineer, Planning Commission, and Community
and Economic Development Director have the authority to impose reasonable
conditions upon a subdivider in addition to those expressly required, provided
that:

linen or Mylar to the outside, or trim line dimensions of twenty two by thirty
four inches (22 x 34") and the borderline of the plat shall be drawn in heavy
lines leaving a space of at least one and one-half inches (11/2") on the left
hand margin of the sheet for binding, and not less than a one-half inch (1/2")
margin, in from the outside or trim line, around the other three (3) edges of
the sheet. The plat shall be so drawn that the top of the sheet either faces
north or west, whichever accommodates the drawing best. All lines, dimension
and markings shall be made on the tracing linen with approved ink;
      2.   The actual plat drawing shall be made on a scale large enough to
clearly show all details, and the workmanship on the finished drawing shall be
neat, clear cut and readable. The subdivider must also furnish, in addition to
the original plat or drawing, an approved and acceptable reproduction of the
original plat or drawing made on tracing linen, and to the same dimension and
size as the original, or shall furnish two (2) original tracings, as above
provided, whichever is preferred;
      3.   The printing or reproduction process used shall not incur any
shrinkage or distortions, and the reproduced tracing furnished shall be of good
quality, to true dimension, clear and readable, and in all respects comparable
to the original plat or drawing so that the lines, dimensions and markings will
not rub off or smear. Both of the tracings, whether originals or one original
and a reproduction, shall be signed separately by all required and authorized
parties, and the final drawings or plats shall contain the information set
forth in this chapter. The location of the subdivision within the City shall be
shown by a small scale map on the first sheet.
   B.   The title of each sheet of such final plat shall consist of the
approved name and unit number of the subdivision (if any) at the lower right
hand corner of the sheet, followed by the words "Murray City".
   C.   Wherever the City Engineer has established a system of coordinates, the

purpose shall be delineated and designated with all dimensions, boundaries and
courses clearly shown and defined in every case. Parcels offered for dedication
other than for streets or easements shall be designated by letter. Sufficient
linear, angular and curve data shall be shown to determine readily the bearing
and length of the boundary lines of every block, lot and parcel which is a part
thereof. Sheets shall be so arranged that no lot is split between two (2) or
more sheets and, whenever practicable, blocks in their entirety shall be shown
on one sheet. No ditto marks shall be used for lot dimensions. Lot numbers
shall begin with the numeral "1" and continue consecutively throughout the
subdivision with no omissions or duplications.
   G.   The map shall show the right-of-way lines of each street and the width
of any portion being dedicated, and widths of any existing dedications. The
widths and locations of adjacent streets and other public properties within one
hundred feet (100') of the subdivision shall be shown. If any street in the
subdivision is a continuation or an approximate continuation of an existing
street, the conformity or the amount of nonconformity of such street to such
existing streets shall be accurately shown. Whenever the centerline of a street
has been established or recorded, the date shall be shown on the final map.
   H.   The plat shall indicate buildable areas and square footage for each
lot. The side lines of all easements shall be shown by fine dashed lines. The
widths of all easements and sufficient ties thereto to definitely locate the
same with respect to the subdivision shall be shown. All easements shall be
clearly labeled and identified. All lots must have a ten foot (10') rear yard
utility easement, a ten foot (10') front yard utility easement. All lots must
have side yard utility and drainage easements as follows: In the R-1-6 Zone,
lots must have a five foot (5') utility and drainage easement in one side yard.

location of any 100-year floodplain as designated by the Army Corps of
Engineers or other Federal authority.
   J.   The plat shall show fully and clearly stakes, monuments and other
evidence indicating the boundaries of the subdivision as found on the site. Any
monument or bench mark that is disturbed or destroyed before acceptance of all
improvements shall be replaced by the subdivider under the direction of the
City Engineer. The following required monuments shall be shown on the final
plat:
      1.   The location of all monuments placed in marking the survey,
including a statement as to what, if any, points were reset by ties;
      2.   All rear lot corner pipes and front lot corner pipes or offset cross
marks in the concrete surface of the public sidewalk.

1: prior code § 30-29)
16.16.020: UNDERGROUND UTILITY INSTALLATION:
All underground utilities, sanitary sewers and storm drains installed in
streets or alleys shall be constructed prior to the surfacing of such streets
or alleys. Connections for all underground utilities and sanitary sewers shall
be laid to such length as will obviate the necessity for disturbing the street
or alley improvements when service connections thereto are made. (Ord. 94-40 §
1: prior code § 30-30)
16.16.030: IMPROVEMENTS; AS BUILT PLAN FILED ON COMPLETION:
A complete improvement plan ("as built") shall be filed with the city engineer
upon completion of said improvements. Such as built plans shall be drawn on
copies of the original tracings and certified as to accuracy and completeness
by the subdivider's licensed contractor. Upon receipt and acceptance of the as
built plan, the city engineer will recommend formal acceptance by the mayor.
(Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior code § 30-31)
16.16.040: FLOODPLAIN REQUIREMENTS:
If the subdivision is located in an "area of special flood hazard", as defined
in chapter 17.20 of this code, or its successor chapter, the subdivision design
and plat must comply with all provisions of that chapter. (Ord. 94-40 § 1:
prior code § 30-32)
16.16.050: GENERAL REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS:
Subdivision of land in the city shall comply with the requirements of this
chapter, title 17 of this code, and other applicable ordinances. (Ord. 94-40 §
1: prior code § 30-33)

All site development and subdivision work performed under this chapter will be
allowed only if the work is performed under the supervision of the city
engineer or public works director according to an approved subdivision plan,
and the work is secured by a performance guarantee bond. (Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior
code § 30-34)
16.16.070: HAZARDOUS AREAS TO BE FENCED:
All areas of the subdivision or features adjacent to the subdivision, which
present a potential threat to the public safety, shall be fenced with a six
foot (6') nonclimbable fence or masonry wall as required by the planning
commission. Such hazardous areas may include, but are not limited to, rivers
and streams, canals, cliffs, ravines, arterial or collector streets, railroad
rights of way, and steep slopes. The fence or wall shall be constructed and
included as part of the subdivision improvements and shall be bonded. (Ord. 94-
40 § 1: prior code § 30-35)
16.16.080: BUILDABLE LOTS:
All subdivisions shall result in the creation of lots which comply with
applicable regulations established in the zoning ordinance. A subdivision may
not create lots which would make improvements and services impractical due to
size, shape, steepness of terrain, location of watercourses, problems of
sewerage or driveway grades, or other physical conditions. (Ord. 94-40 § 1:
prior code § 30-36)
16.16.090: ACCESS TO PUBLIC STREETS:
   A.   All lots or parcels created by the subdivision of land, for single-
family or two-family dwellings, including, without limiting, subdivisions,
residential infill developments, and planned unit developments, shall abut a

chapter.
   B.   As part of the preliminary plat review for application of any
subdivision including private streets, the subdivider shall submit for review
by the city engineer the following street plans:
      1.   A private street development plan showing:
         a.   The alignment, width, grades, design, and material
specifications,
         b.   Drainage,
         c.   Utility easements for servicing the lots served by the private
street;
      2.   A plan providing for future ownership and maintenance of the private
street together with payment of taxes and other liability thereon.
After review and favorable recommendation by the city engineer, the planning
commission may include such approved street plans as part of its
recommendations to the mayor. (Ord. 07-42 § 2: Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior code § 30-
37)
16.16.100: UTILITIES AND EASEMENTS:
   A.   All utilities shall be provided through underground service within the
subdivision.
   B.   Easements for utility services and drainage purposes shall be provided
within the subdivision as required by the city engineer and the power
department general manager. (Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior code § 30-38)
16.16.110: WATERCOURSES:
   A.   The subdivider shall dedicate a right of way for storm drainage
conforming substantially with the lines of any natural watercourse or channel,
stream, creek or floodplain that enters or traverses the subdivision.
   B.   Replacement and new bridges, culverts or piping of the natural
tributaries and open manmade channels, except irrigation canals, shall be
designed as approved by the city engineer. (Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior code § 30-39)
16.16.120: BLOCK DESIGN:
   A.   Width: Generally blocks must have sufficient width for an ultimate
layout of two (2) tiers of lots of the size required by the provisions of title
17 of this code. (Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior code § 30-40)
16.16.130: PARKS, SCHOOLS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES:
   A.   In subdividing property, consideration shall be given to suitable sites
for schools, parks, playgrounds and other areas for public use. Any provision
for such open spaces shall be indicated on the preliminary plat in order that
it may be determined when and in what manner such areas will be dedicated to or
acquired by the appropriate agency. If any such proposed public areas have not
been purchased at a fair price by the appropriate public agency or have not
been freely dedicated to the public by the subdivider within one year after the
recording of the final plat, the areas may be divided into lots and sold by the
subdivider in accordance with lot requirements of this chapter. When any such
public space is shown on the preliminary plat, a copy of such plat shall be
made available to the appropriate public agency for its consideration within a
reasonable time after receipt of copies of the plat by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 94-40 § 1: Prior Code § 30-41)
16.16.140: LOT DESIGN STANDARDS:
The lot design shall contain the following principles and standards:
   A.   Minimum Area; Size: The minimum area, width and dimensions of all lots
shall conform to the requirements of title 17 of this Code for the district in
which the subdivision is located. In calculating the lot area for purposes of
this chapter and for purposes of title 17, chapter 17.60 of this Code, the
square footage of any street, whether public or private, shall not be included.
   B.   Side Lot Lines: The side lines of all lots, so far as possible, shall
be designed to be at right angles to the street which the lot faces, or
approximately radial to the center of curvatures, if such street is curved.
Side lines of cul-de-sac lots shall be designed to be approximately radial to
the center of curvature of the turnaround.
   C.   Corner Lots: Corner lots have more than one side which must maintain
required front yard setbacks, and therefore shall be platted wider than
interior lots in order to permit conformance with the required street setback
requirements of title 17 of this Code.
   D.   Flag Lots: Flag lots are not permitted unless the Planning Commission
finds that due to unusual lot shape, location, or other unusual conditions,
direct lot frontage on a street is precluded, and recommends waiver of the
minimum width requirement on an individual lot basis as a conditional use under
title 17 of this Code. The access strip may not be less than twenty feet (20')
in width. In calculating the lot area of a flag lot, the square footage
included in the access strip may not be included in the computation.
   E.   Developable Area Limitation: The Planning Commission may recommend that
certain areas in a proposed subdivision may be built upon, fenced, or more
extensively landscaped. The Planning Commission may recommend all undevelopable
portions of proposed lots be identified by shading and notation upon the final
plat, and that limitation shall also be made a part of the subdivision
restrictive covenants. This provision may be invoked to protect, among other
things, natural slopes or vegetation, special natural topographic features,
faults, or visual factors.
   F.   Double Frontage Lots: Lots, other than corner lots, having double
frontage may not be approved except where necessitated by topographic,
transportation corridor requirements, or other unusual conditions. Double
frontage lot improvements shall include the masonry wall and related landscape
improvements as follows:
      1.   A solid masonry buffer wall is required on the rear lot line of
double frontage lots which abut collector and arterial streets.
      2.   Regulation sidewalk and approved park strip are required adjacent to
the rear lot line buffer wall of double frontage lots.
      3.   A subdivision plat may not receive final approval for recording
unless the design plan for the buffer wall and related sidewalk/park strip
improvements required by this section have been approved by the Public Works
Department and the Community and Economic Development Division and installation
of the improvements is guaranteed as provided by law.
      4.   The masonry buffer wall and related sidewalk and park strip
improvements shall be approved according to the following criteria:
         a.   The buffer wall shall comply with title 17 of this Code.
         b.   The buffer wall shall be constructed of brick, concrete block or
similar masonry materials as approved by the Community Development Department.
         c.   Unpaved areas between the inside edge of the sidewalk and the
buffer wall are not permitted; any of these gaps shall be covered by widening
the sidewalk.
         d.   The subdivider/developer shall, as part of the development,
install concrete around the park strip, along with sleeves underneath or
through the sidewalk to accommodate sprinkling systems to the park strip and
shall include a program for watering and care to assure the survival and growth
of the landscaping that meets the approval of the Planning Commission.
         e.   Trees shall be provided on thirty foot (30') centers in the park
strip. On corner lots, the first tree nearest the intersection shall be located
forty feet (40') from the intersection. Trees to be planted shall be provided
by the subdivider/developer as provided in section
16.16.280 of this chapter.
         f.   The park strip area abutting the collector or arterial street
shall be landscaped with vegetation, as approved by the Community and Economic
Development Division, except as otherwise provided in subsection F4j of this
section.
         g.   The subdivider/developer shall warranty that all required
landscaping shall survive the initial planting season and shall be in a hardy
living condition, as determined by the City Forester, within one year of the
initial planting season.
         h.   A property owners' association or the adjacent property owner
shall maintain the landscaping required for the park strip, unless the City
agrees to maintain the landscaping. The City, at its discretion, may add,
remove, replace, or maintain landscaping within the park strip.
The applicant may request City maintenance. The following standards apply:
            (1)   Acceptance of maintenance shall be based on the determination
that the public interest is served by City maintenance. The City may require an
additional assessment on the subject properties for ongoing maintenance.
            (2)   Installation of all landscaping improvements shall be per
City standards.
            (3)   Installation of all landscaping and improvements shall be
part of the public improvements.
The applicant shall maintain the improvements for at least one year following
construction acceptance by the City, thereafter until the City has granted
final acceptance for maintenance.
         i.   It shall be unlawful for any person to remove turf, trees or
forms of landscaping from a park strip which were required by the provisions of
this section unless first approved by the Community and Economic Development
Division. This provision does not apply to routine maintenance of a park strip.
         j.   Due to high traffic volumes and limited access by property
owners, the required vegetation in park strips adjacent to double frontage lots
abutting 1300 East, 900 East, the Van Winkle Expressway, State Street, 700
West, 4500 South, Winchester Street and 5300 South west of State Street may be
substituted with brick pavers or finished concrete.
      5.   The Community and Economic Development Division may approve minor
modifications to the requirements of this section to better achieve the intent
and address specific site conditions. Upon request by an applicant, the
Planning Commission may approve an alternative landscape plan that may be
substituted in whole or in part for the landscaping meeting the standards of
this section. To approve an alternative landscape plan, the Planning Commission
must first find that the proposed alternative plan accomplishes the purposes of
this section equally well or better than would a plan which complies with the
standard of this section.
      6.   "Double frontage lots" as used in this section means a subdivision
lot which has access from an interior subdivision street and also abuts the
right-of-way of a collector or arterial street along the rear lot line. This
section does not apply to subdivision lots created by plats which received
preliminary approval from the Planning Commission prior to the effective date
hereof. (Ord. 18-06: Ord. 16-19: Ord. 06-42 § 2: Ord. 06-14 § 3: Ord. 02-32 §
2: Ord. 94-40 § 1: Prior Code § 30-42)
16.16.150: GRADING AND DUST CONTROL STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS:
All subdivisions and improvement work shall be accomplished in conformance to
the following grading and dust control regulations:
   A.   Grading: All lots must be rough graded in accordance with an approved
grading plan and chapter 70 of the Uniform Building Code.
   B.   Dust And Street Mud Tracking Control:
      1.   All graded surfaces of any nature shall be dampened or suitably
contained to prevent dust or spillage on City streets or drifting onto adjacent
properties. Equipment, materials and roadways on the site shall be used or
treated so as to cause the least possible annoyance due to dirt, mud, or dust
conditions. The City Engineer may require the installation of silt screening or
similar means such as straw bales, to prevent excess silt contamination in
watercourses, storm drains or similar facilities;
      2.   Mud and soil may not be tracked onto public streets during
construction of subdivision improvements or during construction of a structure
on a subdivision lot;
      3.   The contractor, subcontractor, developer, owner, and any other
person responsible for the construction on the lot are jointly and severally
required to abate dust conditions and clean or sweep the affected public street
to the satisfaction of the Public Works Department of the City;
      4.   If, after written notice, dust is not properly abated or if soil and
mud are not cleaned or swept from the affected public street, the City may
abate the dust condition or clean or sweep the affected public street and
recover the cost of doing so, together with an administrative overhead, from
the owner of the property from which the violation of this section arose, in
accordance with the procedure set forth in title 10, chapter 11 of the Utah
Code Annotated relating to cleaning of real property;
      5.   In addition to abatement or enforcement remedies available in this
chapter or other law, the City Public Works Department may refuse to inspect or
otherwise approve any work or construction on any subdivision street,
improvement, or subdivision lot which is the source or location of a violation
of this section and which violation has not been corrected or abated. (Ord. 94-
40 § 1: Prior Code § 30-43)
16.16.160: STREET DESIGN STANDARDS:
The following minimum standards and design criteria shall apply unless deemed
unwarranted by written recommendation of the City Engineer. These standards and
criteria shall be supplemented by other applicable existing engineering and
construction requirements and standards as specified by the City Engineer.
   A.   Subdivision Design: The subdivision design shall conform to the pattern
of major streets as designated in the City General Plan and the Transportation
Master Plan, or other official street plan adopted by the City.
   B.   Access Design: The street and traffic access design of a proposed
subdivision development shall promote the purposes and goals of the City's
Master transportation plan. Any street design proposal which would effectively
preclude or substantially impair the ability of the city to implement any
listed possible solution to a listed traffic problem, as described in the
transportation master plan, must be approved by the mayor after receiving the
recommendations of the city engineer and the planning commission.
   C.   Street Pattern: The street pattern in the subdivision shall be in
general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of
adjoining areas and the entire neighborhood or district. The following
guidelines shall be considered in evaluating a proposed street layout:
      1.   Proposed streets should be continuous and in alignment with existing
planned or platted streets;
      2.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the land
to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions,
or unless, in the opinion of the city engineer, the road extension is not
desirable for the coordination of the subdivision with the existing layout or
the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts;
      3.   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit;
      4.   Alleys shall not normally be permitted in residential subdivisions,
but may be permitted in nonresidential subdivisions.
   D.   Subdivisions Adjacent To Arterials: Subdivisions adjacent to arterials
should be designed according to the following guidelines:
      1.   Street design shall have the purpose of making adjacent lots, if for
residential use, desirable for such use by mitigating the impact of heavy
traffic and of minimizing the interference with traffic on arterials;
      2.   The number of intersecting streets along arterials shall be held to
a minimum;
      3.   Frontage roads, if required or existing, shall be separated from the
arterial or freeway by a strip of permanent landscaping not less than ten feet
(10') in width. A landscaping plan for the strip shall be submitted for
approval by the city forester. Frontage roads shall enter arterials by means of
intersections designed with turning and stacking capacity adequate for the
traffic volume as estimated by the city engineer;
      4.   Where frontage roads are not required, residential lots adjacent to
an arterial shall be served by a minor residential street paralleling said
arterial at a generous lot depth therefrom. The minor residential street shall
be separated from the arterial by a strip of permanent landscaping parallel to
the arterial right of way not less than ten feet (10') in width. Greater widths
may be appropriate and required by the city engineer;
      5.   If the rear of any lot borders a public street, the subdivider may
be required to execute and deliver to the city an instrument, deemed sufficient
by the city attorney, prohibiting the right of ingress and egress from said
public street to that lot. In addition, a masonry wall and related improvements
must be installed as provided in this chapter.
   E.   Grades: Curves and sight distances shall be subject to approval by the
city engineer to ensure proper drainage and safety for vehicles and
pedestrians. Grades of all streets shall conform in general to the terrain, and
may not be less than one- half percent (1/2%) nor more than five percent (5%)
for main thoroughfares nor more than ten percent (10%) for minor streets.
   F.   Curb Radii: Curb radii at intersections shall comply with
specifications as directed by the city engineer. (Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior code §
30-44)
16.16.170: RELATION OF NEW STREETS TO ADJOINING STREET SYSTEM; ACCESS STREETS:
   A.   Continuation Of Existing Streets: The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions should provide for the continuation of the existing streets from
adjoining areas and should provide access to unsubdivided adjoining areas. The
subdivider may be required to submit a plat providing streets which will
continue into adjacent undeveloped property and which describes a proposed
entire street alignment which will provide the access to collector or other
major streets as required in this chapter or to implement the city's
transportation master plan.
   B.   Maximum Dwelling Units On Single Access Street: Residential
subdivisions must have adequate access to and from streets.
      1.   Single- And Two-Family Dwellings: Any residential subdivision
development of more than thirty (30) single- or two-family dwellings shall have
access to and from at least two (2) existing or proposed streets.
      2.   Multiple-Family Dwellings: Any residential subdivision development
of more than one hundred (100) multiple-family dwellings shall have access to
and from at least two (2) existing or proposed streets.
      3.   Engineering Consultant; Study: In the event a subdivision proposal
for new lots to be served by a new or an existing single access street system
where the total number of dwelling units existing, plus those proposed by the
applicant, is likely to exceed the maximum dwelling units allowed, as set forth
in subsections B1 and B2 of this section, the applicant shall retain a
professional engineering consultant, acceptable to the city, to conduct a
thorough study relative to the local street system and inherent safety
concerns. The city engineer may render an opinion on the consultant's study and
a recommendation to the planning commission. Additionally, if the city engineer
deems an additional study necessary after reviewing the consultant's study, the
city engineer may conduct a study and render an opinion; with all costs to be
paid by the applicant. Upon the planning commission's finding that a study is
acceptable the applicant shall further demonstrate to the planning commission
that the existing street system and fire suppression availability, together
with any proposed improvements, is conducive to efficient travel, public
safety, and the protection of property and the community residents therein.
      4.   Greater Access Requirements: Access requirements should not be
construed to limit the city's authority to impose greater access requirements
for residential areas if, in the opinion of the city engineer or the city fire
marshal, the extent of existing and predicted residential development in a
given area requires additional street access.
   C.   Design Standards: Every development proposal shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the city engineer, city fire marshal and planning commission
that the overall street system design and subdivision layout incorporates
design features conducive to efficient travel, public safety, and the
protection of property and the community residents therein. The basis for the
required improvements shall be in accordance with the street design and fire
suppression standards adopted by the city. Required improvements shall bear a
proportionate, rational nexus to the impact of the proposed development on the
local roadway system.
   D.   Findings: The planning commission may make findings, based upon the
recommendations from the city engineer, city fire marshal, other staff members,
expert opinion, the applicant and public comment. Findings should include, at a
minimum, that the access street(s) and the proposed connection(s) to other
streets will safely and adequately accommodate the vehicle trips and turning
movements which may reasonably be expected to be generated by the proposed
development; and that the proposed access will adequately accommodate the
delivery of municipal services. (Ord. 07-42 § 2: Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior code §
30-45)
16.16.180: STREETS, ALLEYS, CUL-DE-SACS AND EASEMENTS:
   A.   Streets: Streets shall conform to the width designated on the
transportation master plan and as designated by the standards adopted by the
city engineering division. The subdivider may be required either to provide
land for widening of established streets within or adjacent to a proposed
subdivision or to provide land for new streets necessitated by the development.
      1.   All streets must have a minimum width of forty nine feet (49') with
an asphalted width of twenty five feet (25').
   B.   Permanent Cul-De-Sac Streets And Turnaround Requirements: The
turnaround at the end of a dead end street designed and approved to be
permanently closed to through traffic must meet the following requirements:
      1.   No cul-de-sac street may exceed one thousand feet (1,000') in
length;
      2.   The turnaround at the end of the street must have a right of way
radius of fifty feet (50') measured from the center of the turnaround to the
property line;
      3.   The length of a cul-de-sac street is measured from the center of the
turnaround to the opening of the street, as determined by the city engineer;
      4.   An existing street which is retrofitted to become a cul-de-sac
street must meet the requirements of this section.
   C.   Temporary Cul-De-Sac: If a subdivision street is intended to continue
into adjacent property to comply with the requirements of subsection A of this
section, a stub street with a temporary cul-de-sac may be established under the
following conditions:
      1.   If no residential lots use the temporary cul-de-sac street for
access, the street may be of any length and need not have a turnaround at its
end;
      2.   If the stub street is in excess of one hundred feet (100') in
length, one lot at the end of the street must be temporarily used for the
construction of a turnaround as approved by the city engineer and the fire
chief. Curbs, gutters and sidewalks are required to be installed. It shall be
the responsibility of the developer who constructs the continuation of the
street to install curb, gutter and sidewalks for the lot used for the
turnaround. The stub street shall not be included in any subdivision plat
without the express written approval of the city engineer and the planning and
zoning commission;
      3.   If the stub street is less than one hundred feet (100') in length,
no temporary cul-de-sac is required. (Ord. 07-42 § 2: Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior
code § 30-46)
16.16.190: CURB, GUTTER, PARK STRIP AND SIDEWALK:
The following principles and standards shall apply to the design and
installation of curbs, gutters, sidewalks, park strips and pedestrianways:
   A.   Curb and gutter as shown on the city's standard detail drawings is
required in all subdivisions. Curb and gutter shall be a minimum of 2.5 feet
wide and shall be installed on both sides of the paved width portion of street
right of way. The planning commission may recommend that sidewalks be omitted
in a subdivision, or planned unit development having an internal pedestrian
system, if the planning commission finds that the public safety is not
substantially jeopardized.
   B.   A park strip is required in all subdivisions, except as otherwise
recommended by the planning commission and the city engineer. The park strip
shall be located either within the nonpaved portion of the street right of way,
or within a dedicated landscaping easement, not less than five and one-half
feet (51/2') wide, adjacent to the street. The park strip generally is
contiguous with the back of the curb and gutter, but may be located at the back
of sidewalk in a landscape easement if the sidewalk is placed at the back of
the curb and gutter.
   C.   Sidewalks are generally located contiguous to the edge of the planting
strip and are four feet (4') wide. For good cause shown, the sidewalk may be
installed at the back of the curb and gutter with a width and in a
configuration as required by the city engineer. (Ord. 14-06: Ord. 07-42 § 2:
Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior code § 30-47)
16.16.200: PROTECTION STRIP NOT ALLOWED:
   A.   Protection Strip: If a new subdivision street is contiguous to
undeveloped property, the subdivider may not retain a protection strip between
the street and the adjacent undeveloped property. (Ord. 07-42 § 2: Ord. 94-40 §
1: prior code § 30-48)
16.16.210: PROCEDURE FOR CLOSURE OF ROADWAYS:
In addition to the requirements set forth in section 10-8-8.1 et seq., Utah
Code Annotated, as amended, the following procedures shall be followed for the
closure of any road:
   A.   Petition; Filing: Petition for road closure shall be filed with the
planning and zoning commission who shall submit the same to the traffic
committee for its recommendation regarding the proposed closure. Upon receipt
of the recommendation, the planning and zoning commission shall consider
whether or not the road should be closed.
   B.   Closure: If the decision of the planning and zoning commission is to
recommend closure, such decision shall be forwarded to the city council for
their consideration pursuant to the terms of state law.
   C.   Open: If the decision of the planning and zoning commission is to have
the road remain open, the decision shall be final unless appealed by any
resident of the city to the city council. The appeal must be made in writing
and within fifteen (15) days from the date of the decision of the planning and
zoning commission.
   D.   Relevant Standards: The traffic committee, planning and zoning
commission and the city council, when considering the proposed closure of a
road, must base their decision upon, among other reasons, the following:
      1.   Traffic volume projected for the road both in an open and closed
configuration;
      2.   Compatibility of the adjacent properties and projected land uses;
      3.   It is the intent of the city to have streets interconnect with other
subdivisions and adjacent properties;
      4.   Effect of closure of road will not increase the response time of
public safety vehicles responding to emergencies. (Ord. 94-40 § 1: prior code §
30-49)
16.16.220: PERFORMANCE BOND:
   A.   Prior to recordation of a final plat, after it has received the mayor's
approval, the subdivider shall complete all of the public improvements required
in the subdivision. At the option of the city, prior to recordation, the
subdivider may enter into a performance bond agreement with the city to ensure
completion of all public improvements required to be installed in the
subdivision. The bond agreement shall be in a form and contain such provisions
as approved by the city attorney's office. The agreement shall include, but not
be limited to:
      1.   Incorporation by reference of the final plat and all data which is
used to compute the cost of the improvements by the public works department;
      2.   Completion of the improvements within one year after commencement of
construction. The city engineer, for cause shown, may extend the completion
date for one additional year;
      3.   The improvements shall be completed to the satisfaction of the
public works department and according to city standards, as established by the
public works department and accepted by the city;
      4.   The bond amount shall be equal to one hundred twenty five percent
(125%) of the public works department's estimated cost of the public
improvements to be installed;
      5.   The city shall have exclusive control over the bond proceeds and
they may be released only upon written approval of the city engineer;
      6.   The bond proceeds may be reduced upon request of the subdivider as
the improvements are installed. The amount of the reduction shall be determined
by the public works department. Such request may be made only once every thirty
(30) days and no reductions shall be authorized until such time as the public
works department has inspected the improvements and found them to be in
compliance with city standards;
      7.   If the bond proceeds are inadequate to pay the cost of the
completion of the improvements according to city standards for whatever reason,

CHAPTER 17.20
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION:
17.20.010: Findings
17.20.020: Purpose
17.20.030: Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses
17.20.040: Relationship Of Floodplain Hazard Regulations To City Zoning Map
17.20.050: Definitions
17.20.060: General Provisions
17.20.070: Administration
17.20.080: Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction
17.20.090: Variance Procedure
17.20.010: FINDINGS:
   A.   Flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to flood loss. (Ord. 09-26 § 2)
17.20.020: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of floodplain hazard regulations to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions to specific areas by provisions designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money for flood control projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   H.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards
assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 09-26 § 2)
17.20.030: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 09-26 § 2)
17.20.040: RELATIONSHIP OF FLOODPLAIN HAZARD REGULATIONS TO CITY ZONING MAP:
   A.   The floodplain hazard regulations of this chapter shall be supplemental
to, and not in lieu of, the applicable zoning provisions of the use district in
which the land is located. Property located within said floodplain hazard area
shall be developed only in conformance with the provisions set forth herein. In
cases of conflict between such district classifications and the floodplain
hazard regulations, the most restrictive provisions shall govern. Permitted and
conditional uses permitted in the "areas of special flood hazard" shall be
developed only in conformance with the provisions set forth herein. All uses
involving "development" as defined in section
17.20.050 of this chapter shall further meet the supplemental conditions and
standards set forth in this chapter.
   B.   Notice shall be given to all property owners whose property lies within
the designated floodplain by recordation of such restrictions with the Salt
Lake County recorder. (Ord. 09-26 § 2)
17.20.050: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application.
APPEAL: A request for a review of the city's interpretation of any provisions
of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain subject to a one
percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the
area of special flood hazard.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION: A
manufactured home park for which the construction of facilities for servicing
the lot on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads and the construction of streets) is completed before
the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or
pouring of concrete pads).
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the federal
emergency management agency has delineated both the areas of special flood
hazards and the risk premium zones.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the federal emergency
management agency that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary floodway
map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general or temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from: a) the overflow of inland or tidal
waters; and/or b) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface
waters from any source.
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1').
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. "Manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Structures for which the start of construction commenced on
or after the effective date hereof, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date hereof.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is: a) built on a single chassis; b) four
hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projections; c) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck; and d) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling
but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued; provided, the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty
(180) days of the permit date. The "actual start" means the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the "actual start of construction" means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building, or manufactured home that is
principally aboveground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. This term
does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a historic structure; provided, that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
(Ord. 09-26 § 2)
17.20.060: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city.
   B.   Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the federal emergency management agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study For The
City Of Murray, Utah", dated September 25, 2009, with an accompanying flood
insurance rate map (FIRM), as well as any letters of map amendments or
revisions which may hereafter be approved by the federal emergency management
agency, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
chapter. The flood insurance study (FIS) dated September 25, 2009, and FIRM are
on file in the office of the city engineer, 4646 South 500 West, Murray, Utah.
Future FISs and FIRMs will also be on file as they become effective.
   C.   Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms
of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   D.   Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easement, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions, shall prevail.
   E.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   F.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the federal emergency
management agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 09-26 §
2)

decide appeals and request for variances from the requirements of this chapter;
      2.   The board of appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the city in the enforcement or administration of this chapter;
      3.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals, or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decisions to any court of competent jurisdiction;
      4.   In passing upon such applications, the board of appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and:
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners;
         d.   The importance of the service provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with the existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         k.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges;
      5.   Upon consideration of the factors of this section and the purposes
of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter;
      6.   The city shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including
technical information, and report any variances to the federal emergency
management agency (FEMA).
   B.   Conditions For Variances:
      1.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base level, providing subsections A4a through A4k of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half (1/2) acre, the technical justifications required for issuing the variance
increases;
      2.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures which qualify for the National Register of Historic
Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or the city historic registry
without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section;
      3.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result;
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief;
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
      6.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

CHAPTER 17.24
HOME OCCUPATIONS
SECTION:
17.24.010: Purpose
17.24.020: Definitions
17.24.030: License Required
17.24.040: Major Home Occupations
17.24.050: Prohibited Uses
17.24.060: Application
17.24.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to allow and regulate certain income producing
accessory uses in residential districts which are compatible with, and not
detrimental to, the neighborhood in which they are located. Home occupations
are limited to those uses which may be conducted within a residential dwelling
without changing the appearance or condition of that residence. (Ord. 13-12)
17.24.020: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this chapter:
ABUTTING: Bordering or touching, such as sharing a common lot or property line.
ADJACENT: Sharing a common property line or separated by a road right of way,
drainage easement, or alley.
HOME OCCUPATION: A business, occupation, profession, operation, managing or
carrying on of a business for the purpose of economic gain, which activity is
carried on as an accessory use in a residential zone by a bona fide resident of
the dwelling. This definition shall not be construed to allow an employee,
working in the employee's own home in the service of an employer who does not
reside in the same dwelling. (Ord. 13-12)
17.24.030: LICENSE REQUIRED:
A home occupation license shall be required to conduct a permitted business in
a residence located in a residential zone. Home occupations are accessory uses
and are subject to the following regulations:
   A.   The home occupation business use must be conducted entirely within the
main dwelling, except that the outside yard areas may be used for group
instruction, residential daycare facilities and group education uses.
   B.   The home occupation business may be conducted only by persons who are
residents of the dwelling unit, except that up to one person not residing in
the residence may be engaged, volunteer or be employed by the licensee. The
owner of the business must reside in the residence. The planning commission may
approve more than one nonresident employee if it finds that the additional
employee will not be employed as a driver of a work vehicle kept at the
residence, and also finds that the employee's presence in the premises will not
otherwise violate the intent of this chapter. Only one nonresident employee, or
such additional nonresident employees as approved by the planning commission
through approval of a major home occupation, is allowed per residence,
regardless of the number of home occupation licenses held by persons residing
in the residence.
   C.   The business use must be clearly incidental and secondary to the
residential use of the dwelling and may not change the residential character of
the dwelling. No more than twenty five percent (25%) of the total main or upper
floor area, or, in the alternative, no more than fifty percent (50%) of the
total floor area of a basement, may be used to conduct a home occupation.
Interior alterations to accommodate a home occupation are prohibited if the
kitchen, the dining area, all bathrooms, the living room, or a majority of the
bedrooms is eliminated. Signs related to the home occupation are prohibited
unless otherwise provided in this title. Exterior alterations are prohibited if
the alterations change the residential appearance of the dwelling.
   D.   Commodities may be produced on the premises in accordance with law.
Sale of commodities from shelves or similar display on the premises is not
allowed.
   E.   Home occupation businesses shall not involve the use of any accessory
building or yard space for storage, sale, rental or display of supplies or
inventory used in the home occupation.
   F.   Group education, group instruction, childcare, and instruction of
children, other than those residing in the dwelling, are allowed as a home
occupation accessory use or as a conditional use only to the extent as allowed
in this title.
   G.   More than one home occupation business license per dwelling unit is
allowed; provided, however, that the cumulative effect of such businesses shall
not violate the provisions and the intent of this chapter. By way of
illustration and not limitation, the conduct of multiple home occupations may
not violate the prohibitions against excessive traffic, and the limit on the
number of nonresident employees and motor vehicles allowed at a residence. Any
or all of the home occupation licenses issued at a residence are subject to
suspension or revocation if the cumulative effect of the conduct of those
businesses violates this chapter.
   H.   Home occupation licensees shall comply with all state and local laws,
including fire, building, and similar life safety and health codes.
   I.   The premises of a home occupation may be inspected during reasonable
business hours to determine compliance with the provisions of this title.
   J.   A home occupation business license shall be valid for twelve (12)
months after it is issued and may be renewed annually unless the license, or
the privilege of renewing that license, has been revoked or suspended due to
violations of this title or other laws applicable to the home occupation
license. Home occupation business licenses, and major home occupation permits,
are personal to the applicant, nontransferable and do not run with the land.
   K.   One business vehicle used by the licensee in connection with the home
occupation may be parked at the premises, subject to the restrictions in this
chapter. Other motor vehicles and equipment, and trailers used to transport the
same, which are used in connection with the home occupation may not be stored
or parked on the premises of the licensee or in any street adjacent to the
licensed premises. Under no circumstances may motor vehicles having a gross
vehicle weight rating of more than twelve thousand (12,000) pounds and which
are used in connection with the home occupation be stored or parked on the
premises of a home occupation or any street adjacent to those premises. By way
of illustration and not limitation, this subsection is intended to prohibit the
storage or parking of business fleet vehicles, such as limousines; service or
work vehicles (snowplow/landscape maintenance trucks) and similar vehicles;
delivery vehicles; and contractor's equipment and trailers used to transport
the same. As provided in subsection B of this section, a nonresident employee
may not be allowed to drive any business vehicle parked at the premises as
permitted by this subsection as part of that employee's regular work
assignment.
   L.   The traffic generated by a home occupation may not exceed that which
would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood, and any need for
parking generated by the conduct of such home occupation shall be met off the
street according to city regulations. The home occupation shall not involve the
use of commercial vehicles having a gross vehicle weight rating of more than
twelve thousand (12,000) pounds for delivery of materials to or from the
premises.
   M.   Except as otherwise provided in this title, the community development
division and/or code enforcement is authorized to approve home occupation
applications in accordance with this title.
   N.   The home occupation may not be associated with noise, noxious odors,
fumes, glare, or other nuisances that may be discernible beyond the premises.
   O.   The storage or use of flammable, explosive, or other dangerous
materials is prohibited.
   P.   Uses where a client or customer comes to the home shall be subject to
the standards for a major home occupation permit. (Ord. 13-12)
17.24.040: MAJOR HOME OCCUPATIONS:
   A.   The following home occupations, which either require a client to come
to the home or which may result in neighborhood impacts if not properly
managed, may be authorized as an accessory use through a major home occupation
permit pursuant to the standards specified in this section:
Barbers, cosmetologists, manicurists.
Consultant services.
Contractor, "handyperson", and landscape or yard maintenance contractor;
subject to the special conditions that no construction materials or equipment
will be stored on the premises.
Counseling.
Home instruction including musical instruments, voice, dance, acting and
educational subjects, swimming, tennis and other athletic instruction.
Other similar personal or professional services where the client comes to the
home.
   B.   Uses classified as major home occupations must comply with the
standards of section
17.24.030 of this chapter, which shall be considered minimum standards. The
director or planning commission may require additional conditions to mitigate
impacts of the use on adjacent properties. These conditions may include, but
are not limited to:
      1.   Limits on hours of operation;
      2.   Limits on numbers of clients per day/hour;
      3.   Provision of adequate off street parking.
      4.   Other conditions related to mitigating adverse impacts resulting
from the use. (Ord. 13-12)
17.24.050: PROHIBITED USES:
The following uses by the nature of the investment or operation have a
pronounced tendency, once started, to rapidly increase beyond limits permitted
for home occupations and thereby impair the use and value of a residentially
zoned area for residence purposes. Therefore, the uses specified below shall
not be permitted as home occupations regardless of their conformance with the
other standards of this chapter:
Dental offices.
Electronics repair.
Limousine or taxi service.
Major appliance repair (washers, dryers, refrigerators, etc.).
Medical offices.
On site carpentry work including cabinetmaking or other similar uses which
generate noise, dust or fumes.
Painting of vehicles.
Permanent yard sales.
Photo developing.
Photo studios.
Private schools.
Sexually oriented businesses.
Tattooing.
Trailer or boat repair.
Upholstering.
Vehicle repair.
Vehicle sales.
The listing of specific prohibited businesses in this section shall not be
construed to allow or permit a home occupation business which otherwise
violates this chapter. (Ord. 13-12)
17.24.060: APPLICATION:
A home occupation application shall be filed with the city business license
division.
   A.   Home Occupation Business License: An application for a home occupation
business license shall include the following information:
      1.   A complete description of the type of business proposed including

of potential impacts from the former smelting operations which are subject to
remediation and future site management.
   C.   Compliance: No structure or use of land within the SSOD shall hereafter
be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   D.   Disclaimer Of Liability: This chapter shall not create liability on the
part of the city, the U.S. EPA, or the state of Utah, or any officer or
employee thereof, for any damages resulting from reliance on this chapter or
any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.25.060: ADMINISTRATIVE AND SPECIFIC REGULATIONS:
   A.   Establishment Of Development Permit:
      1.   A development permit shall be obtained before demolition,
excavation, construction, or change in use, as defined by the adopted code or
in this title, within any area of the SSOD.
      2.   Application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Community and Economic Development Services Division who shall
have the responsibility to review and issue said permit if appropriate. An
application conference shall be required between the applicant, applicant's
engineer, City Attorney, City Engineer, a Chief Building Official, and the
Community and Economic Development Services Manager to review the nature of
conditions for development on the site.
         a.   Use Change: For a change in use request within an existing
building, the City Attorney's Office shall determine if the use meets the
criteria identified in this section. If the City Attorney's Office determines
that the request does meet the criteria, approval shall be granted as evidenced
by the signature of the City Attorney or City Deputy Attorney on the
application. No other action under this section shall be required and the
applicant may proceed with the normal required building permit procedures for
conversion of a building. If the City Attorney's Office determines that the use
does not meet the criteria, the applicant may present to the City Attorney
further evidence for the use or the actions that will be taken to render the
use acceptable within the intent of the SSOD, as described in section
17.25.020 of this chapter.
         b.   Construction And Development Criteria:
            (1)   For any proposed construction which involves disturbance of
the soil or excavation of subsurface materials, the applicant shall refer to
the final remediation map available in the City Planning Office and Community
Development Services (showing the locations of all cap and barrier areas of the
site as well as locations of concentrations of category II, III and IV
materials). Excavation or breaks in the cap over the category II material is
prohibited. Based on the information on this map, the applicant shall submit a
plan illustrating proposed construction and development.
            (2)   Preliminary and final site plans of development as required
by section
17.60.040 of this title shall be submitted for review and approval by the
Planning Commission. The minimum size for a PUD as specified in section
17.60.030 of this title is waived and not applicable in the SSOD.
            (3)   Grading and drainage plans are required and shall
specifically assure the protection of the caps or barrier from surface runoff
or increased percolation of water into the ground water aquifer.
            (4)   A proposed monitoring and maintenance plan shall be provided
by applicant to assure all caps and barriers on the proposed development site
will be maintained in a manner consistent with the requirements of this chapter
and assuring minimum opportunity for human exposure to subsurface soils or
increased flows of ground water into the underlying aquifer. A model monitoring
and maintenance plan to guide applicants in preparation of their plan shall be
available in the City Engineer's Office.
            (5)   All subsections of section
17.60.040 of this title shall apply to the review and approval of proposals for
development in the SSOD. Approval shall be based on protection of the
remediation and the harmonious development across the district of the
architectural elements, site planning, landscaping, signage and building
relations which enhance and complement the public and private investments.
Individual projects which occur after the initial development of the site shall
occur in a manner that complements and supports the original concept. If more
than thirty three percent (33%) of the site is proposed for change, a new
design concept may be approved. Public areas of landscaping and streetscape
proposed at the time of enactment hereof must be reviewed by the Planning
Commission to assure a coherent design continues.
            (6)   The provisions of section
17.60.060 of this title are specifically excluded for purposes of this section.
            (7)   All submittals required by this chapter shall be delivered to
the Public Works Department (4 copies) and City Attorney's Office (2 copies).
            (8)   Notification of such activities shall be given to the City
and EPA at:

   B.   Excavations:
      1.   Cuts into barriers may be allowed only in accordance with this
section. A permit shall be required for all public or private agencies (public
works, telephone, cable, sewer/water utility departments, gas or electric
utilities, etc.) who wish to repair, install, access, or cross barriers over
category III materials. The City Attorney's Office, in coordination with the
Public Works Department, shall review and approve in writing all applications
for permits to assure that proper control and disposal of excavated subsurface
material will occur. The applicant, on an application form provided by the
City, shall identify the purpose of the excavation, how the opened area will be
protected from access while the cut is open, how excavated materials will be
handled to prevent their erosion by wind or water, how the excavated material
will be disposed of (e.g., backfilling the cut, off site disposal at an
approved location for the material, etc.), and the specifications for the
replacement of the barrier.
      2.   Cuts into caps over the category II soils are prohibited. If, due to
some inadvertent action, a break in the cap occurs, the City and the EPA shall
be immediately notified. Any replacement of the cap shall meet the original
criteria. Interim actions shall be taken by the City to prevent access to the
exposed materials until the cap can be replaced.
      3.   If subsurface soils are exposed or stockpiled on the site for more
than twenty four (24) hours, the applicant shall identify how the soils will be
protected from wind/water erosion and prevent public access. Fencing shall be a
minimum requirement to prevent access to exposed or stockpiled soils. If
subsurface soils are to be permanently displaced, the applicant shall identify
where on site the soils will be disposed and the type of barrier to be placed
over those soils. No subsurface soils identified as category III materials
shall be disposed of off site unless a party complies with the appropriate off
site rule as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations.
      4.   Excavations including category IV material must not occur until a
minimum health safety plan has been prepared and approved by the City. Such
plans shall contain, at the minimum, treatment of air quality, dust suppression
and disposal location(s). No category IV material shall be deposited on the
surface of the ground.
   C.   Water Supply: Water supply in the Overlay District shall be from the
City's culinary water system. Use of existing wells or creation of new wells is
prohibited in the SSOD after the effective date hereof. Monitoring wells are
excluded from this prohibition.
   D.   Storm Drainage: Drainage plans shall be required for all developments,
whether an individual building permit, subdivision or resubdivision, or planned
unit development. The runoff on a site shall not adversely affect the caps or
barriers within the SSOD. The drainage plans shall ensure erosion or
undercutting of caps or barriers does not occur. All drainage shall be directed
to the City's storm drain system. Easements and infrastructures may be required
on private grounds to assure proper drainage occurs. Any on site storage of
stormwater runoff, as part of a drainage system, shall be on impermeable
surfaces. The objective of this section is to reduce percolation of water into
the SSOD's ground water aquifer, as well as control erosion of the caps and
barriers. All wetlands shall be protected from surface runoff unless otherwise
specified in the selected remedy plan. (Ord. 18-06: Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.25.070: PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES:
With the following conditions, limitations, and exceptions, all permitted and
conditional uses allowed in the C-D District shall be permitted in the SSOD.
   A.   C-D permitted and conditional uses, provided all outdoor storage and
parking areas are paved with impermeable materials; and
   B.   C-D conditional uses not permitted:
 
1113 Single-family dwelling, attached.

   C.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the current heavy industrial uses of the
property within the site boundaries which are conducted on Sidwell parcels 21-
12-455-003 (currently occupied by Ash Grove Cement) and 22-07-301-014 and 22-
07-301-005 (currently occupied by W.R. White Company) are allowed as legal
uses, and those uses may be restored, reconstructed, extended, altered,
expanded or substituted in conformity with this chapter.
   D.   Notwithstanding the uses permitted by the underlying zoning district,
or by this section, residential uses shall not be allowed in the Smelter Site
Overlay District. (Ord. 09-14 § 2)
17.25.080: VARIANCES:
   A.   Those aggrieved by a determination made pursuant to this chapter may
appeal such decisions to any court of competent jurisdiction within thirty (30)
days from the date of determination.
   B.   Variances of approved land uses to permit residences or outdoor
industrial activities which require workers to be exposed to surface soils for
extended periods shall not be permitted.
   C.   Variances to permit access to and use of ground water shall not be
permitted. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.25.090: INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Periodic Inspections: City inspectors shall inspect construction sites
periodically to ensure compliance with the approved plans including the
requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Semiannual Inspections: At a minimum, there will be a semiannual
inspection of all caps and barriers within the SSOD to assure their condition
continues to meet the standards outlined in this section. If failure of
portions of the caps or barriers is noted, the property owner shall have thirty
(30) days to repair or replace the problem. After such time, the City shall
have the power to cause the repair or replacement and charge a lien against the
property for reimbursement plus a fifty percent (50%) penalty cost or take
whatever other legal action is deemed appropriate to assure the integrity of
the caps or barriers is maintained. Following significant severe precipitation
or runoff and seismic events, the City shall also inspect the caps and barriers
to assess any potential damage or repair needs. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.25.100: VIOLATION AND PENALTY:
Any person, firm, or corporation whether acting as owner or occupant of the
premises involved, or contractor, or otherwise, who violates or refuses to
comply with any of the provisions of this title, shall be guilty of a Class C
misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided by law. A

17.48.010: FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The City Council finds and declares:
   A.   An excess of large, unregulated signage causes visual blight on the
appearance of Murray City, and may obstruct views which can distract the
attention of motorists and pedestrians, may negatively impact local property
values, may displace alternative land uses, and may pose other problems that
legitimately call for regulation.
   B.   It is the intent of this Sign Code to preserve and enhance the
aesthetic, traffic safety, and environmental values of Murray City while at the
same time providing for ample and adequate means of communication to the
public, including, but not limited to, providing a wide latitude for a variety
and design of signs to promote local businesses within the City.
   C.   The purpose of this Sign Code is to protect and promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of Murray City residents and businesses by
reviewing the design, materials, size, construction, installation, location and
maintenance of signs and sign structures in a content neutral manner that does
not favor any type of speech over another in order to achieve the following
goals and objectives:
      1.   Reduce potential hazards to motorists and pedestrians;
      2.   Encourage signs which are integrated and harmonious to the building
and sites they occupy;
      3.   To reduce or eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays;
      4.   To preserve and improve the appearance of the City as a place in
which to live, work, and play and attract non-residents who come to visit or
trade;
      5.   To safeguard and enhance property values;
      6.   To foster a community character that has a minimum of visual
clutter. (Ord. 19-14)
17.48.020: SCOPE, INTERPRETATION AND SEVERABILITY:
   A.   It is the City's policy to regulate signs in a manner that is
consistent with free speech protections and provisions of the United States
Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Utah by enacting regulations
which do not restrict speech on the basis of its content, viewpoint or message;
and do not favor one form of speech over another.
   B.   A non-commercial message of any type may be substituted for any duly
permitted or allowed commercial message or any duly permitted or allowed non-
commercial message, provided that the sign structure or mounting device is
legal without consideration of message content. Such substitutions of message
may be made without any additional approval or permitting. This provision
prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary within this Sign
Code. The purpose of this provision is to prevent inadvertently favoring
commercial speech over non-commercial speech. This provision does not create a
right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot, building, or
structure, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting
device be properly permitted or otherwise excuse compliance with other
applicable regulations contained within this Sign Code with respect to the
physical characteristics and locations of signs.
   C.   If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, sub-paragraph, sentence,
phase, clause, term or word of this Sign Code and/or any of the provisions are
declared invalid or unconstitutional by the final judgement or decree of any
court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality
shall not affect any other portion of this Code or the provisions contained
herein. (Ord. 19-14)
17.48.030: ILLUSTRATIONS; SHORT TITLE:
   A.   The purpose of figures in this chapter is to illustrate or make these
regulations more understandable but are not a substantive part of these
regulations.
   B.   The regulations of this chapter may be referred to as the MURRAY CITY
SIGN ORDINANCE. (Ord. 19-14)

   A.   Adjustment Criteria: If the view and readability of an off-premise
sign, including a nonconforming sign as defined in Section 72-7-510 Utah Code
Annotated, is obstructed due to a noise abatement or safety measure, grade
change, construction, aesthetic improvement made by an agency of the state,
directional sign, or widening along an interstate, federal aid primary highway
existing as of June 1, 1991, or national highway systems highway, the owner of
the sign may:
      1.   Adjust the height and angle of a sign on a case by case basis to
make it clearly visible from the main traveled way of the interstate or highway
provided necessary structural modifications are made to comply with the
International Building Code; and/or
      2.   Relocate the sign to a point within five thousand two-hundred and
eighty (5,280) feet of its prior location, and no closer than five hundred
(500) feet from an off-premise sign along the same side of a street, highway or
interstate if the sign complies with spacing requirements under section 72-7-
507 Utah Code Annotated and is in a C-D, C-N, G-O, M-G, M-U, B-P or P-O zone.
   B.   Height Adjustment Not Substantial Change: A height adjusted sign under
this section does not constitute substantial change to the sign.
   C.   Visibility: The height adjusted sign may be erected to a height and
angle to make it clearly visible to traffic on the main traveled way of the
highway as defined above in subsection 17.48.270(A) of this chapter and shall
be the same size as the previous sign.
   D.   Height:
      1.   "Interstate Height" means a height that is the higher of:
         a.   Sixty five feet (65') above the ground; and
         b.   Twenty five feet (25') above the grade of the interstate.
      2.   The highest point of any off-premise sign, excluding temporary
embellishments, shall be:
         a.   For a non-interstate oriented off-premise sign:
            i.   if the height of the previous use or structure is 45 feet or
higher, the height of the previous use or structure; or
            ii.   if the height of the previous use or structure is less than
45 feet, the height of the previous use or structure or the height to make the
entire advertising content of the off-premise sign visible, whichever is
higher, but no higher than 45 feet;
         b.   For an interstate oriented off-premise sign:
            i.   if the height of the previous use or structure is at or above
Interstate Height, the height of the previous use or structure; or
            ii.   if the height of the previous use or structure is less than

chapters which apply to the zones mentioned above, EMC signs are subject to the
following restrictions:
      1.   All EMC's must have an automatic dimmer to reduce sign intensity
after dark.
      2.   EMC's shall be carefully oriented so that light emitted from a sign
is not a traffic hazard, obtrusive, or a nuisance to adjacent properties.
      3.   Persons installing or manufacturing an EMC sign which has an LED,
LCD, or flipper matrix must demonstrate that the brightness of such sign will
not exceed 0.3 foot-candles over ambient lighting conditions as measured at a
point perpendicular to the electronic sign face.  Such signs must also be
equipped with a dimmer switch to change the intensity of light emitted from the
sign to meet the 0.3 foot-candle brightness if needed after installation.
      4.   Any display on the EMC must remain lighted for at least two (2)
seconds.
      5.   An EMC located within three hundred feet (300') of a residential
use, or as otherwise determined by the Planning Commission, may not operate
between the hours of ten o’clock (10:00) P.M. and six o’clock (6:00) A.M. of
the following day, or shall hold static on a single image and shall not cause
illuminance in excess of three tenths (0.3) foot-candles over ambient lighting
conditions as measured at a point perpendicular to the electronic sign face at

processing an application. The written fee schedule will be made available for
public inspection in the City's Public Works Department. (Ord. 18-06)
17.54.060: DETERMINATION:
Applications for site plan review shall be reviewed by the Site Plan Review
Committee comprised of representatives of the City Engineering, Building, Fire,
Police, Water and Sewer, Power, Urban Forestry, and Parks and Recreation
Departments. The committee will review the proposed development and provide
recommendations which will be collected by planning staff. After reviewing the
recommendations of the Site Plan Review Committee, the Community and Economic
Development Director or designee shall determine whether the proposed
development meets the requirements of this title. In doing so, the Director may
require conditions related to bring the site into conformance with the zoning
ordinance. (Ord. 09-20 § 2)

department shall approve an application for a building permit upon submittal of
plans meeting the conditions contained in the site plan review letter.
Representatives of the community and economic development department shall
inspect the site to ensure that all required improvements meet the conditions
of the site plan review and this title before a certificate of occupancy is
issued by the building division and/or prior to the issuance of a business
license and before an application for permanent or temporary power from the
property may be approved by the city power department. (Ord. 09-20 § 2)
17.54.100: CONTINUING EFFECT:
A site plan review, once approved, affects real property regardless of change
in ownership and all subsequent owners are subject to those conditions so long
as the site is being operated. If the site or use becomes nonconforming due to
a later amendment of this title, the provisions of chapter 17.52 of this title
relating to nonconforming buildings and uses shall apply. (Ord. 09-20 § 2)

CHAPTER 17.60
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
SECTION:
17.60.010: Purpose
17.60.020: Conditional Use Permit Required
17.60.030: Required Conditions
17.60.040: Planned Unit Development Site Plan Requirements
17.60.050: Review By Planning Commission
17.60.060: Scope Of Planning Commission Action
17.60.070: Construction Limitations
17.60.010: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of the planned unit development is to allow diversification
in the relationship of various uses and structures to their sites and to permit
more flexibility in the use of such sites. The application of planned unit
concepts is intended to allow the consolidation of open spaces by clustering
dwelling units, in order to avoid environmentally sensitive areas, provide a
meaningful and usable open space and to make more efficient use of public
facilities. The application of planned unit concepts is intended to ensure
substantial compliance with the intent of zoning district regulations and other
provisions of this title related to public health, safety and general welfare.
It is not intended that this type of development be universally applied, but
only when circumstances or natural features and land use make it appropriate
and of special benefit to the residents of the development and surrounding
area.
   B.   A "planned unit development" shall mean an integrated design for
development of residential, commercial, or industrial uses, or combinations of
such uses, in which one or more of the regulations, other than use regulations
of the district in which the development is to be situated, is waived or varied
to allow flexibility and initiative in site and building design and location,
in accordance with an approved plan and imposed general requirements as
specified in this chapter. (Ord. 07-43 § 2)
17.60.020: CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT REQUIRED:
Planned unit developments may be allowed as conditional uses in all zoning
districts by the planning commission if the planned unit development fully
meets the underlying zoning district use limitations in which it is to be
located. Any approved planned unit development shall consist of a PUD plat
approved by the planning commission and signed by its chairman. A conditional
use permit for a planned unit development shall not be granted unless the
planned unit development meets the use limitations, density, and other
limitations of the zoning district in which it is to be located, except as such
requirements as may be modified as provided by this chapter or by zoning
district regulations. Compliance with the regulations of this title in no sense
excuses the developer from the applicable requirements of the subdivision and
this title, except as modifications thereof are specifically authorized in the
approval of the application for a planned unit development. The conditional use
permit shall be considered in two (2) parts:
   A.   Preliminary approval subject to the conditions of notification of
surrounding property owners in the conditional use chapter.
   B.   Final approval based on detailed drawings and specifications in general
accord with that granted at the preliminary approval. (Ord. 07-43 § 2)
17.60.030: REQUIRED CONDITIONS:
   A.   No planned unit development shall have an area of less than two (2)
acres.
   B.   A planned unit development which will contain uses not permitted in the
zoning district in which it is to be located will require a change of zoning
district and shall be accompanied by an application for a zoning amendment;
provided further, that in single-family residential zones, only single-family
dwellings may be allowed in the planned unit development. Hotels, motels,
lodges, mobile home parks, etc., shall not be considered residential uses for
the purpose of this chapter.
   C.   The development shall be in single, partnership, or corporate
ownership, or under option to purchase by an individual or a corporate entity
at the time of application or the application shall be filed jointly by all
owners of the property.
   D.   The planning commission shall require such arrangement of structures
and open spaces within the site development plan, as necessary, to assure that
adjacent properties will not be adversely affected. Lot area, lot width, yard
and coverage regulations shall be determined by approval of the site plan.
   E.   Preservation, maintenance and ownership of required open space within
the development shall be accomplished by:
      1.   Dedication of the land as a public park or parkway system in
accordance with Utah Code Annotated section 10-9a-607; or
      2.   Complying with the provisions of the condominium ownership act of
1963, title 57, chapter 8, Utah Code Annotated, 1953, as amended, which
provides for the payment of common expenses for the upkeep of the common areas
and facilities; or
      3.   Creation of a separate corporation for homeowners by which common
areas shall be owned and maintained.
   F.   Landscaping, fencing and screening related to the uses within the site
and as a means of integrating the proposed development into its surroundings
shall be planned and presented to the planning commission for approval,
together with other required plans for the development.
   G.   Open space must be provided in every planned unit development. Open
space is the part of a planned unit development which is accessible and usable
by all persons occupying dwelling units in the planned unit development. It is
any parcel or area of land or water that is improved or unimproved, and serves
the purposes of preservation of natural resources, outdoor recreation, or
public health and safety. Open space is land permanently set aside for
conservation or recreation purposes. It may include woodlands, play areas,
walking and riding trails, wetlands and lands in the floodplain as well as land
use for passive or active recreation. By way of illustration only, open space
shall not be provided from any required front or side yard, parking area,
driveway or street.
   H.   All lots or parcels in a planned unit development shall abut a public
street which is improved to standards established according to title 16,
chapter 16.16 of this code. Private streets are not permitted.
   I.   The planning commission may recommend that sidewalks and park strips be
omitted if the proposed development has an internal pedestrian system, and if
the planning commission finds that the public safety is not substantially
jeopardized. (Ord. 07-43 § 2)
17.60.040: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The applicant shall submit a planned unit development plan for the
total area within the proposed development. If the planned unit development is
to be developed on a phase basis each phase shall be of such size, composition
and arrangement that its construction, marketing and operation is feasible as a
unit independent of any subsequent phases. Final approval shall be given only
to one phase at a time.
   B.   The preliminary site plan shall show:
      1.   The use or uses, dimensions, elevations, building materials and
locations of proposed structures;
      2.   Dimensions and locations of areas to be reserved and developed for
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, parking, public uses such as schools and
playgrounds, landscaping, and open spaces;
      3.   Architectural drawings and sketches outlining the general design and
character of the proposed uses and the physical relationships of the uses;
      4.   Such other pertinent information including, but not limited to,
residential density, coverage and open space characteristics shall be included
as may be necessary to make a determination that the contemplated arrangement
of buildings and uses makes it desirable to apply regulations and requirements
differing from those ordinarily applicable under this title;
      5.   If residential development is proposed, impacts on the city schools
shall be determined;
      6.   An analysis of potential impacts on traffic and public utilities
shall be provided.
   C.   The final drawings shall show the following:
      1.   The size, location, design and nature of signs, if any, and the
intensity and direction of area floodlighting shall be detailed in the
application. However, final approval for signs will only be granted when a sign
permit is granted by the building inspection division;
      2.   A grading and drainage plan;
      3.   A planting plan showing proposed tree and shrubbery plantings with
approval of the city forester;
      4.   Covenants, conditions and restrictions;
      5.   Building materials and colors. (Ord. 07-43 § 2)
17.60.050: REVIEW BY PLANNING COMMISSION:
In order that it may approve a planned unit development, the planning
commission shall have authority to require that the following conditions (among
others it deems appropriate) be met by the applicant:
   A.   The proponents of the planned unit development have demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the planning commission that they are financially able to carry
out the proposed project.
   B.   The proponents intend to start construction within one year of the
approval of the project and any necessary zoning district change, and intend to
complete said construction within four (4) years from the date construction
begins. The planning commission may extend the time period if necessary and
deemed prudent by the planning and zoning commission.
   C.   The development is planned as one complex land use rather than an
aggregation of individual and unrelated buildings and uses.
   D.   The development as planned will accomplish the purpose outlined in
section
17.60.010 of this chapter. (Ord. 07-43 § 2)
17.60.060: SCOPE OF PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION:
In carrying out the intent of this chapter, the planning commission shall
consider the following principles:
   A.   It is the intent of this chapter that site and building plans for a
planned unit development shall be prepared by a designer or team of designers
having professional competence in urban planning as proposed in the
application. The commission may require the applicant to engage such a
qualified designer or design team.
   B.   It is not the intent of this section that control of the design of a
planned unit development by the planning commission be so rigidly exercised
that individual initiative be stifled and substantial additional expense
incurred; rather, it is the intent of this section that the control exercised
be the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of this chapter.
   C.   The planning commission may approve or disapprove an application for a
planned unit development. In approving an application the commission may attach
such conditions as it may deem necessary to secure compliance. The action of
the planning commission may be appealed to the appeal authority, in writing,
within thirty (30) calendar days after the decision is announced on the record,
by the planning commission. (Ord. 07-43 § 2)
17.60.070: CONSTRUCTION LIMITATIONS:
   A.   Upon approval of a planned unit development construction shall proceed
only in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the planning
commission and in conformity with any conditions attached by the commission to
its approval.
   B.   Amendments to approved plans and specifications for a planned unit
development shall be approved by the planning commission and shown on the
approved plans.
   C.   The building inspection division or any other city division shall not
issue any permit for any proposed building, structure, activity or use within
the project unless such building, structure, activity, or use is in accordance
with the approved development plan and any conditions imposed in conjunction
with its approval. (Ord. 07-43 § 2)

17.72.010: PURPOSE:
To reduce street congestion and traffic hazards by incorporating adequate,
attractively designed facilities for off street parking and loading as an
integral part of every land use. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.72.020: OFF STREET PARKING REQUIRED:
There shall be provided, at the time any building or structure is erected or
enlarged or increased in capacity, or any new use is established, a minimum
hard surfaced off street parking area with adequate provisions for ingress and
egress by standard sized automobiles as provided in accordance with
requirements herein.
   A.   Plans Required To Obtain A Building Permit: All applications for a
building permit shall be accompanied by a plot plan showing the required
parking spaces with ingress and egress. Said plan shall be reviewed and
approved by the planning department.
   B.   Daily Parking Facility: A lot or enclosure providing daily parking for
automobiles of those who either reside, work or transact business on the
premises. Automobiles with invalid license plates are prohibited from occupying
space on this type of facility. Hard surfacing, landscaping, protective
curbing, walls, fencing and illumination are required.
   C.   Alternatives To On Site Parking: The required off street parking for
any new use, structure or building, which, due to the size or location of the
parcel, cannot be provided on the premises, may be provided on other property
not more than two hundred feet (200') from the parcel of land to be served
measured along the shortest available pedestrian route of access. Automobiles
with invalid license plates and inspection are prohibited from occupying space
on this type of parking facility. Hard surfacing, protective curbs,
landscaping, fencing, walls and illumination are required as approved by the
planning commission.
   D.   Use Of Off Street Parking Mandatory: The owner or operator of any use,
building or structure shall ensure that those who either reside or work on the
premises shall occupy the spaces provided. Those who either work or reside on
the premises shall occupy the off street parking spaces provided. (Ord. 07-30 §
2)
17.72.030: CONTINUING OBLIGATION:
The required off street parking facilities shall be a continuing obligation of
the property owner so long as the use requiring vehicle parking or vehicle
loading facilities continues. It is unlawful for any owner of any building or
use to discontinue or dispense with the required vehicle parking facilities
without providing some other vehicle parking area which meets the requirements
of this chapter. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.72.040: CALCULATING PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Whenever parking requirements are based on square footages,
calculations shall be based on net square footage of the building or use. Net
square footage excludes restrooms, stairways, elevator shafts, mechanical and
electrical rooms, janitorial closets, lunchrooms and common areas used only for
major pedestrian movement, such as enclosed malls and public lobby areas. When
public lobby areas contain uses that generate a demand for additional parking,
they shall be included in net square footage calculations for determining
parking requirements.
   B.   When a structure or parcel contains multiple uses, more than one
parking standard may apply.
   C.   Available on street parking spaces cannot be used to meet the
requirements set forth herein. No development plans shall be based on the
assumption that excess vehicles can be parked on public streets.
   D.   When parking regulations are based on the number of employees, parking
calculations shall use the largest number of employees who work at any one
shift. Where shift changes may cause substantial overcrowding of parking
facilities, the planning commission may require additional spaces.
   E.   When parking use intensities vary during the course of the day because
of hours of operation or peak time usage, the planning commission may implement
shared parking usage based upon reasonable use standards on a case by case
basis. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.72.050: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PARKING AREAS:
   A.   All off street parking areas shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete
pavement, or comparable material and shall be graded to dispose of all surface
water. Surfacing may be installed in stages as approved by the planning
commission. All parking and grading plans shall be reviewed and approved by the
city engineer.
   B.   Parking areas shall be designed to provide orderly and safe
circulation, loading, unloading, parking and storage of vehicles. All parking
areas shall be landscaped, striped, marked and maintained according to approved
plans.
   C.   Lighting provided in off street parking areas shall be directed away
from adjoining premises and streets. The type and location of luminaires shall
be approved by the power department and planning staff.
   D.   Off street parking areas shall allow vehicles to enter and exit from a
public street by forward motion only. This regulation does not apply to parking
areas serving one- and two-family residential units.
   E.   Pavement, striping, landscaping, paintings, lighting and all other
parking area components shall be maintained to prevent deterioration and safety
hazards.
   F.   No tandem parking (1 space behind another) shall be allowed, except for
conventional single-family dwellings. Duplexes, apartments, townhouses and
condominiums may have tandem parking providing that both spaces are assigned to
the same dwelling unit and the plan is approved by the planning commission.
   G.   Off street parking spaces shall be located only behind the minimum ten
foot (10') landscaped area except for one- and two- family dwellings. (Ord. 07-
30 § 2)
17.72.060: TRANSITIONAL AREAS:
Off street parking areas which are adjacent to residential uses or residential
zoning districts shall be effectively screened on the abutting sides by a solid
barrier fence which is in compliance with the fence requirements and has been
approved by the planning commission. Such wall or fence shall be six feet (6')
in height and shall be permanently maintained. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)

The purpose of this chapter is to address planning issues resulting from the
rapid growth in demand for low power radio services. This chapter distinguishes
low power radio from other broadcasting type telecommunication technologies and
establishes provisions relating to demand, visual mitigation, noise,
engineering, residential impact, health, safety and facility siting. (Ord. 07-
30 § 2)
17.80.020: DEFINITIONS:
ANTENNA: A transmitting or receiving device used in telecommunications that
radiates or captures radio signals.
LATTICE TOWER: A self-supporting, multiple sided, open, steel frame structure
used to support telecommunications equipment.
LOW POWER RADIO SERVICES FACILITY: An unmanned structure which consists of
equipment used primarily for the transmission, reception or transfer of voice
or data through radio wave or wireless transmissions. Such sites typically
require the construction of transmission support structures to which antenna
equipment is attached.
MONOPOLE: A single cylindrical steel or wood pole that acts as the support
structure for antennas.
MONOPOLE WITH ANTENNAS AND ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURE GREATER THAN TWO FEET IN
WIDTH: A self-supporting monopole tower on which antennas or an antenna support
structure exceeding two feet (2') in width are placed; the antennas and antenna
support structure do not exceed fifteen feet (15') in width or eight feet (8')
in height.
MONOPOLE WITH ANTENNAS AND ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURE LESS THAN TWO FEET IN
WIDTH: A monopole with antennas and antenna support structure not exceeding two
feet (2') in width; antennas and antenna support structure do not exceed ten
feet (10') in height.
NONSTEALTH DESIGN: Any antenna or equipment facility not camouflaged in a
manner to blend with the surrounding land uses, features and architecture. The
design does not conceal the intended use of the telecommunications facility.
ROOF MOUNTED ANTENNA: An antenna or series of individual antennas mounted on a
flat roof, mechanical room or penthouse of a building. A roof mounted antenna
on a pitched roof must meet the standards of a stealth design facility as
interpreted by the planning commission.
STEALTH FACILITY: A wall, roof or monopole facility which is disguised as
another object or otherwise concealed from view, or designed to blend with
surrounding land uses, features and architecture, thus minimizing the aesthetic
impact on adjacent uses. The associated electronic equipment has been hidden
from view inside a building or structure and/or is made to blend in with the
surrounding land uses. Examples of stealth facilities include, but are not
limited to, trees, synthetic rocks, flagpoles, light pole standards or
architectural elements such as dormers, steeples and chimneys.
WALL MOUNTED ANTENNA: An antenna or series of individual antennas mounted
against the vertical wall of a building.
WHIP ANTENNA: An antenna that is cylindrical in shape. Whip antennas can be
directional or omnidirectional and vary in size depending upon the frequency
and gain for which they are designed. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.80.030: SCOPE:
This chapter is a specific exception to the general provisions of subsection
17.76.080B of this title, and applies to both commercial and private low power
radio services and facilities, such as "cellular" or "PCS" (personal
communications system) communications and paging systems. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.80.040: REGULATIONS:
   A.   In addition to the regulations provided in this chapter, all low power
radio service facilities shall comply with all other ordinances of the city,
and with all applicable regulations of the federal communications commission
and the federal aviation administration.
   B.   Low power radio service facilities are characterized by the type or
location of the antenna structure. There are five (5) general types of such
antenna structures: wall mounted antennas; roof mounted antennas; monopoles
with antennas and antenna support structures less than two feet (2') in width;
monopoles with antennas and antenna support structures greater than two feet
(2') in width; and lattice towers. If an antenna structure is allowed under
this title either as a permitted or as a conditional use, the minimum standards
for the installation of each type of antenna are as follows:
      1.   Wall Mounted Antenna:
         a.   Wall mounted antennas may not extend above the wall line of the
building or extend more than four feet (4') horizontally from the face of the
building.
         b.   Antennas, equipment and the supporting structure shall be painted
to match the color of the building or structure or the background against which
they are most commonly seen. Antennas and the supporting structure on buildings
shall be architecturally compatible with the building. Whip antennas are not
allowed on a wall mounted antenna structure.
         c.   Antennas mounted directly on existing parapet walls, penthouses
or mechanical equipment rooms are considered wall mounted antennas if no
portion of the antennas extends above the roofline of those building
structures.
         d.   Stealth wall mounted antennas are encouraged and shall be allowed
to vary from the provisions of this section for permitted uses, except as to
height limitations, and as determined by the planning commission, for
conditional uses. Stealth wall mounted antennas are not required to be located
with public or quasi- public uses in all residential zones.
      2.   Roof Mounted Antenna:
         a.   Roof mounted antennas are allowed only on a flat roof and shall
be screened, constructed and painted to match the structure to which they are
attached.
         b.   Roof mounted antennas may be mounted on the top of existing
penthouses or mechanical equipment rooms if the antennas and antenna support

structures may not extend more than eight feet (8') above the existing
rooflines of the penthouses or mechanical equipment rooms.
         c.   Antennas not mounted on a penthouse or mechanical equipment room
shall be mounted at least five feet (5') back from the exterior wall of the
building. The maximum height of an antenna mounted between five (5) and ten
feet (10') back from the exterior wall shall be directly proportional to the
setback distance, and may not exceed ten feet (10') above the roofline of the
building. Antennas shall be mounted at least five feet (5') behind any parapet
wall. The maximum height of an antenna mounted between five (5) and ten feet
(10') behind a parapet wall shall be directly proportional to the setback
distance, and may not exceed a height of ten feet (10') above the top of the
parapet wall. An antenna may not extend more than fifteen feet (15') above the
roofline of the building itself except as allowed as a conditional use.
Similarly, a roof mounted antenna may not extend above the roofline of a
penthouse or mechanical equipment room except as allowed as a conditional use.
         d.   Stealth roof mounted antennas are encouraged and shall be allowed
to vary from the provisions of this section for permitted uses, except as to

yard area of the affected lot or parcel, though a different location may be
approved by the planning commission to carry out the intent and purpose of
these regulations. These structures may not be located in a required landscaped
area, buffer area or required parking area. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.80.060: AREA LIMITATIONS FOR WALL AND ROOF MOUNTED ANTENNAS:
A combination of both roof and wall mounted antennas are allowed on a building.
The total area for all wall and roof mounted antennas and supporting structures
combined shall not exceed forty (40) square feet for each exterior wall of the
building or a total of one hundred sixty (160) square feet per building. A
maximum of four (4) walls may be occupied by cellular antennas. The total area
is the sum of the area of each individual antenna face and the visible portion
of the supporting structure as viewed when looking directly at the face of the
building. The total area for a roof mounted antenna shall apply to the closest
exterior wall. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.80.070: HEIGHT REGULATIONS; MONOPOLES WITH ANTENNAS:
The height of monopoles with antennas and antenna support structures is
restricted or regulated as follows: Monopoles with antennas and antenna support
structures may not exceed the lesser of sixty feet (60') in height or the
maximum allowable height limit, if any, established for the zone in which the

otherwise provided in this chapter. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.80.080: WALL AND ROOF MOUNTED ANTENNAS ON NONCOMPLYING BUILDINGS THAT EXCEED
THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT LIMIT OF THE ZONING DISTRICT:
Wall mounted antennas which otherwise are permitted or approved under this
chapter may be mounted on noncomplying buildings that exceed the maximum height
limit of the zoning district in which they are located. Roof mounted antennas
which are mounted on a noncomplying building above the maximum height limit of
the zoning district require conditional approval. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.80.090: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONAL USE REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   In addition to the conditional use standards provided in chapter 17.56,
"Conditional Uses And Zones", of this title, the following factors shall be
considered by the Planning Commission:
      1.   Compatibility of the proposed structure with the height and mass of
existing adjacent buildings and utility structures;
      2.   Whether collocation of the antenna on another existing structure in
the same vicinity, such as other monopoles, communication structures, signs,
towers, buildings, utility poles, and similar structures, is possible without
significantly affecting the antenna transmission or reception;
      3.   The location of the antenna in relation to existing vegetation,
topography and buildings to optimize visual screening;
      4.   Whether the spacing between monopoles creates detrimental impact
upon adjacent properties;
      5.   The willingness of the applicant to allow collocation on its
facility in the future for a reasonable compensation, as provided in subsection
B of this section.
   B.   The Planning Commission may, as a condition for approval, impose a
requirement that the structure be designed and engineered to reasonably allow
collocation by a subsequent provider(s) of low power radio communication
services, if collocation is feasible and consistent with sound engineering
principles. Nothing herein shall be construed to deny the owner of such a
structure from the right to receive a reasonable compensation from that
subsequent collocating provider(s) for the use of the structure. (Ord. 07-30 §
2)
17.80.100: ACCESSORY BUILDINGS FOR ANTENNA STRUCTURES:

setback, height and landscaping requirements of the zoning district in which
they are located. Monopoles shall be fenced with a six foot (6') chainlink
fence and the climbing pegs removed from the lower twenty feet (20') of the
monopole. All power lines on the lot leading to the accessory building and
antenna structure shall be installed underground. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.80.110: UNMAINTAINED OR ABANDONED FACILITIES; BONDING AND REMOVAL:
The building official is empowered to require an unmaintained or abandoned low
power radio service antenna to be removed from the building or premises when
that antenna has not been repaired or put into use by the owner, the person
having control, or the person receiving the benefit of the structure within
thirty (30) calendar days after notice is given to the owner, the person having
control, or the person receiving the benefit of the structure. The Planning
Commission may require an applicant to provide a surety bond in sufficient
amount to guaranty the obligations imposed by this section. Notices required by
this section may be given by personal service, or by certified mail addressed
to the person's last known address. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.80.120: WHERE ALLOWED:
   A.   A low power radio service facility which is not classified in this
title either as a permitted use or as a conditional use is prohibited.
   B.   A conditional use permit for a monopole with antennas and antenna
support structures less than two feet (2') in width may be granted in a

CHAPTER 17.132
INCENTIVE DENSITY BONUS
SECTION:
17.132.010: Purpose
17.132.020: Baseline Density
17.132.030: Baseline Requirements
17.132.040: Categories
17.132.050: Density Bonus Criteria
17.132.010: PURPOSE:
The objective of this chapter is to provide incentives to encourage higher
quality development by providing better design, landscaping, building
materials, off street parking facilities, energy efficiency and neighborhood
compatibility. This will provide incentive towards better housing longevity
which will stabilize and preserve neighborhoods and provide a high quality
environment in the community. This chapter provides a process by which projects
may be allowed to expand in density if they comply with the criteria outlined
in this chapter. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.132.020: BASELINE DENSITY:
Baseline density for all multiple-family zoning is that density allowed by each
multiple-family zone. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.132.030: BASELINE REQUIREMENTS:
Baseline requirements are the minimum standards which must be met for
development. This is based on complying with all zoning and building
regulations, and subdivision ordinances. Progressively higher standards are
required to gain increments of higher density. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.132.040: CATEGORIES:
These category requirements were chosen because these factors are the major
influential areas which contribute to the longevity, aesthetic, and
neighborhood compatibility of a project. The categories are as follows:
   A.   Structure Design: Structural design is the architectural appearance of
the buildings and the relationship to the site and the surrounding area. Each
successively higher level of density will require successively better design
goals. The requirements will be based on increasing variation in form, color,
scheme, materials, setbacks, floor plans, elevations, height, bulk, and
sensitivity to surrounding land use and land forms. These features must be
integrated into the total design of the site, structure and landscaping.
Variation in design must be successfully integrated in the proposal and not
treated as an afterthought to a cookie cutter plan and elevation. The goal is
to design a project that creates a planned, coordinated, functional, aesthetic
development. The project will fit in scale to the area and the site
specifically.
   B.   Landscaping: Landscape design is critical in creating a positive
environment in a project. An excellent landscape design need not incur
proportionately higher costs for the relatively high visual impact that it has
on the aesthetic value of a development. Water conservation principles will
also be considered in the total landscape scheme. Skillfully integrated into
the housing, recreational, parking, and buffer areas can greatly enhance the
sense of unity for the entire site design. Knowledgeable landscape design and
implementation can also be a positive influence on energy consumption on the
site. Landscape design requirements will be progressively more demanding as the
densities increase. More mature landscaping stock and terrain variation will be
required.
   C.   Building Materials: Building materials play a key role in the aesthetic
appearance and value of a project. Excellent building materials and finishes
promote quality and longevity in a structure. Emphasis is placed on masonry
exteriors for low maintenance characteristics. Increasing amounts of masonry
will be required for higher densities.
   D.   Parking Facilities: Location, size, and number of stalls play a vital
role in the function of good design. Parking areas must provide safe access to
public streets and to the housing on site. Parking locations are encouraged to
be located out of front yard areas with buffering, landscaping, and berming.
Areas for recreational vehicles and extra standard vehicles should be located
on site at appropriate locations and screened by barrier fencing and
landscaping. Covered parking improvements will be required by upgrading
facilities with each increment of higher density.
   E.   Urban Design/Neighborhood Compatibility: Site compatibility to
surrounding land use and structures is very critical. Design measures which can
be taken to effectively integrate a new housing development into a neighborhood
will have a highly positive impact on the way the neighbors perceive and
respond to the development. A successful design will incorporate or acknowledge
surrounding developments with emphasis in tapering height to abutting
structures. Great effort should be made to integrate architectural
compatibility with surrounding residential structures. Other features must also
be considered such as access, traffic, schools, utilities, soils, shopping,
water table, floodplains, wetlands, recreational amenities, and existing trees.
   F.   Affordable Housing: The state of Utah recognizes in Utah Code Annotated
section 10-9a-403 that the availability of moderate income housing is an
important part of the city general plan. The spirit of the statute is to ensure
that people who desire to live in Murray should be able to do so regardless of
income. People expect the city to offer a reasonable opportunity to a variety
of housing which is located throughout the community. With such an opportunity,
people with moderate incomes are allowed to benefit from and to fully
participate in all aspects of neighborhood and community life. (Ord. 07-30 § 2)
17.132.050: DENSITY BONUS CRITERIA:
To gain bonus density in any multiple-family zone through conditional use
permit, the project shall meet the criteria established under urban design/
neighborhood compatibility, energy efficiency, structure design, landscaping,
affordable housing, and parking facilities. Portions of the density bonus
criteria may be waived or modified by the planning commission based upon
project performance which complies with the intent and purpose of this chapter.
The burden of proof rests with the applicant where such waivers or
modifications are requested.

The purpose of a Mixed Use Development District is to encourage pedestrian
oriented design, promote development and protect the public health, safety and
welfare. The district encourages compact, mixed use development. Carefully
planned mixed uses, including neighborhood oriented commercial and restaurant
space, provide increased opportunities for pedestrian activity. It is
established to preserve and encourage the pedestrian character of commercial
areas and to promote street life and activity by regulating building
orientation and design and accessory parking facilities. The district is
facilitated by site and community design standards that:
   A.   Encourage high quality, compact development and increase the number of
residents and workers within walking distance of transit opportunities;
   B.   Encourage a mix of high quality residential, office, commercial, live-
work, open space, entertainment, recreation, public and institutional land
uses;
   C.   Revitalize areas proximate to transit stations;
   D.   Improve the urban design in the area;
   E.   Encourage active community life within a framework of attractive and
welcoming buildings and usable open spaces;
   F.   Coordinate the urban design and streetscape elements in order to create
a distinct visual quality for the area;
   G.   Manage parking and access in a manner that enhances pedestrian safety,
pedestrian mobility and quality urban design;
   H.   Encourage structured parking, new roads and public open spaces to
enhance the design and function of the built environment;
   I.   Encourage a safe, attractive and comfortable environment for the
pedestrian and bicyclist by providing public open spaces, public pedestrian
walkways, wide sidewalks, bike lanes, street furniture, pedestrian scale
lighting, street trees and other appropriate amenities;
   J.   Encourage conservation of resources and optimal use of public
infrastructure toward a sustainable community;
   K.   Require property owners, developers, architects, and contractors to use
a mix of high quality, durable, low maintenance building materials for projects
in this zoning district. (Ord. 10-04 § 2)

   A.   The front setback for buildings facing public or private streets
excepting courtyards and plazas, shall be between fifteen feet (15') and twenty
five feet (25') from the back of curb and gutter.  Buildings with setbacks
between fifteen feet (15') and eighteen feet (18') must utilize recessed
entrances.  Up to fifty percent (50%) of the front setback may be greater than
twenty five feet (25') if the additional front setback is developed as a
courtyard or plaza. Buildings may have detached components within a courtyard
or plaza if the uses in the detached component enhance activity on the
courtyard or plaza.  (insert figure a., illustration of public and private
setbacks)
   B.   The courtyard or plaza area shall be deemed to be a part of the front
setback of the building.
   C.   Buildings located on a corner lot shall front on both streets.
   D.   All front setback areas shall be landscaped in accordance with
applicable sections of this title.
   E.   Parking and/or driveways are not permitted in the front setback area of
any building.  Drive-thru lanes and other accesses may be approved in front
setback areas as part of a Master Site Plan if the Planning Commission finds
that the purposes and other requirements of the M-U Zone are met. 
   F.   When located within one-half mile of a transit station, commercial uses
shall occupy a minimum of seventy five percent (75%) of the width of the ground
floor of a building facing a public street. When located more than one-half
mile from a transit station, commercial uses shall occupy a minimum of fifty
percent (50%) of the width of the ground floor of a building facing a public
street.  When located on the ground floor of the same building, the commercial
uses must extend forty feet (40') in depth.  The balance of the ground floor
may be occupied by residential uses, including parking.  Horizontal Mixed Use
projects shall provide a minimum commercial square footage component equal to
an area calculated as seventy five percent (75%) of the project frontage on the
public street and forty feet (40') in depth.  For projects which comprise
multiple parcels, square footage shall be calculated based on total project
frontage on the public street.
   G.   A Master Site Plan approved by the Planning Commission is required for
Horizontal Mixed Use Developments and Mixed Use developments located on a
parcel or combination of parcels greater than five (5) acres.  In addition to
the requirements of this zone, the Planning Commission shall address the
following when considering the Master Site Plan:
      1.    Building Orientation:  Commercial and residential buildings in the
same project should primarily be oriented to face public and private streets
and accesses, and not parking lots.  The orientation of commercial buildings in
mixed use projects should consider the residential components of the project
and facilitate convenient access to them.
      2.   Central Feature:  A prominent, centrally located feature such as a
park, plaza, or other gathering place should be provided to unify the
residential and commercial uses of the project.  This location should include
features and amenities to encourage public use and activity, with convenient
access from both residential and commercial components of the development.
      3.   Outdoor Spaces:  To the extent possible, buildings should be
designed to form outdoor spaces such as courtyards, plazas, and terraces that
can integrate the components of the development.  Pedestrian walkways linking
the components of the development with these outdoor spaces and the public
streets should be developed.  Where possible, the potential linkages to
existing and future adjacent developments should be considered.
      4.    Memorandum Of Understanding:  Mixed Use developments that require a
Master Site Plan shall be approved in conjunction with a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between Murray City and the developer.  The MOU shall
govern requirements for the timing of the installation of improvements,
performance on construction of critical development components, and shall
further memorialize the requirements for development of the several buildings
and parcels as contained in the Master Site Plan and other project approvals.
   H.   Maintenance buildings, trash collection and recycling areas, storage
and service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall not be
permitted in the front setback of any building. Single or ganged utility meters
or other service equipment may be located in the front setback of any building,
provided there are site constraints which preclude their access in a location
elsewhere on site, and they are screened and approved by the city.
   I.   The side lot area between non-adjoining buildings and the property line
shall be developed as parking, plaza, landscaped open space, or a landscaped
walkway with access to the sidewalk. Where parking is located in the side lot
area adjacent to a property boundary a five foot (5') wide landscaping area
will be required along all property lines not occupied by drive accesses.
   J.   A parking structure fronting on a street shall have a front setback of
between fifteen feet (15') and twenty five feet (25') from the back of curb and
gutter. The parking structure front setback shall not be less than the setback
of the main building. The face of the structure abutting the street shall have
building materials compatible with the main buildings on the same or adjoining
property. The area between the sidewalk and the parking structure shall have a
minimum of ten feet (10') of landscaping or shall provide window treatment
consistent with subsection 17.146.070B of this chapter.
   K.   Surface parking lots shall have a minimum setback of between fifteen
feet (15') and twenty five feet (25') from the curb. Surface parking shall be
located to the side or behind the building. The area between the sidewalk and
the parking lot shall have a minimum of ten feet (10') of landscaping. The
remainder of the area between the required landscaping and parking shall be a
combination of plazas, artwork, fountains, and pedestrian ways. In no case
shall the parking be set back from the street less than the building.
   L.   There shall be a minimum fifty foot (50') setback from the top of the
bank of Little Cottonwood Creek, Big Cottonwood Creek and the Jordan River.

authority of the Planning Commission to review building materials, design
elements and other aesthetic considerations as it deems proper to mitigate or
modify the visual impact of the height of buildings upon surrounding land uses.
   D.   Decision Of Building Official: The City building official shall
determine the height of a building under this section. That decision is deemed

17.168.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of a Transit Oriented Development District (TOD) is to encourage
pedestrian oriented design, promote development and protect the public health,
safety and welfare by preserving the unique character of existing areas for
future use and development. The TOD encourages compact, mixed use development
near transit stops. Carefully planned mixed uses, including neighborhood
oriented commercial and restaurant space, provide increased opportunities for
transit and pedestrian activity. It is established to preserve and encourage
the pedestrian character of commercial areas and to promote street life and
activity by regulating building orientation and design and accessory parking
facilities while prohibiting certain high impact and automobile oriented uses.
A TOD is facilitated by site and community design standards that:
   A.   Encourage high quality, compact development and increase the number of
residents and workers within walking distance of transit opportunities;
   B.   Encourage a mix of high quality residential, office, commercial, live-
work, open space, entertainment, recreation, public and institutional land
uses;
   C.   Revitalize areas proximate to transit stations;
   D.   Improve the urban design in the area;
   E.   Encourage active community life within a framework of attractive and
welcoming buildings and usable open spaces;
   F.   Coordinate the urban design and streetscape elements in order to create
a distinct visual quality for the area;
   G.   Manage parking and access in a manner that enhances pedestrian safety,
pedestrian mobility and quality urban design;
   H.   Efficiently use public and private resources by reducing parking
requirements for development in close proximity to a transit stop;
   I.   Provide incentives for structured parking, new roads and public open
spaces to enhance the design and function of the built environment;
   J.   Encourage a safe, attractive and comfortable environment for the
pedestrian and bicyclist by providing public open spaces, public pedestrian
walkways, wide sidewalks, bike lanes, street furniture, pedestrian scale
lighting, street trees and other appropriate amenities. (Ord. 07-36 § 2)
17.168.020: TOD BOUNDARIES:

within the TOD shall be developed in conformance with the provisions set forth
herein and with the TOD Guidelines. For purposes of this chapter, landscaping
requirements and encroachment allowances shall be governed by the TOD
Guidelines. All uses shall meet the requirements and standards set forth in
this chapter. (Ord. 07-36 § 2)

of the record to determine whether the decision was so unreasonable as to be
arbitrary and capricious. (Ord. 19-40)
17.170.060: HISTORIC PRESERVATION:
The preservation, restoration, re-use and/or incorporation of historically
significant buildings into new development within the MCCD zone is encouraged
wherever possible. Applications for design review approval that include the
alteration, renovation, or demolition in whole or in part of any of the
historically significant buildings identified herein shall be subject to
special considerations outlined in this section.
A.   Designation Of Historically Significant Buildings: A list of designated
historically significant buildings located within the MCCD zone shall be
maintained by the Community and Economic Development Department. Buildings
designated as historically significant are subject to the special
considerations of this section. A property owner may remove their property from
the list of designated historically significant buildings by submitting a
written request to the Community and Economic Development Department or the
office of the Mayor. The City shall update the list and respond in writing to
the property owner demonstrating the removal within thirty (30) days of the
receipt of the written request. The Mayor shall notify the City Council of the
removal of a property from the list of historically significant buildings
within thirty (30) days of the removal.
B.   Relocation: Relocation of an existing significant historic building is
allowed if approved by the Planning Commission after following the design
review approval process, if it can be demonstrated that the historical
character of the building can be preserved. Application and permit fees for
projects involving the relocation of historically significant buildings will be
waived. Fees to be waived include fees for design review approval, conditional
use permits, building permits, sign permits, land disturbance permits, and
excavation permits.
C.   Renovation: Any renovation of all or part of a historically significant
building will be considered a major alteration. Application and permit fees for
projects involving the renovation of historically significant buildings will be
waived. Fees to be waived include fees for design review approval, conditional
use permits, building permits, sign permits, land disturbance permits, and
excavation permits.
D.   Alteration And/Or Demolition: Alteration or demolition of designated
historically significant buildings is considered a major alteration and
requires design review approval. Design review approval for projects involving
the demolition of designated historically significant buildings is subject to
the following requirements:
   1.   Adherence: The Planning Commission must find that the proposed
development requiring demolition of the historically significant building
demonstrates adherence to the goals and objectives of the Murray City general
plan and the MCCD zone.
   2.   Monument: If demolition is granted, the applicant must propose and
install a monument with a narrative inscription describing the historical
significance of the building, or a public arts project commemorating the same.
The monument or commemoration should be incorporated into the project at or
near the original location of the historically significant building and will be
installed at the applicant's expense. The location, design, and content of the
narrative inscription of the monument must be reviewed by the Murray City
History Advisory Board for recommendation to the Planning Commission as a
component of the design review application.
   3.   Memorandum Of Understanding: A memorandum of understanding must be
executed between the City and applicant regarding the project. The memorandum
of understanding must be approved by the City Council prior to the issuance of
demolition permits. The memorandum of understanding must establish the
following:
      a.   That there is immediacy of the project and thus for demolition. A
development time line must be submitted demonstrating a twenty four (24) month
project completion period for that portion of the project where a historically
significant building is to be demolished;
      b.   That demolition of the historically significant building shall not
occur until a building permit has been issued for the proposed development or
phase of the development that requires the demolition.
      c.   That the History Advisory Board has approved a monument and
inscription as required by this section. The memorandum will establish the
receipt of a bond from the applicant with the City to provide for the
installation of the monument and inscription.
E.   Land Use, Interior Arrangement, Maintenance, Emergency Repairs Not
Considered:
   1.   Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a property owner from
making any use of his or her property not prohibited by other statutes,
ordinances or regulations.
   2.   The ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural
feature of a building in areas which do not involve replacing the feature or a
change in design, material, color or outer appearance thereof, shall not be
prevented by the requirements of this chapter.
   3.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent:
      a.   The maintenance; or
      b.   In the event of an emergency, the immediate restoration of any
existing aboveground utility structure without approval by the Commission.
   4.   The construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or
demolition of any exterior architectural features, which the City building
inspector or similar official shall certify is required for public safety
because of an unsafe or dangerous condition, shall not be prevented by the
requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 19-40)

17.170.080: SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS:
A.   The City has adopted the goal of pursuing and achieving sustainable
development practices in the MCCD. No sustainable development certifications
are required under this section, however, the City encourages sustainable
development through green building rating or certification systems such as
LEED, the State of Utah Division of Facilities and Construction Management
High-Performance Building Standards, or the equivalent. The City may provide
incentives for developers who achieve third-party sustainable development
certification for buildings.
B.   Any incentives provided will be based on post-performance outcomes,
negotiated specifically for each development project and specified through a
development agreement which shall be approved by the City Council and/or the
Redevelopment Agency of Murray City.
   1.   Sustainability focus areas include water conservation, stormwater
management, energy efficiency and support of transit and active transportation.
   2.   Sustainable development principles and goals are further defined in the
MCCD design guidelines and are recommended as standards for the development of
the area.
C.   The City recognizes that, regardless of third-party certification level,
there are standards that are in the best interest of the health, safety, and
general welfare of the residents of Murray. Standards to promote efficient and
sustainable development have been included in the parking, landscaping and
building and site design standards of the MCCD and are required whether or not
an individual development attains a third-party sustainable development
certification. In addition, all new public buildings and uses shall, as
practicable, be designed and built to comply with the High-Performance Building
Standards developed by the Utah Division of Facilities Construction and
Management. (Ord. 19-40)
17.170.090: AREA, WIDTH, FRONTAGE AND YARD REGULATIONS:
The main entry to a building should provide a strong connection to the street,
one which is expressive, welcoming and easily located. The following standards
for setbacks or facades and entries are intended to contribute to the vibrant,
connected, active, pedestrian oriented streetscape that is envisioned for the
district:
A.   Proposed development must be designed such that building facades occupy a
minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the total linear feet of property frontage on
public and streets with setbacks between twelve feet (12') and eighteen feet
(18') from the back of curb and gutter; or
B.   If greater setbacks are proposed to accommodate site features such as
outdoor dining or gathering spaces:
   1.   All street facing building facades are to be designed so that eighty
percent (80%) of the total linear feet are within twenty five feet (25') from
the back face of curb and gutter.
   2.   Municipal, public or quasi-public buildings may have a greater setback
as determined through the design review process. The additional setback shall
require the development of public plazas, parks or open spaces and comply with
the design standards within this chapter. (Ord. 19-40)
17.170.100: PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS AND STREET CHARACTER:
A.   Construction of new buildings or renovations of existing buildings where
the cost of improvements or renovations to a property or site exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the assessed value of the buildings on the property shall
include construction and installation of the adjacent sidewalks, park strips
and other landscaping, curbs, gutters, lighting, and street furniture as
required in this chapter and as further described in the design guidelines.
B.   The improvements within the rights-of-way for public streets shall
include, but not be limited to, the following standards:
   1.   The right-of-way widths within the Murray City Center District vary
from one hundred forty feet (140') to seventy feet (70') and respond to the
site conditions and traffic volume. There are five (5) primary public streets
that run through the Murray City center including State Street, 5th Avenue, Box
Elder Street, Hanauer Street, 4800 South, and Vine Street;
   2.   Within the right-of-way, the drive lanes vary from ten feet (10') to
twelve feet (12') with most streets having seven (7) to eight foot (8') on
street parallel parking areas. A minimum twelve foot (12') pedestrian sidewalk
is included within the right-of-way that includes a seven (7') pedestrian zone
along with a five foot (5') furnishing or landscape strip between the sidewalk
and edge of curb.
C.   Benches and other street furniture shall be provided and spaced as
approved by the City through the design review process.
D.   All streets and sidewalks shall be available for general public use and
access and not gated.
E.   District standard street furniture shall be used for public sidewalks,
seating areas, and trails to provide visual continuity. Courtyards, pedestrian
ways, plazas, and seating areas located on private property should also include
furnishings that are compatible with the projects and surrounding areas in
which they are located.

(Ord. 19-40)
17.170.110: BUILDING DESIGN, SCALING AND DENSITY:
A.   The primary entrance to buildings must be clearly identifiable and must be
oriented to face a street, plaza or pedestrian way. Other street facing entries
must appear at least once every seventy five feet (75') on average. Alternate
designs for public, quasi-public, and commercial buildings may be approved if
the Planning Commission finds that there are demonstrated security concerns
which cannot be reasonably mitigated without the elimination of multiple
entries as required here.
B.   The functional entry of new buildings must be oriented to face the public
street, public square, park, or plaza, but not a parking lot.
C.   The primary entrance to a building shall have a pedestrian scaled facade.
D.   Building entries must be covered with canopies/awnings and/or recessed
entries.
E.   Building entries must meet all local, State, and Americans With
Disabilities Act accessibility requirements.
F.   For corner buildings, entries are required on both street facades.
G.   All front setback areas, if proposed, shall be landscaped or used as
pedestrian ways, plazas, courtyards, or for outdoor seating and dining areas.
H.   Off-street parking is not permitted in the front setback area and/or
between the street and building. Parking shall be located to the side or rear
of the building. However, parking associated with municipal, public, or quasi-
public buildings may be located between the street and the building provided
that the parking serves multiple uses or planned multiple uses.
I.   Maintenance buildings, trash collection and recycling areas, storage and
service areas, mechanical equipment and loading docks shall not be permitted in
the front setback of any building. Single or ganged utility meters or other
service equipment may be located in the front setback of any building;
provided, there are site constraints which preclude their access in a location
elsewhere on site, and they are screened and approved by the City.
J.   The side lot area between non-adjoining buildings and the property line
shall be developed as parking, plaza, landscaped open space, or a landscaped
walkway with access to the sidewalk.
K.   Encroachments may project into the public right-of-way provided that the
encroachments are between nine feet (9') and seventeen feet (17') above the
sidewalk height, subject to City and Utah Department of Transportation approval
where applicable. They must not obstruct or prevent the placement of street
trees or other improvements within the public right-of-way.
L.   Blank walls shall not occupy over fifty percent (50%) of a principal
frontage. Non-residential buildings and structures shall not have a section of
blank wall exceeding thirty (30) linear feet without being interrupted by a
window or glass entry door. All development shall provide ground floor windows
on the building facade and adjacent to a public or private street, including
private pedestrian only streets, parks, paths, or courts. Darkly tinted windows
and mirrored windows which block visibility are prohibited as ground floor
windows. Alternate designs for public, quasi-public, and commercial buildings
may be approved if the Planning Commission finds that there are demonstrated
security concerns that cannot be reasonably mitigated with full compliance to
this requirement.
M.   Ground level unit entries shall have a finished floor less or equal to
twenty four inches (24") above sidewalk grade.
N.   Exceptions to these standards are allowed if buildings are located in
designated open space area as identified in the design guidelines. Structures
located or being relocated into these areas shall be allowed residential
setback standards.
O.   Commercial uses shall occupy the width of the ground floor of multi-story
residential buildings facing a public street for a minimum depth of forty feet
(40'). The balance of the ground floor may be occupied by residential uses or
parking. A leasing office or lobby allowing access to the upper floors may
occupy no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the ground floor or one thousand
(1,000) square feet, whichever is less. Horizontal mixed-use projects shall
provide a minimum commercial square footage component equal to an area
calculated as one hundred percent (100%) of the project frontage on the public
street and forty feet (40') in depth. For projects which comprise multiple
parcels, square footage shall be calculated based on total project frontage on
the public street.
P.   A master site plan approved by the Planning Commission is required for
horizontal mixed-use developments and mixed-use developments located on a
parcel or combination of parcels greater than five (5) acres. In addition to
the requirements of the MCCD zone, the Planning Commission shall address the
following when considering the master site plan:
   1.   Building Orientation: Commercial and residential buildings in the same
project should primarily be oriented to face public and private streets and
accesses, and not parking lots. The orientation of commercial buildings in
mixed-use projects should consider the residential components of the project
and facilitate convenient access to them.
   2.   Central Feature: A prominent, centrally located feature such as a park,
plaza, or other gathering place should be provided to unify the residential and
commercial uses of the project. This location should include features and
amenities to encourage public use and activity, with convenient access from
both residential and commercial components of the development.
   3.   Outdoor Spaces: To the extent possible, buildings should be designed to
form outdoor spaces such as courtyards, plazas, and terraces that can integrate
the components of the development. Pedestrian walkways linking the components
of the development with these outdoor spaces and the public streets should be
developed. Where possible, the potential linkages to existing and future
adjacent developments should be considered.
   4.   Memorandum Of Understanding: Mixed-use developments that require a
master site plan shall be approved in conjunction with a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) between Murray City and the developer. The MOU shall govern
requirements for the timing of the installation of improvements, performance on
construction of critical development components, and shall further memorialize
the requirements for development of the several buildings and parcels as
contained in the master site plan and other project approvals.
Q.   The maximum residential density for a project shall not exceed one hundred
(100) units per acre. (Ord. 19-40)
17.170.120: HEIGHT REGULATIONS:
There are no height restrictions in the district except as provided herein:
A.   For new buildings located west of State Street and south of 4800 South, a
minimum height of forty feet (40') or four (4) stories, whichever is less, is
required;

thirty-five feet (135'), whichever is less. A pedestrian scaled facade must be
provided on lower floors;
D.   Buildings located east of State Street are exempt from the minimum height
requirement;
E.   Public or quasi-public utility buildings and structures are exempt from
the minimum height regulations above. This exemption does not include office
buildings for public or quasi-public utility companies. (Ord. 19-40)
17.170.130: LIGHTING STANDARDS:
A.   Street and sidewalk lighting shall meet adopted City light design
standards.
B.   Illumination levels shall not exceed IESNA recommended standards.
C.   Lighting shall be provided for pedestrian ways that is appropriately
scaled to walking. Light standards shall not be taller than sixteen feet (16').
However, light standards adjacent to State Street or 4500 South (major arterial
roadways), as well as Vine Street and 4800 South (major collector roadways) are
allowed up to twenty-three feet (23') in height. Light standard height will be
reviewed on a case by case basis by City staff.
D.   Lighting shall be shielded and directed downward to prevent any off-site
glare.
E.   All site lighting luminaires will conform to IESNA "cutoff" or "sharp
cutoff" classification. City staff will provide additional details as needed.
F.   For property owner installed private lighting, metal halide and induction
lamp sources may be used subject to approval by the City Power Department and
CED staff. Building facade lighting must be shielded and directed downward to
avoid light trespass and illumination of the night sky.
G.   Banners may be attached to banner arms on light standards between sixteen
feet (16') and twenty three feet (23') in height. A top banner arm is required
with a bottom eyelet, or eyebolt for a banner to be attached to a light
standard (see
chapter 17.48, "Sign Code", of this title). The bottom of a banner must be at
least eight feet (8') above a walkway, surfaced area, or ground level below.
(Ord. 19-40)
17.170.140: PARKING REGULATIONS:
This section establishes the standards for the amount, location, and
development of motor vehicle parking, standards for bicycle parking, and
standards for on-site loading areas in the MCCD. Other titles of this code and
guidelines of the MCCD may regulate other aspects of parking and loading.
A.   General Regulations:
   1.   General: The regulations of this chapter apply to all parking areas in
the MCCD, whether required by this code or constructed for the convenience of
property owners or users. Parking areas include those that are accessory to a
use, part of a commercial parking use, or for a park and ride facility in the
community services use category.
   2.   Occupancy: All parking areas must be paved, striped and landscaped
prior to occupancy of any structure unless a deferral agreement is completed
with appropriate security as allowed in section
17.76.110 of this title.
   3.   Calculations Of Amounts Of Required And Allowed Parking:
      a.   When computing parking spaces based on floor area, areas inside of
structures which are used for parking are not counted;
      b.   The number of parking spaces is computed based on the primary uses
on the site except as stated in subsection B3 of this section. When there are
two (2) or more separate primary uses on a site, the required or allowed
parking is the sum of the required or allowed parking for the individual
primary uses;
      c.   For joint use parking, see subsection B3 of this section;
      d.   When more than twenty percent (20%) of the floor area on a site is
in an accessory use, parking is calculated separately for the accessory use;
      e.   On street parking spaces immediately adjacent to the property may
not be used to meet the parking requirements set forth herein.
   4.   Use Of Required Parking Spaces: Required parking spaces must be
available for the use of residents, customers, or employees of the use. Fees
may be charged for the use of required off street parking spaces. Required
parking spaces may not be assigned in any way to a use on another site, except
for joint parking situations. See subsection B3 of this section. Also, required
parking spaces may not be used for the parking of equipment or storage of goods
or inoperable vehicles.
   5.   Proximity Of Parking To Use: Required parking spaces for residential
uses must be located on the site of the use or within a tract owned in common
by all the owners of the properties that will use the tract or in public
parking facilities. Required parking spaces for non-residential uses must be
located on the site of the use or in parking areas within five hundred feet
(500') of the development site property boundary.
   6.   Stacked Parking:
      a.   The requirements for parking spaces and all parking area development
standards continue to apply for stacked parking.
      b.   Stacked (individual mechanical lift), tandem, or valet parking is
allowed for non-residential sites if an attendant is present to move vehicles.
If stacked parking is used for required parking spaces, some form of guarantee
or affidavit must be filed with the City ensuring that an attendant will always
be present when the lot is in operation.
      c.   Tandem parking is allowed for residential sites if parking spaces
(front and back stalls) are reserved or designated for a single unit. Each
stall constitutes a separate stall as counted toward the total required number
of parking stalls.
      d.   Stacked (multiple mechanical lift systems, or other automatic
parking where individuals are not required to manually access and control the
equipment) may be utilized for all uses without requiring an on-site attendant.
      e.   Proper equipment safety labels, operational protocols, equipment
maintenance and other fire, life and safety issues must be reviewed and
approved by all applicable City departments and meet any International Building
Code and any other applicable Plumbing, Electric, or Building Codes.
   7.   Buildings That Exceed Four (4) Stories: For parking for buildings that
exceed four (4) stories in height, at least fifty percent (50%) of the parking
shall be located within the exterior walls of the building or in a parking
structure that is within seven hundred fifty feet (750') of the main building.
   8.   Parking And Access Review And Approval: In addition to Community and
Economic Development Department review, the Streets Division and Engineering
Division shall review the layout of parking areas, curb cut and access
restrictions as set forth in
chapter 17.72, "Off Street Parking And Motor Vehicle Access Standards", of this
title. Parking for projects located along State Street shall also require
approval from the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) related to access
locations, curb cuts, and the like.
B.   Required Parking Spaces:
   1.   Purpose: The purpose of required parking spaces is to provide enough
on-site parking to accommodate the majority of traffic generated by the range
of uses which might locate at the site over time. Mixed-use sites that are
located in close proximity to transit, have good street connectivity, and good
pedestrian facilities may need less off-street parking than other types of
development. Transit supportive plazas and bicycle parking may be substituted
for some required parking on a site to encourage transit use and bicycling by
employees and visitors to the site. The required parking numbers correspond to
broad use categories, not specific uses, in response to this long term
emphasis. Provision of carpool parking located close to the building entrance
will encourage carpool use.
   2.   Required Parking Spaces For The MCCD: Table A of this section outlines
the required number of spaces for each specified use category. The standards of
table A of this section apply to the entire MCCD unless specifically superseded
by other portions of this code.

maximum                   parking structures or within the envelope of the
                          building
 
   3.   Joint Use Parking: Joint use of required parking spaces may occur where
two (2) or more uses on the same or separate sites are able to share the same
parking spaces because their parking demands occur at different times. Joint
use of required non-residential parking spaces is allowed if the following
documentation is submitted in writing to the City Planning Commission as part
of a building or zoning permit application or land use review:
      a.   The names and addresses of the uses and of the owners or tenants
that are sharing the parking;
      b.   The location and number of parking spaces that are being shared;
      c.   An analysis showing that the peak parking times of the uses occur at
different times and that the parking area will be large enough for the
anticipated demands of both uses; and
      d.   A legal instrument such as an easement or deed restriction that
guarantees access to the parking for both uses.
   4.   Limit On Size: If the total parking area of a project exceeds two (2)
acres, it shall be divided into a series of separate lots. No single parking
area shall exceed one (1) acre.
   5.   Carpool Spaces: For new commercial and non-residential portions of
mixed-use buildings, the number of carpooling parking spaces equivalent to ten
percent (10%) of the total automobile parking for each non-residential and
mixed- use building on the site. Signage indicating carpool parking spots must
be provided. Carpool parking must be within two hundred feet (200') of
entrances to buildings served.
   6.   Compact Stalls: Compact stalls may be used within the MCCD and shall

parking spaces that meet the short or long term bicycle parking standards, the
motor vehicle parking requirement may be reduced by one (1) space. Parking
existing prior to the effective date hereof may be converted in accordance with
this provision. Bicycle parking is required for most use categories to
encourage the use of bicycles by providing safe and convenient places to park
bicycles. These regulations ensure adequate short and long term bicycle parking
based on the demand generated by the different use categories and on the level
of security necessary to encourage the use of bicycles for short and long
stays. Bicycle racks shall be placed on every development as follows:
      a.   The minimum number of bicycle parking spaces for any use shall be
five percent (5%) of the vehicular parking spaces required for such use, up to
a maximum of twelve (12) spaces;

17.174.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Professional Office District P-O is to provide for mixed-use
areas where urban public services are available or planned including access to
high capacity transit. The intensity and quality of development will be higher
than in other employment designations and urban in character. Development
patterns adjacent to residential areas should enhance livability while
contributing to the success of nearby businesses. This district requires site
and design standards that:
   A.   Encourage high quality development while increasing the number of
employers and jobs with the City;
   B.   Allow for the revitalization of areas within proximity to transit
stations;
   C.   Improve the urban design and streetscape elements in order to create a
distinct visual quality for the area;
   D.   Encourage structured parking, new roads and public open spaces to
enhance the design and function of the built environment;
   E.   Encourage a safe, attractive and comfortable environment for the
pedestrian and bicyclist by providing appropriate open space and landscape
buffers, public sidewalks, bike lanes and other amenities as needed;
   F.   Encourage property owners, developers, architects, and contractors to
use a mix of high quality, durable, low maintenance building materials which
comply with the High Performance Building Standards developed by the Utah
Division of Facilities Construction and Management or comparable third-party
sustainable development standards. (Ord. 19-07: Ord. 18-09)

open space zone. Such setbacks will be determined during the site plan review
process. In the event that the rear of the building faces an arterial or
collector street, there shall be a setback of twenty feet (20'). The Planning
Commission may reduce this if in its judgment the reduction provides a more
efficient use of the property.
