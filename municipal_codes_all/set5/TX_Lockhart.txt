PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Lockhart, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through October 3, 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Editor's note- Printed herein is the home rule charter of the city, as adopted by the voters on February 23, 1973. Amendments to the charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

PREAMBLE

    The city council shall have the power by ordinance to grant to any owner of property abutting upon the streets or other property of the city, the use thereof or to go over or under the same in any manner which may be necessary or proper to the enjoyment of said abutting property by the owner; provided, however, that such use be not inconsistent with, and does not unreasonably impair the public use to which said street or other public property may be dedicated, or the use being made of the same by a public service franchise holder from the city. The city council shall fix the terms and conditions of any such grant and the time for which it shall exist. Whether expressed or not the right is expressly reserved to the city, acting through the city council, to terminate such license when deemed inconsistent with the public use of the property of the city and when the same may become a nuisance. 
Sec. 10.11. - Revocable license. 
    The city council shall have the power to grant minor or temporary privileges in the streets, public ways and public places of the city by ordinance or resolution.

The accounts shall show actual capital cost to the city of each public utility owned, also the cost of all extensions, additions, and improvements and the source of funds expended for such capital purposes. They shall show as nearly as possible the cost of any service furnished to or rendered by any such utility to any city government department. The city council shall cause an annual report to be made by a certified public accountant and shall publish such report showing the financial results of such city ownership and operation, giving the information specified in this section and such other data as the city council shall deem expedient. 
Sec. 10.13. - Sales of electricity, water and sewer services. 
(a)  The city council shall have the power and authority to sell and distribute electricity and water and to sell and provide for sewer services and any other utilities to any person, firm or corporation outside the limits of the City of Lockhart, and to permit them to connect with said system under contract with the city, under such terms and conditions as may appear to be for the best interests of the city; provided the charges fixed for such services outside the city limits shall be reasonable when considered in the light of all circumstances, to be determined by the city council. 
(b)  The city council shall have the power and authority to prescribe the kind of materials used within or beyond the limits of the City of Lockhart where it furnishes the service, and to inspect the same and require them to be kept in good order and condition at all times and to make such rules and regulations as shall be necessary and proper, and prescribe penalties for noncompliance with same.

ARTICLE 11. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 11.01. - Publicity of records. 
    The Texas Public Information Act (the TPIA) applies to information of the city. "Public information" means information that is collected, assembled, or maintained under a law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by the city. Public information is available to the public during the normal business hours of the city. Information of the city is public unless it falls within a specific exception as provided in the TPIA. The TPIA is triggered when a person submits a written request to the city, asking for records or information already in existence. The city is not required to create new information, do legal research, or answer questions. A person may ask to view the information, get copies of the information, or both. The city may charge for copies, and under certain limited circumstances, it may charge for access to information. Generally, where the city wishes to withhold information pursuant to an exception provided in the TPIA, the city must refer the matter to the Texas Attorney General for a ruling within ten (10) business days of receiving the request.

A public official may not appoint, confirm the appointment or vote for the appointment or confirmation of the appointment of an individual to a position that is to be directly or indirectly compensated from public funds if the individual is related to the public official within the third degree of consanguinity or within the second degree of affinity. 
(b)  A candidate is subject to the state nepotism laws, including Texas Government Code Chapter 573, as presently enacted and hereafter amended. A candidate may not take an affirmative action to influence the following individuals regarding the appointment, reappointment, confirmation of the appointment or reappointment, employment, reemployment, change in status, compensation, or dismissal of another individual related to the candidate within the degrees described in subsection (a), above: 
(i)  An employee of the office to which the candidate seeks election; or 
(ii)  An employee or another officer of the governmental body to which the candidate seeks election, if the office the candidate seeks is one office of a multimember governmental body. 
A "candidate" for purposes of this ordinance is a person who knowingly and willingly takes affirmative action for the purpose of gaining nomination or election to public office or for the purpose of satisfying financial obligations incurred by the person in connection with the campaign for nomination or election. The prohibition provided herein does not apply to a candidate's actions taken regarding a bona fide class or category of employees or prospective employees. 
(c)  The nepotism prohibitions prescribed herein do not apply to an appointment, confirmation of an appointment, or vote for an appointment or confirmation of an appointment of an individual to a position if: 
(i)  The individual is employed in the position immediately before the election or appointment of the public official to whom the individual is related in a prohibited degree; and 
(ii)  That prior employment of the individual is continuous for at least thirty (30) days if the public official is appointed, or six (6) months if the public official is elected. 
However, if the individual continues in a position, the public official to whom the individual is related in a prohibited degree may not participate in any deliberation or voting on the appointment, reappointment, confirmation of the appointment or reappointment, employment, reemployment, change in status, compensation, or dismissal of the individual if that action applies only to the individual and is not taken regarding a bona fide class or category of employees.

    Before the city shall be liable to damage claim or suit for personal injury, or damage to property, the person who is injured or whose property is damaged or someone in his behalf shall give the city manager or the person performing the duties of city secretary, notice in writing duly verified, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of the alleged injury, or damage, stating specifically in such notice, when, where, by whom, and how the injury or damage was sustained, and stating the witnesses to the accident or injury and setting forth the extent of the injury or damages as accurately as possible.

This exception shall not apply to any existing structure with more than four residential units. All subcontractors, however, retained by an owner under this exception shall still be required to obtain a license and shall secure all other permits as applicable. This exception applies to existing residential property only and not to new construction regardless of ownership. Further, no exception shall apply on any commercial/industrial construction, wherein whoever acts as general contractor shall be required to obtain a contractor's license and all permits as applicable, regardless of ownership.

(1)  No license shall be issued to any person who does not file with the city a bond as listed below, conditioned upon the faithful compliance by the licensee and his employees with the provisions of this article. Such bond shall be either a cash bond or a surety bond payable to the city for the use and benefit of the city, the property owner, or any person damaged by any act or neglect of the principal or his agents or employees; or by reasons of failure to repair any defective work, material or installation; or for failure to remedy any defects or faulty workmanship or material within the time prescribed by the building official for the completion of such remedial work, without additional cost to the person for whom the work was done; and guaranteeing compliance with the requirements of this Code of all work installed by the principal, his agents, or employees. If a person fails to renew a bond payable to the city, the license shall be canceled.

Sec. 18-82. - Prohibited. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for the owner and/or occupant of any lot, tract, building, house, establishment or premises in the city to allow or permit carrion, filth, rubbish, brush, or any other unsightly, impure or unwholesome matter of any kind, or graffito or graffiti, to remain or accumulate thereon. 
(1)  The procedures for removal of graffiti on private premises shall be in compliance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 250.006, graffiti removal, as amended from time to time. 
(2)  The city council hereby authorizes the adoption of resolutions establishing fees, which may be amended from time to time, to recover expenses associated with the removal of graffiti from private properties in accordance with V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 250. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for the owner and/or occupant of any lot or other premises in the city to allow or permit holes or places where water may accumulate and become stagnant to be or remain on such lot or premises or to allow or permit the accumulation of stagnant water thereon, or to permit the same to remain thereon. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided herein, it shall be unlawful for the owner and/or occupant of any real property in the city to allow weeds and/or grasses that are 12 inches or more in height, as measured vertically from the natural surface from which the grass and/or weeds grow, to accumulate or remain on such real property or any portion thereof. 
(1)  Owners and/or occupants of real property zoned other than agriculture-open (AO) must obtain a city agricultural permit to use or lease out their property for agricultural crops and/or hay purposes. If the permit is approved by the city building official or designee, then 15 feet of the ground surface growth along all outer perimeter private property lines adjacent to properties not being used for agriculture and/or hay purposes must be kept mowed at a six-inch height or less, or kept disc plowed at all times to act as a firebreak. Failure to maintain the firebreak area creates a nuisance under this section and may void the permit. The city may pursue all legal remedies available, both civil and criminal, to remedy the failure to maintain the firebreak area. Storage of any hay bales must be in compliance with the current fire code and all local and state laws. A city agricultural permit is not required for: (i) real property zoned AO; however, all such AO zoned real property shall have a firebreak as described herein along any common property line where any adjacent property has any structures or wooden fences within 75 feet of said any common property lines; and (ii) domestic, but not commercial, gardens for the raising of vegetables, common domestic plants and flowers. 
(2)  After wildflowers have cast their seeds, but in no case later than August 1 of the calendar year, such wildflowers will be considered weeds and subject to the provisions of this section concerning weeds.

(d)  It shall be unlawful in residentially zoned districts to arrange, operate or maintain any yard lighting so that it illuminates portions of other properties, causing problems from glare or of a general nuisance nature. The intent of this subsection is that any lighting used to illuminate any yard, building, or structure in a residentially zoned district be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining properties, thus maximizing the illumination of any yard lighting onto the property where it originates and minimizing the illumination that pervades other properties. 
(e)  It shall be unlawful for the owner and/or occupant of any lot or premises in the city to allow or permit a junked vehicle as defined in V.T.C.A., Transportation Code § 683.071, as now enacted or hereafter amended, to remain on such lot or premises. A judicial determination of such status is not required for said owner and/or occupant to be in violation of this provision.

Fire Flow Calculations 
    The following information is a summary and is provided to assist in understanding the required fire flow calculation method. Refer to the Insurance Services Organization's (ISO) Fire Suppression Rating Schedule for actual calculations. Where any question or discrepancy exists Fire Suppression Rating Schedule should be followed. 
    The ISO's method for calculation of fire flows consider the square footage, type of construction, type of occupancy, exposure, and communication of the building to be protected. The required fire flow ("F") is determined as follows where: 
A = effective area 
C = construction coefficient* 
O = occupancy factor* 
E = exposure factor* 
M = communication factor* 
F = required flow 
F = 18(0)(E)(M)(C)(vA) 
The effective area is the sum of 100% of the ground floor and 50% of all additional floors. The final result is rounded to the nearest 250 gpm up to 2,500 gpm and to the nearest 500 gpm beyond 2,500 gpm. 
*See the ISO Fire Suppression Rating Schedule for details on calculation.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 22-26. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Lockhart are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2012-09, § I, 4-17-12) 
Sec. 22-27. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2012-09, § I, 4-17-12) 
Sec. 22-28. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development that may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2012-09, § I, 4-17-12) 
Sec. 22-29. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application: 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows, active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure that is on the same parcel of property as the principal to be insured, and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one percent annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) is the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-30, or VE, that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year - also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations. 
    Elevated building means for insurance purposes, a nonbasement building that has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings or columns.

(4)  Manufactured homes: 
a.  All manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot or more above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this subsection (4) shall be elevated so that either: (i) the lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot or more above the base flood elevation; or (ii) the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles: Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, or AE on the community's FIRM shall either: (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or (iii) meet the permit requirements of section 22-67, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4) of this section.

Sec. 22-99. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-31 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Because such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a.  Shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below one foot above the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below one foot above the base flood elevation in an AH zone, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads or the effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section are satisfied. 
(4)  Within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2012-09, § I, 4-17-12) 
Sec. 22-100. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-31 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first complies with all requirements of Section 65.12.

(c)  The historical preservation commission shall be guided by the expertise and wisdom of state and national organizations which evaluate, recognize, and support preservation of properties which have local, regional, state or national historical significance. Buildings, structures, objects, sites, areas or districts which are recognized as historically significant by the Texas Historical Commission, or by the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Register of Historic Places, shall be considered by the city council, in cooperation with the historical preservation commission, for designation as historic landmarks or historic districts. 
(d)  Upon designation of a building, object, site, structure or area as an historic landmark or historic district by the city council, the property shall have the proper historic (H) or historic landmark (HL) zoning designation added to any other use zoning designation established by the city zoning ordinances. The city council shall cause the designation, with suffix "H" or "HL," to be recorded on the official zoning maps of Lockhart. The existing use zoning designation, with the suffix "H" or "HL," shall indicate the zoning designation of those areas, sites, districts, landmarks, buildings or structures as being property designated as in an historic district or an historic landmark by the city. The city council shall also cause the city secretary to immediately file in the real property records of the office of county clerk of Caldwell County a verified written instrument identifying and listing each historic structure or property as designated historic district (H) or historic landmark (HL), and by: (i) the street address; (ii) the legal description of the real property on which the structure or property is located; and (iii) the name of the owner of the real property.

Sec. 28-9. - Building code relief for historic structures. 
(a)  All buildings, structures, objects and sites which are historic (H or HL), as designated by the city, shall be granted a measure of relief from compliance with the current building code, as may be amended or adopted from time to time, and with the Americans With Disabilities Act Plan adopted by the city.

Sec. 28-10. - Ordinary maintenance. 
(a)  The intent and purpose of this chapter is to encourage and assist the property owners to maintain, rehabilitate, enhance and preserve landmarks and districts. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance and repair of any interior or exterior architectural feature of an historic landmark or property within an historic district which does not involve a change in the architecture, design, finishes or outward overall appearance. 
(b)  Ordinary maintenance is considered necessary and generally refers to activities that would be considered customary or common for maintaining the property without a change of overall appearance. 
(c)  Ordinary maintenance is an activity which is generally unrestricted and is encouraged by this chapter. In-kind replacement or repair of any interior or exterior building element is included as ordinary maintenance. Interior repairs or construction which do not change the appearance or structure of the building are considered ordinary maintenance for the purposes of this chapter. This includes all activities which do not change the architecture, appearance, finishes or design of the building, structure or object as viewed from its exterior. 
(d)  Repainting shall be considered ordinary maintenance and may include a change in color of painted surfaces. 
(e)  Ordinary maintenance does not include the following and will require a certificate for alteration and a city building permit prior to beginning work, except as exempted in subsection 28-11(b): 
(1)  A physical change in exterior elements, design and finishes visible from grade level which affect the appearance and cohesiveness of a building, structure, site or area (e.g., a physical change in the design, finishes, size, shape, etc., of facades, windows, doors, light fixtures, awnings, signs, sidewalks, fences, steps, paving, etc.). 
(2)  Repainting or otherwise covering or altering a faded historic painted sign (ghost sign), even if the sign does not pertain to the current use of the building or is on a previously painted surface. 
(3)  Painting a previously unpainted surface (e.g., masonry wall, etc.). 
(Ord. No. 93-19, pt. 10, 9-21-93; Code 1982, § 12.5-10; Ord. No. 2010-16, § I, 6-15-10) 
Sec. 28-11. - Certificate for alteration for historic landmarks or historic districts.

(4)  Roofs. Replacement of existing roofing material with like or similar material and same design, slope and elevation is exempted. However, if the roof structure is clearly visible from a public street, replacement of existing roofing material with a different design, slope, elevation or material, such as replacing wood or slate roofing with metal roofing, does require a CFA approval by the commission, as provided in section 28-12. 
(5)  Utility installations on the rear and/or alley side of buildings which do not abut or are not clearly visible from a public street and do not alter, damage or obscure the architectural design, fabric (composition) or appearance, as provided in subsection 28-11(a) are exempted. Any such exempted utility work shall not involve the drilling, cutting, covering or painting of virgin or unpainted masonry or removal of same. 
(c)  A certificate for alteration (CFA) may be "pre-approved" for the following construction activities and work. Any qualifying activities and work pre-approved by the commission shall be listed and described in a "Pre-Approved Certificate for Alteration Guideline" developed by the commission, maintained and published by the city. An application for a CFA for any construction or activity that is determined "pre-approved" shall be made by the owner as provided in subsection 28-12(a) prior to conducting the work. The historical preservation officer (HPO) shall promptly review the application and determine if the construction or activity complies with the "pre-approved" criteria. The HPO has the authority to approve the CFA only for construction or activities, which qualify as "pre-approved". Any construction activity that qualifies as pre-approved as determined by the HPO does not require any further approval of the commission, but may proceed according to normal city policies and procedures. After acceptance and approval of a "pre-approved" CFA, the HPO shall place the pre-approved CFA on the next agenda of the commission for discussion. Any "pre-approved" construction or activity shall not involve the drilling, cutting, covering or painting of virgin or unpainted masonry or removal of same. Types of alterations included in the Pre-Approved Certificate for Alteration Guideline follow: 
(1)  Signs as provided for in "Pre-Approved Certificate for Alteration Guideline", signs that do not alter, damage or obscure a building's architectural design, historic fabric or appearance as otherwise provided in subsection 28-11(a) are "pre-approved".

(2)  Window replacement may be "pre-approved" only as provided in the "Pre-Approved Certificate for Alteration Guideline". Generally, the replacement of existing windows with historically appropriate designed painted wood single or 2-over-2 divided-light windows matched to the size of the historic window openings may be "pre-approved". Any other type of window replacement or closure of windows requires CFA approval by the commission as provided in section 28-12. 
(3)  Door replacement may be "pre-approved" only as provided in "Pre-Approved Certificate for Alteration Guideline". Generally, the replacement of an existing front entry door with a historically appropriate designed wood door is "pre-approved".

Any other type of entry door replacement requires CFA approval by the commission as provided in section 28-12. 
(4)  Awnings and suspended canopies that do not alter, damage or obscure the architectural design, fabric (composition) or appearance as provided in subsection 28-11(a) may be "pre-approved" only as provided in "Pre-Approved Certificate for Alteration Guideline". Generally, a new awning or canopy or the replacement of an awning or canopy qualifies as "pre-approved" when constructed of an aluminum framework with a flame-retardant canvas covering or light-gauge metal tubing with standing seam metal roofing, installed without drilling or alteration to the existing formed masonry (e.g., brick). All CFA applications shall include a detailed design and attachment plan sealed by a professional engineer describing and attesting to all means of attachment and alteration to the building, masonry wall and/or surface. Any other type of new or replacement awning or canopy requires CFA approval by the commission as provided in section 28-12. 
(5)  Exterior fire-safety stairs constructed to meet city codes which do not alter or damage the architectural design, fabric (composition) or appearance as provided in subsection 28-11(a), may be "pre-approved" if located on the rear or nonstreet side of a building. The owner, designer and/or contractor are encouraged to meet with the Lockhart Historical Preservation Commission to discuss alternatives in location, placement and design prior to requesting an opinion or directive from the city fire marshal. Installation of exterior fire-safety stairs shall not alter or damage the architectural design, fabric (composition) or appearance as provided in subsection 28-11(a). 
(d)  A certificate for alteration is not required for banners suspended over streets and temporary signs on public rights-of-way or public property advertising noncommercial special events and festivities as provided in chapter 46, subsection 46-7(15), and for banner signs on private property as provided in chapter 46, subsection 46-10(g). 
(e)  The commission and historical preservation officer shall process each application for a certificate for alteration as expeditiously as possible. 
(f)  Special considerations and provisions shall be made for emergency repair of sudden, accidental, and unforeseen damage to buildings by acts of God or man which shall endanger a building, business, owner or the public. Immediate temporary repair of damage shall be encouraged with only notification of the historical preservation officer that such work is taking place. If a certificate for alteration is required for permanent repairs of damage which will change the exterior appearance of the building or structure, a special rapid review and approval may be requested. The historical preservation officer shall immediately contact the commission chairman for action. 
(g)  Special consideration and provisions shall be made for temporary alteration of the appearance of historic landmarks or property located in an historic district for a special event or occurrence (e.g., a movie, fundraiser, etc.). The commission may grant one certificate for alteration to the responsible organization to approve all of the temporary work anticipated, conditional upon the organization returning the property to its original condition. The commission shall require photographic documentation of existing conditions prior to issuance of the certificate for (temporary) alteration. An individual "permanent" certificate for alteration is required for each property which wishes to retain the "temporary" alterations after the special event. 
(h)  The commission and/or the historical preservation officer shall not unreasonably withhold any certificate for alteration. 
(i)  A certificate for alteration shall be obtained prior to the issuance of a city building permit, if such permit is required. A certificate shall not be issued in lieu of a required city building permit. Approval and issuance of a certificate for alteration by the commission qualifies as "other zoning action required to effect the issuance of a city building permit" as specified in the Lockhart Code, subsection 64-126(b)(3), or as may be hereafter amended.

Sec. 28-13. - Criteria for approval of certificate for alteration. 
    In considering an application for a certificate for alteration, the commission shall be guided by the design criteria and guidelines developed by the commission and adopted by the city council. The criteria and guidelines shall be adopted forthwith and shall follow, where applicable, "The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings," as revised 1990, or as may be hereafter amended. The design guidelines adopted by the council and the "Secretary of the Interior's Standards" shall be made available to the property owners of historic landmarks or within historic districts. If requested, the commission and/or the historical preservation officer shall assist property owners with advice, guidance, resource lists and other information regarding construction techniques, materials, means and methods which are acceptable and recommended for the construction included in the proposed certificate for alteration. The following shall be the minimum criteria for approval: 
(1)  The predominate criteria for approval of a certificate for alteration shall be to support proposed construction activities which will enhance an area, site, building, structure or object which is zoned historic, and thereby encourage continued maintenance and preservation of historical buildings, structures, objects and sites. 
(2)  Contemporary design for alterations and new additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material; or such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, finishes and character of the property, neighborhood, or environment. 
(3)  Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to buildings, structures, objects, or sites shall be done in such a manner that, if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original building, structure, object, or site would be unimpaired. 
(4)  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, object or site and its environment. These changes may or may not have acquired significance in their own right. If these changes have acquired significance in their own right, this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
(5)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to adapt the property in a manner which requires minimal alteration of the basic building, structure, object or site and its environment. 
(6)  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, object or site and its environment should not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material, finish or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
(7)  Distinctive stylistic features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure, object or site should be kept and preserved, where possible. 
(8)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should reflect the material being replaced in composition, design, finish, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
(9)  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. Painting of original unfinished masonry surfaces shall be discouraged. 
(10)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
(11)  The owner of property for which a city building permit is issued shall be responsible for maintaining a safe construction and/or demolition site at all times by providing proper barricades, signage, walkways, erosion control, etc., and following all structural and safety recommendations and requirements of city, state, and federal governmental agencies.

(d)  After emergency measures are undertaken, the historical preservation officer shall meet with the municipal officials wishing to issue the order for demolition to review the condition of the structure and the development of plans for the rehabilitation. If after one month no feasible scheme for the further protection of the structure has been developed, the commission shall make a recommendation for an order for demolition.

(Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 1-15-02) 
Sec. 31-14. - Refunds. 
(a)  Upon application, any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to these regulations, which has not been expended within the service area within ten years from the date of payment, shall be refunded to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid or, if the impact fee was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in chapter 1.03, title 79, Revised Statutes (chapter 5069-1.03, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), or its successor statute. The application for refund pursuant to this section shall be submitted within 60 days after the expiration of the ten-year period for expenditure of the fee. An impact fee shall be considered expended on a first-in, first out basis. 
(b)  An impact fee collected pursuant to these regulations shall also be considered expended if the total expenditures for capital improvements or facility expansion authorized in section 31-12 within the service area within ten years following the date of payment exceeds the total fees collected within the service area for such improvements or expansions during such period. 
(c)  Upon application, any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to these regulations shall be refunded if: 
(1)  Existing service is available and service is denied; 
(2)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and the city has failed to commence construction of facilities to provide service within two years of fee payment; or 
(3)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and has not subsequently been made available within a reasonable period of time considering the type of capital improvement or facility expansion to be constructed, but in any event later than five years from the date of fee payment. 
(d)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a), (b) or (c), the city shall divide the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 1-15-02) 
Sec. 31-15. - Rebates. 
(a)  If a tract of land for which an impact fee has been paid is replatted, resulting in a reduction in the number of service units, and the new impact fee to be collected is less than that paid, the city shall rebate the difference, provided that water meters to serve the development have not been installed. 
(b)  If the building permit for a new development for which an impact fee has been paid has expired, no tap purchases for that category of capital improvements have been made to the development, and a modified or new application has not been filed within six months of such expiration, the city shall, upon written application, rebate the amount of the impact fee to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid. If no application for rebate pursuant to this subsection has been filed within this period, no rebate shall become due. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 1-15-02) 
Sec. 31-16. - Updates to plans and revision of fees. 
(a)  The city shall update its land use assumptions and capital improvements plans at least every five years, commencing from the date of adoption of such plans, and shall recalculate the impact fees based thereon in accordance with the procedures set forth in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 395, or in any successor statute. 
(b)  The city may review its land use assumptions, impact fees, capital improvements plans and other factors such as market conditions more frequently than provided in subsection (a) to determine whether the land use assumptions and capital improvements plans should be updated and the impact fee recalculated accordingly, or whether schedules 1 or 2 should be changed. Schedule 2 may be amended without revising land use assumptions and capital improvements plans at any time prior to the update provided for in subsection (a), provided that the impact fees to be collected under schedule 2 do not exceed the impact fees assessed under schedule 1. 
(c)  If, at the time an update is required pursuant to subsection (a), the city council determines that no change to the land use assumptions, capital improvements plan or impact fee is needed, it may dispense with such update by following the procedures in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 395.0575. 
(d)  The city may amend by resolution table 1 or table 2 at any time prior to the update provided for in subsection (a), provided that the number of service units associated with a particular use shall not be increased.

Sec. 31-18. - Agreement for capital improvements. 
(a)  An owner of a new development may construct or finance a capital improvement or facility expansion designated in the impact fee capital improvements plan, if required or authorized by the city, by entering into an agreement with the city prior to the issuance of any building permit for the development. The agreement shall identify the estimated cost of the improvement or expansion, the schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement or expansion, a requirement that the improvement be designed and completed to city standards and such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the city. The agreement shall provide for the method to be used to determine the amount of the offset or credit to be given against impact fees due for the development. 
(b)  The city and such owner either may agree that the costs incurred or funds advanced will be offset or credited against the impact fees otherwise due from the new development, or they may agree that the city shall reimburse the owner for such costs from impact fees paid from other new developments which will use such capital improvements or facility expansions, or from other funding sources. In the event that the city elects to reimburse an owner for the dedication, construction or financing of a capital improvement or facility expansion designated in the capital improvements plan, the terms of reimbursement shall be incorporated in the agreement required by subsection (a). Reimbursement agreements shall further be based on the availability of city funds from all sources including current and projected impact fee fund accounts. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 1-15-02) 
Sec. 31-19. - Exceptions. 
(a)  To encourage affordable housing, 80 percent of all impact fees shall be waived or refunded based upon the prospective owner's total recurring household income, as set forth below: 
(1)  Where the city has applied for and received a state or federal housing infrastructure grant for the purpose of supporting low and moderate income housing, 80 percent of the impact fees shall be waived at the normal time of collection of such fees for lots in a subdivision that are developed and occupied in accordance with grant requirements. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for a dwelling until either of the following is submitted to the city: 
a.  A written application and proof of the prospective homeowner's qualification for low and moderate income housing, as defined by the infrastructure grant program requirements; or 
b.  Payment of the remaining 80 percent of all impact fees. 
(2)  For lots or parcels that are not located in a subdivision receiving a state or federal housing infrastructure grant, the prospective owner of a new single-family dwelling may submit a written application and qualifying documentation of an annual income of 80 percent or less of the median household income for Caldwell County for the purpose of obtaining a reduction in impact fees in accordance with the following: 
a.  When the owner's household income is documented at the normal time of collection of impact fees, 80 percent of the impact fees shall be waived, resulting in a payment of 20 percent of the total amount. 
b.  When the owner is not known at the normal time of collection of impact fees, the full amount of all impact fees shall be paid. If the owner's household is later determined to meet the eligibility requirements, 80 percent of the amount of impact fees already paid shall be refunded directly to the homeowner, regardless of who originally paid the fees. If there is a mortgage closing, the refund shall be paid at any time before the closing date. If there is no mortgage closing, the refund shall be paid after issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the new dwelling. 
(b)  Impact fees charged for new construction or building additions on lots for which a building permit is submitted before October 1, 2017, or on lots shown on a development plat or final plat approved, before October 1, 2017, and for which a building permit is submitted before October 1, 2019, shall be the amount in appendix I, Schedule 2, as adopted by Ordinance 07-11, subject to any other applicable exceptions in this section. 
(c)  No water or wastewater impact fee shall be charged for a water meter on a line used exclusively for emergency fire suppression. 
(d)  No wastewater impact fee shall be charged for a water meter on a line used exclusively for landscape irrigation. 
(e)  To encourage infill development of vacant parcels in the older residential subdivisions, no impact fees shall be charged for construction of new single-family or duplex dwellings on property in the original Town of Lockhart as recorded in 1875 in Volume Q, Page 507, Caldwell County Deed Records, or on lots in subsequent named subdivisions recorded prior to January 1, 1970, that have frontage on an adequate paved street, and that have existing direct access to water and wastewater utilities without requiring off-site extensions or improvements.

Such fee is intended to be consistent with and to further the policies of city's comprehensive land use plan, the capital improvements plan, the zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations and other city policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the city seeks to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities in conjunction with the development of land. 
(b)  This chapter shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density of development, design, and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of public improvements subject to the zoning and subdivision regulations or other regulations of the city, which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development.

Sec. 31-22. - Relief procedures.

The petition shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the unperformed duty and request that the duty be performed within 60 days of the request. If the city council determines that the duty is required pursuant to the ordinance and is late in being performed, it shall cause the duty to commence within 60 days of the date of the request and to continue until completion. This subsection is not applicable to matters which may be appealed pursuant to section 31-13. 
(b)  The city council may grant a variance from any requirement of this chapter, upon written request by a developer or owner of property subject to the ordinance, following a public hearing, and only upon finding that a strict application of such requirement would, when regarded as a whole, result in confiscation of the property. 
(c)  If the city council grants a variance to the amount of the impact fee due for a new development under this section, it may cause to be appropriated from other city funds the amount of the reduction in the impact fee to the account for the service area in which the property is located.

A firearm shall include specifically, but not exclusively, any shot gun, pistol, rifle, air rifle, B.B. gun, bow and arrow, and any other mechanism that discharges or ejects any bullet, buckshot, or any other metallic object of any size by force of combustion, mechanism, or air.

a.  Except as provided in subsection b. below, shooting a shotgun or firearm as defined by this section upon a tract of ten acres or more under one ownership, with the effective consent of the owner(s) and any tenant(s) residing thereon, and not adjacent to any developed area, provided that the shot gun is not discharged in such a manner or would reasonably be expected to cause any projectile to cross the boundary of the tract onto other premises. Except as provided herein, the discharge of shotguns is restricted to 300 feet from property belonging to another owner where there is a developed area and discharge is restricted to tracts of land ten acres or more that are not zoned residential.

Except as provided herein, the discharge of center fire or rim fire rifles is restricted to 300 feet from property belonging to another owner where there is a developed area and discharge is restricted to tracts of land 50 acres or more that are not zoned residential.

(2)  The chief of police or his delegate may deny the granting of an application where he believes that there has been or will be a failure to comply with the intent of this section. The application shall be approved or denied within five days of being properly submitted which allows for sufficient time to check subdivision development and zoning for the subject track(s) and adjacent tracts. In the event that an application is denied, applicant shall have the right to appeal to the city council and receive a hearing at the next available city council meeting where the item may be posted according to the requisites of the Texas Open Meetings Act.

(1)  Permit application. Anyone wishing to operate an indoor shooting range within the city limits shall file a written application to the city building official on a form provided by the city. All sections of the form must be completed and attachments to the form shall include: 
a.  Plans and specifications of the real property and improvements where the indoor shooting range will be located, with plans drawn to scale showing the location and dimensions of all equipment and improvements existing and to be constructed, and showing the locations and dimensions of proposed firing lines and target areas, and the location, design and materials for the construction of backstops, baffles, walls and ceilings downrange and at the firing line.

(2)  Permit issuance. The city building official shall review the properly completed indoor shooting range application.

Each permit shall recite that the issuance thereof does not constitute any assurance by the City of Lockhart, Texas, its officers, employees and/or agents, that injury (including death) and/or property damage may not result from the operation or use of the approved shooting range. 
(3)  Right of appeal. A shooting range permit applicant aggrieved by a decision of the building official may appeal that decision to the city council by filing written notice of the appeal, with specific allegations of the building official's error, with the city secretary. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the action or determination of the building official which was appealed.

(Ord. No. 06-11, § II, 2-21-06) 
Sec. 50-162. - Driveway access permit. 
(a)  Except as exempted in subsection 50-162(b), no person shall construct, reconstruct, repair or alter any driveway approach, or cut, alter, or repair any curb, within the Lockhart city limits in a manner that is subject to the standards of this article without first obtaining a driveway permit or temporary driveway permit for said construction, reconstruction, repair, alteration or cut from the city. Modification of an existing driveway or construction of a new driveway may be required for compliance with this article due to development of vacant property, modification of existing buildings, construction of new buildings, or a change in land use where submission of a site plan is required. 
(b)  An application for a driveway access permit or temporary driveway access permit shall be in a form acceptable to the city. In addition to any information expressly required of an applicant for such an application by this article, the city may require an applicant to provide such other information as shall be reasonably necessary for the administration and enforcement of this article such as a traffic impact study. A separate application and permit may be waived for driveways not on state highways if the driveway access is associated with development of property requiring a building permit, and provided all required driveway information is presented on a site plan or other supplement. 
(c)  A fee schedule may be established by resolution of the city council for driveway access permits and temporary driveway access permits. 
(d)  A driveway access permit shall expire six months from the date of issuance. One six-month extension may be approved upon written request by the applicant prior to the original expiration date. 
(e)  No driveway opening onto a state highway will be permitted unless the driveway complies with the Texas Department of Transportation Access Management Manual and Regulations for Access Driveways to State Highways. Driveway openings onto state highways must address driveway geometrics, utility location or relocation considerations, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Texas Accessibility Standards (TAS), environmental regulations, wetland considerations if appropriate, and all other applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations to the satisfaction of the Texas Department of Transportation. 
(f)  Where drainage conditions warrant, the property owner is responsible for the engineering design of all drainage structures as deemed necessary by the city, to accommodate the proposed driveway approach. 
(g)  No driveway access permit shall be issued until the city has approved a site plan. A site plan submitted for a building permit may also serve as the site plan for the driveway access permit if all required elements are included. Site plans shall include the following: 
(1)  Dimensions and location of driveway being requested, and any other existing or proposed driveway on the site; 
(2)  Driveway surface type; 
(3)  All existing and proposed drainage structures; 
(4)  Signs, utility poles, water meters, fire hydrants, and surface electrical transformers; 
(5)  Building footprint(s), labeled by land use type; 
(6)  Service fixtures such as mailboxes, gasoline pumps, and drive-through windows; 
(7)  A parking plan showing all parking spaces, curbs, tire stops, radius dimensions, and internal circulation pattern; 
(8)  Distance to nearest driveway on same property and on the same street, if any; 
(9)  Distance to nearest driveway on adjacent property and on the same street, if any; 
(10)  On corner lots, undisturbed distance from the driveway curb return to the street intersection curb return; 
(11)  Off-set distance to nearest driveway on opposite side of the street, if any; 
(12)  Names and telephone numbers of all responsible parties; and, 
(13)  If requested by the city, vertical and horizontal stopping-sight distance calculations. 
(h)  On property other than residential, shared driveway access and internal access connections between adjacent properties are encouraged in those instances where the adjoining properties are compatible in terms of land use and traffic characteristics, and where environmental or terrain constraints do not preclude the provision of such internal site access. The city may, at its discretion, determine cases where shared driveways are not attainable or feasible. The express intent of encouraging shared driveways and common internal site access is to minimize in number and location the total number of driveway access points along the adjacent roadway in order to provide for safe and efficient movement of vehicles. A private access easement and/or shared access agreement between adjacent owners shall be provided when applicable. 
(i)  If the site plan is part of a building construction plan requiring a building permit, the driveways contained on the site plan or construction plans for public infrastructure accompanying the site plan shall contain sufficient detail for construction. If the site plan is not a part of a building construction plan requiring a building permit, the driveways contained on the site plan shall contain sufficient detail for construction. 
(j)  Parking shall comply with regulations of the Zoning Ordinance and all other applicable city regulations. If a parking area is accessed from a state highway, compliance with the Texas Department of Transportation Access Management Manual is also required. 
(k)  No driveway access will be permitted without sufficient available vertical and horizontal sight distance as outlined in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Policy (1990) on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, and subsequent amendments and versions thereof. No driveway access will be permitted to encompass, encroach upon, or interfere with municipal or utility facilities such as street signs, street light poles, traffic signal standards, utility poles, drainage structures, crosswalks, bus stop areas, fire hydrants, water meters, electrical transformers, or other necessary public infrastructure. The relocation of such facilities, if necessary to accommodate a driveway location or configuration that is otherwise in compliance with this article, may be authorized by the city and such relocations will be made at the applicant's expense.

ARTICLE II. - PROCEDURE 

Sec. 52-31. - Plat required. 
(a)  Subdivision plat. The owner of a tract of land located within the city limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction who creates a subdivision, as defined in this chapter, shall prepare and submit a subdivision plat to the city for approval and recording according to the procedures and requirements of this chapter. No owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision shall sell or convey any land by reference to, exhibition of, or by the use of a plan or plat of a subdivision, nor shall a building permit be issued for or utility service be provided to any development on a tract of land requiring a recordable plat, before such plat is filed for record with the county clerk. The conveyance of real property included within the subdivision shall be by lot and block. A subdivision plat is not required for the division or assembly of tracts of land into parts greater than five acres within the city limits, or greater than ten acres in the extraterritorial jurisdiction, where each part has access and no public improvement is being dedicated. For the purposes of this section, "access" means abutting an improved public street right-of-way along at least one property line for at least 25 feet. For the purposes of this section, "public improvement" means a right-of-way or easement, or other land, dedicated to and accepted by a taxing entity or public utility company for infrastructure or other public uses. 
(b)  Development plat. The owner of a tract of land located within the city limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction who proposes to construct a new building or structural addition exceeding 50 percent of the floor area of an existing building on a tract that is not part of a recorded subdivision, and where no subdivision plat is required, shall prepare and submit a development plat to the city for approval according to the procedures for preliminary plats. No owner or agent of the owner of a tract of land shall undertake any construction, nor shall a building permit be issued for or utility service be provided to any development on a tract of land requiring a development plat, before such plat is approved in accordance with this chapter. A development plat is not required for: 
(1)  The construction or expansion of one single-family or duplex dwelling, or the installation of one manufactured home, on the tract. 
(2)  The construction of buildings not intended for human occupancy and as an accessory to any existing use provided such structures are in conformance with all other applicable city regulations. 
(3)  The construction of buildings for storage of equipment, materials, or harvested products, or for the shelter of animals, where the sole use of the property is for agricultural purposes.

(2)  Approve the preliminary plat and/or variances with modifications. 
(f)  Within ten days of the commission's decision, the city shall issue to the applicant a certificate stating the date that the preliminary plat was approved, approved with modifications, or denied, and state the reasons for denial, if applicable. 
(g)  If the commission disapproves, or approves with modification, the preliminary plat and/or variances, the applicant may elect one of the following: 
(1)  In the case of disapproval, make any changes necessary to address the commission's reason for denial, resubmit the plat to the city planner with revisions for review and reconsideration by the commission in accordance with the same procedural requirements as for the original submission. If a revised preliminary plat is not resubmitted within 90 days of the commission's denial, it shall be considered withdrawn. 
(2)  In the case of approval with modification, make the changes requested by the commission and provide the city planner with two revised copies of the preliminary plat. If the revised copies are not resubmitted within 90 days of the commission's approval, the preliminary plat shall be considered withdrawn.

(2)  Upon approval, or approval with modifications, of the subdivision development plan and preliminary plat by the commission, a final plat for that portion to be immediately developed shall be submitted in accordance with this chapter. Additional phases conforming with the approved subdivision development plan may then be platted sequentially in accordance with the requirements for preliminary and final plats. No changes to the subdivision development plan shall be made without approval of the commission. 
(3)  The first phase subdivided shall be labeled "Section One" following the name of the subdivision, with subsequent phases numbered sequentially thereafter. 
(Code 1982, § 23-2-3; Ord. No. 87-07, pt. 2, 4-28-87; Ord. No. 97-03, § VII(23-2-4), 3-4-97; Ord. No. 05-02, § II, 2-15-05; Ord. No. 2009-17, § I, 5-19-09)

Two additional copies of the engineering plans shall be submitted to the city engineer. Upon receipt of staff comments, the applicant shall make any requested corrections or other changes and submit 12 prints of the revised plat (two prints of revised minor plats) and engineering plans to the city planner. The plat shall be considered "filed" with the city on the date that the revisions are submitted along with the application fee as provided herein. The revised plat will be accepted only if the engineering plans, if any, have been approved by the city engineer. In addition, if the subdivision involves improvements that are subject to a FEMA letter of map revision (LOMR), the approved conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) shall be provided to the city prior to acceptance of the plat. All plat prints shall be prefolded to a size no larger than nine inches by 12 inches at the time of submittal. If no preliminary plat was required and one or more variances are desired, they shall be requested concurrent with the final plat application. 
(b)  Within 30 days after the final plat is filed with the city planner, the commission shall approve or disapprove the plat and variance(s), if any. Within ten days of the commission's decision, the city shall issue to the applicant a certificate stating the date that the final plat was approved or denied, and state the reasons for denial, if applicable. If the plat complies with all standards and requirements of this chapter, it shall be approved. A final plat that is denied may be resubmitted as a continuance of the same application if the necessary changes are made to address the reasons for the commission's denial. If a revised final plat is not resubmitted within 90 days of the commission's denial, it shall be considered withdrawn. 
(c)  After approval of the final plat, the applicant shall submit a set of digital drawing files of the plat on compact disc or flash drive, or by e-mail or cloud storage, in a PDF format, and as a DXF, DWG, or ESRI shape file projected within the parameters of the Texas State Plane Coordinate System, South Central Zone, NAD 83, in survey feet, and shall also submit two coated, non-smearing Vellum or Mylar reproducible sets of the plat containing the notarized signature of the owner(s), and the signatures and seals of the surveyor and engineer, as applicable. The chairman of the commission, or designee, will sign the approval certificate on the reproducible sets. In the case of amending plats and minor plats not requiring a variance, the city manager will sign the approval certificate. The city planner shall cause the final plat to be recorded with the county clerk within five days after acceptance by the city of all improvements, as provided in section 52-202, and upon receipt of the items listed in section 52-204. After recording, one reproducible set shall be retained by the city planner. 
(d)  Changes made to a final plat subsequent to being recorded and not eligible for an amending plat as set forth in section 52-39, shall be submitted as a replat in accordance with section 52-38. Other corrections or changes made to a final plat subsequent to being recorded, shall be submitted as an amending plat in accordance with section 52-39. Upon approval of the replat or amending plat, it shall be recorded with the county clerk, who shall mark the previously recorded plat as "void". 
(e)  Construction by the applicant of any required public improvements shall commence within 12 months of the commission's approval of a final plat.

(a)  A replat is a recordable plat other than a minor replat as provided in section 52-36 that does not require prior approval of a preliminary plat and is prepared and processed in accordance with the requirements for final plats as specified in section 52-35, subject to additional public hearing requirements, if applicable, as set forth in this section. A replat of a subdivision or part of a subdivision may be recorded and is controlling over the preceding plat without vacation of that plat if the replat: 
(1)  Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being replatted; 
(2)  Is approved by the commission, after public hearings at which parties in interest and citizens have an opportunity to be heard; and 
(3)  Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions. 
(b)  If during the preceding five years, any of the area to be replatted without vacation of the preceding plat was limited by zoning classification or deed restrictions to residential use for not more than two units per lot, then notice of the public hearing required in subsection (a) shall be given before the 15th day before the date of the hearing by: 
(1)  Publication in the city's official newspaper/publication of record; and 
(2)  Written notice by mail, with a copy of subsection (c) of this section attached, to the owners of lots that are in the original subdivision and that are within 200 feet of the lots to be replatted, as indicated on the most recently approved city tax roll or, in the case of a subdivision within the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the most recently approved county tax roll of the property upon which the replat is requested. 
(c)  If the proposed plat requires a variance and is protested in accordance with this subsection, the proposed plat must receive, in order to be approved, the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the members of the commission present. For a legal protest, written instruments signed by the owners of at least 20 percent of the area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed replat and extending 200 feet from that area, but within the original subdivision, must be filed with the commission prior to the close of the public hearing. In computing the percentage of land under this subsection, the area of streets and alleys shall be included. Compliance with the subsection is not required if the area to be replatted was designated or reserved for other than single-family or duplex-family residential by notation on the last legally recorded plat or in the legally recorded restrictions applicable to the plat.

(1)  To correct an error in a course or distance shown on the preceding plat; 
(2)  To add a course or distance that was omitted on the preceding plat; 
(3)  To correct an error in a real property description shown on the preceding plat; 
(4)  To indicate monuments set after the death, disability, or retirement from practice of the surveyor responsible for setting monuments; 
(5)  To show the location or character of a monument that has been changed in location or that is shown incorrectly as to location or character on the preceding plat; 
(6)  To correct any other type of scrivener or clerical error or omission previously approved by the city including lot numbers, acreage, street names and identification of adjacent recorded plats; 
(7)  To correct an error in courses and distances of lot lines between two adjacent lots if: 
a.  Both lot owners join in the application for amending the plat; 
b.  Neither lot is abolished; 
c.  The amendment does not attempt to remove recorded covenants or restrictions; and

a.  The owners of all those lots join in the application for amending the plat; 
b.  The amendment does not attempt to remove recorded covenants or restrictions; 
c.  The amendment does not increase the number of lots; and 
d.  The amendment does not create or require the creation of a new street or make necessary the extension of municipal facilities. 
(b)  Notice, a hearing, and the approval of other lot owners are not required by the approval and issuance of an amending plat. 
(c)  Amending plats shall be presented to the city manager or the city manager's designee for approval. If, for any reason, the city manager or designee does not wish to approve the plat, it shall be presented to the commission for approval or denial in accordance with the procedures for final plats in section 52-35, within three weeks of the city manager's denial. If a variance is requested by the applicant, the amending plat must be referred to the commission for approval or denial of both the variance and the plat.

Sec. 52-40. - Procedure for approval of development plat. 
(a)  Development plats for which it is determined that no land dedications or construction of public improvements is required, may be approved administratively by the city planner. A building permit shall not be issued for the development prior to endorsement of the city planner's approval on the plat. 
(b)  Development plats requiring the construction of public sidewalks, streets, or alleys, and/or the dedication of land or easements to accommodate such facilities as required to comply with city standards, shall be prepared and processed in accordance with the requirements for final plats as specified in section 52-35 provided, however, that when there is no dedication of land or easements, or where the applicant chooses to dedicate such easements by separate instrument instead of on the plat, recording of the development plat with the county clerk is not required. A building permit shall not be issued for the development prior to approval of the development plat by the commission. The development shall not pass final inspection or receive a certificate of occupancy until any required construction of public facilities is completed and accepted by the city, and any required dedications are recorded with the county clerk on the development plat or by separate instrument. 
(c)  A development plat is eligible for approval by either the city planner or commission, as applicable, only when it is consistent with the adopted plans and ordinances of the city. If a variance is requested by the applicant, the development plat must be referred to the commission for approval or denial of both the variance and the plat.

Sec. 52-41. - Application fees. 
    Application fees for preliminary plats and all recordable plats, shall be as established by separate resolution of the city council. Such fees, which are collected for the purpose of defraying the costs administrative, clerical and inspection services necessary to implement this chapter, shall be collected by the city at the time the plat is submitted. No action by the city shall be valid unless and until the required fees have been paid to the city. 
(Ord. No. 97-03, § XII(23-2-11), 3-4-97; Ord. No. 02-15, § I, 4-2-02; Ord. No. 03-21, § I, 9-2-03; Ord. No. 05-02, § II, 2-15-05; Ord. No. 2009-17, § I, 5-19-09) 
Sec. 52-42. - Dedication and construction of public infrastructure. 
(a)  The approval of a plat is not considered an acceptance of any proposed dedication and does not impose on the city any duty regarding the maintenance or improvement of any dedicated parts until the city accepts the required improvements in accordance with section 52-202, or until the plat is recorded. 
(b)  To ensure that it will not incur liabilities, the city may require, before it gives approval of the engineering plans for a development, that the owner provide sufficient surety and warranty to guarantee that claims against the development will be satisfied if a default or construction failure occurs. A nonrevocable bond in the amount of ten percent of the total construction cost shall continue in force until the one-year warranty of construction has expired. This subsection does not preclude a claimant from seeking recovery by other means. 
(c)  The disapproval of a plat is considered a refusal by the city of the offered dedication indicated on the plat.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 06-07, § III, adopted Feb. 7, 2006, renamed the title of art. III to read as herein set out. Formerly, said art. pertained to similar subject matter. 

Sec. 52-71. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 06-07, § III, adopted Feb. 7, 2006, repealed § 52-71 in its entirety. Formerly, said section pertained to general standards as enacted by Code 1982, § 23-3-1; as amended. 
Sec. 52-72. - Streets. 
(a)  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the thoroughfare plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
(b)  When a street is not on the thoroughfare plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall provide for the continuation of existing streets in surrounding areas. If there are no streets existing on adjacent vacant and unsubdivided land, the arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall make provision for the proper extension of streets into such area. The length of any dead end street projections intended for future extension beyond the limits of the subdivision shall not exceed the depth of one lot unless a cul-de-sac is constructed no further than one lot from the subdivision perimeter. Consideration shall be given to efficient internal distribution of traffic by maximizing connectivity with multiple streets and intersections in a grid pattern or similar arrangement of blocks. 
(c)  All subdivisions with a potential to serve more than 100 dwelling units, or more than 25 nonresidential lots, shall have at least two points of vehicular access consisting of improved streets connected to the city's thoroughfare system; or, a single entrance street divided by a median where the median extends to the nearest internal street which provides at least two routes to the interior of the subdivision. Residential driveways shall not be located on the sides of the divided street parallel to and within the length of an entrance median. 
(d)  Where a subdivision adjoins or contains an existing or proposed major road, arterial street, or collector street, the commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection to residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. No side lot access to residential corner lots shall be allowed from any arterial street. 
(e)  Where the proposed subdivision abuts upon an existing street that does not conform to the thoroughfare plan, the subdivider shall dedicate one-half of the right-of-way sufficient to make the ultimate full right-of-way width conform.

(g)  Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided. 
(h)  Arterial street intersections shall be at 90-degree angles. Other street intersections shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect at less than 75 degrees nor more than 105 degrees. 
(i)  Street right-of-way and pavement widths shall be as shown on the thoroughfare plan and, where not shown therein, shall be not less than as follows: 
(1)  Arterial streets: Minimum right-of-way width 80 feet to a maximum of 140 feet, with the pavement width section to be based on standard details for the specific street class, depending upon the location and existing streets with which said street is to be connected. 
(2)  Collector streets: Right-of-way width 60 feet, and pavement width of 41 feet back-to-back of curb. The right-of-way width may be required to be wider or supplemented with abutting easements where all utilities are to be located in the front of lots. 
(3)  Minor streets: 
a.  Residential street: Right-of-way width 50 feet, and pavement width of 31 feet back-to-back of curb. The right-of-way width shall be wider or supplemented with abutting easements where all utilities are to be located in the front of lots. 
b.  Local street in multifamily, commercial or industrial areas: Right-of-way width 60 feet, with pavement width section as identified in standard details or greater if required for drainage. The right-of-way may be required to be wider or supplemented with abutting easements where all utilities are to be located in the front of lots. 
(j)  Half-width streets shall be prohibited. 
(k)  A cul-de-sac shall not be longer than 500 feet measured from the connecting street centerline to center radius point of the closed end having a paved street turnaround diameter of at least 80 feet with a right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet for residential, and at least 180-foot paved street turnaround diameter with a 200-foot right-of-way diameter in commercial and industrial areas. Center islands may be provided subject to approval by the city. 
(l)  Traffic circles (roundabouts) are encouraged in appropriate locations and may be used in accordance with the following conditions: 
(1)  The design shall be in accordance with Chapter 6 "Geometric Design" of Federal Highway Administration Publication No. FHWA-RD-00-067 "Roundabouts: An Informational Guide", as applicable to the type, width and design speeds of intersecting streets. 
(2)  Pavement markings, "Traffic Circle Ahead" or international graphic circular intersection signs, "Yield" signs and "One-Way" signs pointing to the right shall be provided and installed in locations approved by the public works department for each location where a street connects to the traffic circle in accordance with Chapter 7 "Traffic Design and Landscaping" of Federal Highway Administration Publication No. FHWA-RD-00-067 "Roundabouts: An Informational Guide", as amended. 
(3)  The center island shall consist of a circular curbed area within the public street right-of-way that is landscaped or developed to be aesthetically attractive while requiring a minimum of maintenance, as approved by the planning and zoning commission. Where right-of-way, topography, or other constraints preclude the ability to provide a curbed center island, a mountable curb with a traversable concrete apron may be required around the outer edge of the center island. 
(4)  A note on the plat shall state how the center island is to be developed and maintained, and that the subdivider or developer is responsible for maintenance during the first year following the date the plat is recorded. 
(m)  New streets of like alignment shall bear the names of existing streets and shall be dedicated at equal or greater widths than the existing streets. No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the name of existing streets. 
(n)  Names of new streets being constructed as part of a subdivision are subject to approval of the commission. Once a street is accepted by the city and the subdivision plat is recorded designating the name of such street, any subsequent change in the name of the street is subject to approval by the council. 
(o)  All new streets dedicated within a subdivision shall be improved in accordance with the construction standards of the city. 
(p)  If an existing public street or unimproved rights-of-way not meeting city standards for its classification designated in the thoroughfare plan with respect to width, drainage or surface type abuts the perimeter of a subdivision and provides the sole vehicular access to the subdivision or section thereof being platted, it shall be improved at the subdivider's expense to comply with such standards prior to acceptance of the subdivision by the city. The length of the improvement shall extend to the nearest existing street or portion thereof that meets city standards. Where the substandard perimeter street is already paved with a durable all-weather surface and has an adequate width for at least two lanes of traffic, the city may accept, as an alternative to the subdivider improving the street, a payment equal to one-half the estimated cost of improvement to city standards, as determined by the city engineer. Such payment shall be made concurrently with acceptance of the subdivision improvements by the city, and the city shall deposit the funds in an account reserved for future improvement of the substandard perimeter street. This option is available only when it is determined that the existing perimeter street, in its current state, is capable of carrying the expected traffic upon full development of the subdivision. The city may require a traffic impact study to be prepared at the subdivider's expense to document the existing capacity of the street. If the substandard perimeter street is listed in the city's road impact fee capital improvements plan, the city shall contribute to the required improvements as provided in section 52-143. 
(q)  If a tract is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to allow for the opening of future streets.

Sec. 52-73. - Alleys. 
(a)  Right-of-way for service alleys in commercial and industrial districts shall be a minimum of 25 feet in width, with a 20-foot wide pavement section. 
(b)  Alleys in residential districts shall be parallel, or approximately parallel, to the frontage street, and shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 15 feet, with a ten-foot wide pavement section. 
(c)  Alleys shall be optional in all new developments and replatted existing subdivisions, unless expressly required by the commission because of drainage, topographical features, circulation, or existing conditions which may necessitate the use of an alley in a particular location. Any right-of-way for alleys shall be dedicated to the city. 
(d)  Alleys shall be paved in accordance with the construction standards of the city. 
(e)  Where the deflection of alley alignment exceeds 30 degrees, a cutback of a minimum 15 feet, or of such greater distance to provide safe vehicular movement, shall be established on the inside property line and the paving of the alley shall be cut back in the same manner. 
(f)  Where the deflection of an alley alignment exceeds 15 degrees, a five-foot-wide pole guy easement shall be provided at the exterior of each point of deflection and normal hereto. The easement length shall be 15 feet for a deflection from 15 degrees to 30 degrees and 25 feet for deflection greater than 30 degrees. 
(g)  Dead-end alleys are prohibited. 
(h)  Access to residential property may be permitted from the alley. Access from the alley shall not exclude another means of access from the front or side.

Sec. 52-74. - Easements. 
(a)  Easements across lots, along and abutting front lot lines, or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities and drainage where necessary. Drainage easements must be exclusive and no improvements may be constructed therein. When such easements are shown on a subdivision plat, this exclusivity and restriction will be noted on the plat and included in any restrictive covenants. Drainage and utility easements will not be superimposed. 
(b)  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way or channel, a storm drain easement or drainage right-of-way, conforming substantially with such course and of a width to fulfill the requirements of the city's flood hazard area ordinance and drainage ordinance, as calculated by the developer's engineer, will be provided. Nonrestricted access shall be provided to all drainage ways and storm system easements for maintenance by the responsible parties. Access shall be provided within 500 feet of all points where drainage easements exist, and parallel streets or parkways may be required for access to the easement. 
(c)  Where alleys are not provided in a residential subdivision and utilities are to be provided in the rear of lots, a minimum seven and one-half-foot-wide utility easement shall be provided where needed along the rear of all lots within the subdivision. When one or more lots are located such that there is no similar easement in adjoining tracts, a minimum 15-foot wide easement will be provided. 
(d)  When the tract to be subdivided includes an easement of the blanket form or is a portion of a tract which includes such an easement, the subdivider shall take such action as is necessary prior to submission of the preliminary plat to have such easement removed or to have such easement redefined to a specific location and to a specific size or width. 
(e)  Public access easements may be provided to accommodate a required public sidewalk along and adjacent to the public street right-of-way where conflicts with natural features, utility equipment, or other appurtenances make the location of the sidewalk within the right-of-way impractical. Private access easements may be provided to accommodate joint vehicular access to adjacent lots in the subdivision. 
(Code 1982, § 23-3-4; Ord. No. 87-07, pt. 2, 4-28-87; Ord. No. 06-07, § III, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 52-75. - Blocks. 
(a)  The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
(1)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated. 
(2)  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions. 
(3)  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. 
(b)  In general, intersecting streets determining the block length and width shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet existing streets or in accordance with customary subdivision practices. Where no existing subdivision controls, the block lengths shall generally not exceed 800 feet along minor streets, 1,000 feet along collector streets, or 1,200 feet along arterial streets. Where no existing subdivision controls, the blocks shall generally not be less than 400 feet along minor or collector streets, or 500 feet along arterial streets. However, in cases where physical barriers or property ownership creates conditions where it is appropriate that these standards be varied, the length may be increased or decreased to meet the existing conditions having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of traffic and public safety. Where opposite sides of a block are along different classifications of streets, the length shall generally conform to the maximum and minimum limits applicable to the higher classification. 
(c)  Where blocks in the vicinity of a school, park or shopping center are 1,000 feet or longer, the commission may require a six-foot public pedestrian access easement near the middle of the block or at a street that terminates between streets at the ends of the block. 
(d)  Where no existing subdivision controls, the block depth shall be platted to give lots with a depth to width ratios of generally not more than two and one-half to one and in no case more than four to one, and the design shall be such that the block depth generally shall not exceed 350 feet. When possible, the block width and length shall be such to allow tiers of lots back to back. 
(e)  Blocks shall be labeled sequentially, from One or from A in each subdivision or section thereof. 
(Code 1982, § 23-3-5; Ord. No. 87-07, pt. 2, 4-28-87; Ord. No. 06-07, § III, 2-7-06; Ord. No. 2009-17, § II, 5-19-09) 
Sec. 52-76. - Lots. 
(a)  Lots shall conform to the minimum requirements of the applicable zoning district, except where a variance is approved by the zoning board of adjustment. Lots in the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall conform to the minimum requirements for the AO agricultural-Open space district. 
(b)  Each lot shall abut an improved public street right-of-way along at least one property line, except where private streets are approved in a planned development having the PDD zoning classification. 
(c)  Key lots or irregular shaped lots shall have sufficient width at the front building line to meet frontage requirements of the appropriate zoning district. Also, the rear width shall be sufficient to provide access for all utilities, but in no case less than ten feet. 
(d)  Flag lots, which have minimal or panhandle-type frontage, shall not be allowed in lieu of providing access to lots on the interior of a subdivision with one or more public streets except, however, that one flag lot may be approved in the subdivision of an extremely long and relatively narrow previously unplatted tract into two lots provided that the street frontage of the flag lot is at least 25 feet and the width of the lot where any building is constructed is at least the minimum required by the applicable zoning district. 
(e)  Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines. 
(f)  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots will be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantage of topography and orientation. Where lots have double frontage, a front building line shall be established for each street. 
(g)  Each lot in each block shall be labeled sequentially from one. 
(Code 1982, § 23-3-6; Ord. No. 87-07, pt. 2, 4-28-87; Ord. No. 97-03, § XV, 3-4-97; Ord. No. 06-07, § III, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 52-77. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  In those instances when a six-foot pedestrian access easement is provided in accordance with subsection 52-75(c), the applicant shall construct a sidewalk not less than four feet wide therein. 
(b)  Public sidewalks, not less than four feet wide, shall be provided on each side of all classifications of streets except for minor residential streets, including culs-de-sac exceeding 350 feet in length as measured in accordance with subsection 52-72(k), where a public sidewalk is required on only one side of the street. Required sidewalks shall be constructed by the builder for each lot before a certificate of occupancy will be issued for any structure thereon. Sidewalks required along public streets abutting property that is already developed, or abutting land areas dedicated for a public park in accordance with section 52-112, shall be constructed by the subdivider as a subdivision improvement prior to the plat being recorded. 
(c)  The location of sidewalks shall be noted on the subdivision plat. 
(d)  Sidewalks are not required: 
(1)  On culs-de-sac 350 feet or less in length. 
(2)  Along minor streets in residential subdivisions where no lot is less than one acre in size. 
(3)  When no more than four lots are being replatted where there was no requirement for sidewalks at the time the subdivision was originally platted. 
(4)  Where the commission authorizes a variance waiving all or a portion of the sidewalk requirement in accordance with section 52-3. 
(e)  In instances where construction of a required sidewalk in the public right-of-way is not feasible due to drainage considerations, topography, or lack of adequate unobstructed right-of-way width as determined by the city engineer, director of public works or designee, the sidewalk requirement may be satisfied by one of the following alternatives: 
(1)  The sidewalk may be constructed in a dedicated public access easement inside the private property of one or more lots along the street right-of-way; or 
(2)  The subdivider may, at the city's discretion, pay a fee in lieu of constructing the sidewalk based upon an estimated cost per linear foot provided by the director of public works, city engineer or designee; or provided by the subdivider's engineer and accepted by the director of public works, city engineer or designee. 
(f)  Curb ramps for the handicapped shall be constructed to comply with section 4.7 of the Texas Accessibility Standards of the Architectural Barriers Act, Article 9102, Texas Civil Statutes (April 1, 1994). 
(Code 1982, § 23-3-7; Ord. No. 87-07, pt. 2, 4-28-87; Ord. No. 06-07, § III, 2-7-06; Ord. No. 2009-17, § II, 5-19-09; Ord. No. 2009-20, § II, 7-7-09)

Sec. 52-80. - Flood hazard. 
(a)  The city may attach conditions to the approval of plats for areas subject to development problems in flood hazard areas in accordance with chapter 22 "Floods". 
(b)  Lots shall be graded and structures designed such that the ground level floor of buildings shall be a minimum of 12 inches above the highest point of the adjacent street top of curb, or above the crown of the street where there is no curb. Where the building is on a corner lot, this provision will apply to the highest top of curb or crown of the intersecting streets. Under special circumstances where such floor level is demonstrated by the subdivider's or developer's engineer to be impractical, one or more lots may be provided with drainage swale adjustment to prevent flooding of structures upon approval of a variance by the construction board of appeals. 
(Code 1982, § 23-3-10; Ord. No. 87-07, pt. 2, 4-28-87; Ord. No. 06-07, § III, 2-7-06; Ord. No. 2009-17, § II, 5-19-09)

Sec. 52-111. - Areas for public use. 
    The subdivider shall give consideration to one or more suitable sites for public parks, playgrounds and other public community facilities in accordance with the comprehensive plan and associated plans and policies of the city. A school site approved by the Lockhart Independent School District for purchase by the district shall be considered an eligible community facility for the purpose of this article. Any provision for schools, parks, etc., shall be indicated on the plat. Where land dedication or payment of fees in lieu of land dedication is required for a subdivision being platted in sequential phases, the entire land dedication or fee payment requirement shall be satisfied at the time of completion of the first phase or section. If the requirement is met through land dedication, it must have frontage on a dedicated and improved public street right-of-way. 
(Code 1982, § 23-4-1; Ord. No. 87-07, pt. 2, 4-28-87; Ord. No. 97-08, § I, 4-15-97; Ord. No. 06-07, § IV, 2-7-06; Ord. No. 2009-17, § III, 5-19-09) 
Sec. 52-112. - Land dedication. 
(a)  Except as provided in section 52-113 or for nonresidential subdivisions, land shall be dedicated by the subdivider in the amounts listed below or greater for community facilities or open space in any subdivision greater than five acres in size. 
(1)  Subdivision size over five acres up to and including 20 acres: Five percent of the total land area zoned or intended for residential use. 
(2)  Subdivision size over 20 acres: Eight percent of the total land area zoned or intended for residential use. 
(b)  The location, size and functions of the land to be dedicated for community facilities or public open space must be deemed by the city to be suitable for the intended use. If the subdivider develops the site for the approved public use at the subdivider's expense and with approval of the city, the land area dedicated may be decreased to the extent that the value of the improvements is equal to or more than the market value of the land area prior to development, as determined by the Caldwell County Tax Appraisal District, that is the difference between the minimum amount required and the amount actually dedicated. 
(c)  No property required to be dedicated for community facilities or public open space shall be in the 100-year floodplain except, however, that natural areas may include 100-year floodplain if determined by the city to be suitable for leisure activities such as hiking, bicycling, picnicking and wildlife observance, and such area is deemed by the city as needed or acceptable for such use in that location. 
(Ord. No. 06-07, § IV, 2-7-06) 
Sec. 52-113. - Fee in lieu of land dedication. 
(a)  In instances where dedication of land for community facilities or public open space is unacceptable, unsuitable, unneeded or infeasible within a subdivision, the subdivider may, at the city's discretion, pay a fee in lieu of land dedication specified in section 52-112 in the amounts listed below based upon the market value prior to development as determined by the Caldwell County Tax Appraisal District: 
(1)  Subdivision size over five acres up to and including 20 acres: Five percent of market value of land area that is zoned or intended for residential use. 
(2)  Subdivision size over 20 acres: Eight percent of market value of land area that is zoned or intended for residential use. 
(b)  For subdivisions greater than one acre in size up to five acres in size, where no land dedication is required, a fee shall be paid equal to five percent of the market value of land area that is zoned or intended for residential use. No fee or land dedication is required for subdivisions one acre or less in size. 
(c)  Fees paid to meet the community facility and public open space requirements shall be deposited by the city in an account for use only in the acquisition of land, purchase of equipment or construction of improvements for public open space, including parks, playgrounds, and natural areas.

Variances to the construction standards must be approved in writing by the city engineer and city manager or designee before construction begins. 
(b)  All construction work, such as street paving, storm sewers, curb and/or gutter work, sidewalks, sanitary sewers, water mains and electrical construction performed by the owner, developer or contractor, shall be subject to inspection during construction by the proper authority of the city, and shall be constructed in accordance with the construction standards of the city except for certain subdivisions in the extraterritorial jurisdiction as provided in the April 1, 2002, interlocal agreement between Caldwell County and the City of Lockhart, and available in the city secretary's office. 
(c)  The developer's engineer shall be responsible for inspection of all construction, and provide written documentation of such inspections for certification in accordance with section 52-202. 
(Ord. No. 2009-17, § IV, 5-19-09) 
Sec. 52-142. - Guarantee of performance. 
    The developer shall require guarantee of materials and workmanship of his construction contractors, with whom he contracts for furnishing materials and installing the improvements, required under this chapter and shall himself be responsible for guaranteeing that all materials and workmanship in connection with such improvements are free of defects for a period of one year after the date of acceptance of the improvements by the city manager, director of public works or designee. 
(Ord. No. 2009-17, § IV, 5-19-09) 
Sec. 52-143. - Responsibility for payment of infrastructure costs. 
(a)  The developer must pay for any required extensions of off-site water mains, wastewater mains, and electric primary lines unless otherwise negotiated by authorized city staff and approved by the city council. The city may pay for oversizing of mains and electric primary lines above the size required of the developer to provide sufficient domestic and fire protection water, wastewater service and electric primary lines for the development and any subsequent phases. All development costs associated with the subdivision shall be borne by the developer. The city shall have the right to recover all or part of the costs associated with in-place utility main or primary line extensions that will benefit development. Such cost recovery shall be based on proportionate use of such extensions or associated infrastructure. 
(b)  The city may pay, providing funds are available, for street right-of-way in excess of that required by the thoroughfare plan, except where such extra widths are in commercial developments, or where they're not required by the city. The city may participate, provided funds are available, in the extra cost of large drainage structures on major road/arterial streets shown on the thoroughfare plan. 
(c)  If a substandard perimeter street, as described in section 52-72, is listed in the city's road impact fee capital improvement plan, the city shall reimburse the subdivider for up to one-half the cost of the improvements to the extent that the funds are available in the road impact fee account. If, in such case, there are insufficient funds available in the road impact fee account, credit shall be given in the form of waiver of road impact fees for development in the subdivision equal to the amount of shortfall in the road impact fee account. The city's responsibility for reimbursement extends only to the road impact fee funds and/or credit available at the time the subdivision improvements are accepted by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2009-17, § IV, 5-19-09) 
Sec. 52-144. - Existing nonconforming subdivisions. 
    No building permit shall be issued by the city for any undeveloped lot in a previously platted subdivision where water, wastewater, street or other necessary public infrastructure to serve such lot does not meet current city standards unless such facilities are engineered and upgraded or constructed at the developer's expense in accordance with city's construction standards as provided in this chapter. If an undeveloped lot in an existing subdivision does not have frontage on a dedicated street right-of-way and is served only by a public or private access easement, where such lot is the only lot served by the easement, then no building permit shall be issued by the city unless paved access is constructed, at a minimum, in accordance with the current city standards for driveways. If an undeveloped lot in an existing subdivision does not have frontage on a dedicated street right-of-way and is served by a public access easement, where more than one lot is served by the same easement, then no building permit shall be issued by the city unless paved access is engineered and constructed in accordance with the city's construction standards for public streets as provided in this chapter.

But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in this division, pedestrians, facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.

a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, and may then turn right or, if the intersecting streets are both one-way streets and left turns are permissible, may turn left, after standing until the intersection may be entered safely, yielding right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Traffic not so turning shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. Turns shall be prohibited on a steady red sign if a notice is posted at such intersection giving notice that such turns are prohibited. 
b.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in this division, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(b)  In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. The motorman of any streetcar shall obey the above signals as applicable to vehicles.

(1)  Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through an intersection or past such signal only with caution. 
(b)  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in section 56-263 of this Code.

(1)  For permanent, residential service customers the deposit shall be the amount established by ordinance or resolution. 
(2)  For other rate classes, rate schedules, or groups of permanent service customers, the deposits shall be the amount equal to one-sixth of the estimated annual billing at that address where the same type of business or commercial activity use existed, but in no case shall required deposits be less than the minimum amounts established by ordinance or resolution. If the business occupancy use changes for a particular building, then the deposits may be based upon utility costs per square foot of another similar business use building. If there are no other similar existing business use buildings for comparison, then the deposits shall be based on the previous tenant business utility costs as described herein above. Deposits for businesses in new buildings shall be based on the utility costs per square foot of other similar use buildings. 
(3)  The deposit for service for temporary or seasonal customers and weekend residences in all classes or groups shall be one-sixth the estimated annual billing, or an amount sufficient to reasonably protect the city against the assumed risk of providing such services. 
(b)  Persons desiring to receive city utility services, and to have the initial deposit waived by presenting an acceptable utility provider letter of credit, must also meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Show proof that the applicant has been a customer of a utility service provider within the last two years and is not delinquent to said utility service provider; 
(2)  Never had service disconnected for nonpayment or did not have more than two delinquent payments during the last 12 consecutive months of service with said utility service provider; and 
(3)  The letter of credit must be mailed or faxed to the City of Lockhart from the previous utility service provider or must be a certified copy if presented by applicant at the time of application for service. If the applicant does not have a letter of credit, but one can be obtained from the previous utility service, then the deposit requirements must be met. Upon delivery of the letter of credit to the city utilities within 30 days of connection, the deposit will be refunded. A current verifiable bank letter of credit may be substituted in lieu of the requirements of this section. 
(c)  Additional deposit provisions are as follows: 
(1)  Residential. If an existing customer has established service for 12 months with the "City of Lockhart" and has met the credit requirements as described in subsection (b)(2), any additional residential account to be established in that same customer's name would not require a deposit. 
(2)  Commercial. If an existing customer has established service for 12 months with the "City of Lockhart" and has met the credit requirements as described in subsection (b)(2), any additional commercial account to be established in that same customer's name would not require a deposit. 
(3)  Realtors, management firms or owners of rental properties within the city that have utilities connected with the city within the last 12 months, regardless of the length of service, have never had service disconnected for nonpayment or been late in payment no more than one time would qualify for service without a deposit requirement. 
(4)  Established credit as met in the credit requirements as described in subsection (b)(2) cannot transfer to a different classification of service from which the credit was originally established in order to waive a deposit requirement. 
(5)  Credit history shall be applied equally, based upon a 12-month continuous service period, to a spouse or former spouse who shared a service and is now trying to establish a separate account. 
(6)  If a customer, with no deposit on file, is disconnected for nonpayment of utilities, a deposit amount equal to the current fees will be required before service will be activated. This will also apply to customers that had previously established credit as required in subsection (b)(2) or one that had presented a "letter of credit". 
(d)  If service is not connected for active accounts, the city utilities will promptly refund the customer's deposit. Upon disconnection of service for active accounts, the city utilities shall automatically refund the customer's deposit, in excess of the unpaid bills for service furnished, at the next billing cycle for that account. 
(e)  For active accounts which have a 12-month payment history of no delinquencies or disconnects for nonpayment, the deposit shall be automatically applied to the account's next billing. In no event will the city issue a check for refunds on utility deposits for active accounts.

The City of Lockhart also shall or may disconnect or discontinue any city-controlled utility service to any structure or habitation when the safety and welfare of occupants of the same structure are endangered because of violations of the Code of Ordinances hereinabove mentioned. If the use of a structure or habitation changes as to place same in violation of one or more of the hereinabove-mentioned codes, utilities shall be discontinued. Where code violations exist, the collection of utility deposits herein mentioned shall not constitute the right of connection, temporary connection or continued connection of utilities. 
(2)  The applicant's installation, workmanship, equipment, or devices is known, or found to be, hazardous to public health and safety or of such character where satisfactory service cannot be given. 
(3)  The applicant has an outstanding balance owed the city for a previous utility services account. If such averages are paid in full, service may be connected providing that all deposit requirements are met.

Sec. 58-42. - Budget billing payment plan. 
(a)  A customer may apply to participate in an optional payment plan, designed to make monthly bills more manageable throughout the year. Under this plan the customer will be charged each month for actual consumption, including any adjustments, but will pay an amount each month based upon an average. The average is calculated as a rolling average based on a customer's current bill plus their last 11 bills and plus or minus any adjustments to the customer's account. When a customer finalizes their account, payment of the balance owed on their utility account will occur. The optional payment plan is not intended to be used to defer payment of delinquent bills. 
(b)  Eligibility requirements: 
(1)  An applicant for budget billing must meet certain qualifications. All applications are subject to city approval. The budget payment plan will be available only to residential customers. A customer can be budgeted on one service or more services without being budgeted on all services. Budget billing can only occur on consumption type services. Flat or other services are not eligible for budget billing. 
(2)  Customers or the premises must have a minimum of 12 months of continuous service on city utilities to be eligible. This may have been attained at one or more addresses within the city's billing service area, and applies only to the customer's primary residence. A customer transferring from one address to another address may continue to participate. 
(3)  To be eligible, customers who make application to be on budget billing must not have had any of their service(s) disconnected during the preceding six months for nonpayment or must not have had any insufficient funds check returned during the preceding six months. Applicant must also have maintained a good utility payment history with no more than one late payment within the preceding six months and no previous balance on their account. They must also not be facing or subject to bankruptcy proceedings. 
(4)  A customer who is already on budget billing and whose service is disconnected for nonpayment, or who submits an insufficient funds check, rejected bank or credit card draft or has a credit card payment declined during their enrollment period on the program, shall be removed from budget billing. Any amounts due will be subject to immediate collection. Such customers may then become eligible for re-enrollment after establishing a good pay history and meeting the eligibility requirements to participate in this plan. 
(5)  A customer may voluntarily discontinue their participation in budget billing and revert to regular billing at any time. Upon discontinuation, the customer is ineligible to apply for re-enrollment in budget billing for a minimum of 12 months and meeting the eligibility requirements. 
(6)  A customer who terminates services entirely, and reconnects at a future date is also ineligible for re-enrollment in budget billing for a minimum of 12 months and meeting the eligibility requirements. 
(c)  Method of billing: 
(1)  The monthly budget bill will be the rolling average amount each month during a calendar year. The average is calculated as a rolling average based on a customer's current bill plus their last 11 bills and plus or minus any adjustments to the customer's account. Flat and other service amounts are not eligible for averaging but will be factored into the budget billing amount. This method of billing will result in an accumulated debit or credit on a customer's account. 
(2)  No interest will be charged on any account debit balance accrued under budget billing. Neither will interest be paid on any account credit balance accrued under budget billing. 
(3)  Customers who discontinue budget billing at any time or for any reason will have their account settled up. Any debit, or a balance owed to the city reflecting actual billings higher than the total budget bill will be due and payable with the next billing for those customers who continue city electric utility service. 
(4)  Finalized accounts (terminating and not involving transfer of service) reflecting a credit balance will have the amount credited against the final bill. If the credit balance is larger than the final bill, a refund check will be issued to the customer for the difference. If a final account reflects a debit balance, this amount as well as any other charges owed by the customer will be due and payable immediately to the city. 
(5)  Under no circumstances will any accumulated credit be used to reduce a customer's bill unless participation is discontinued. 
(6)  The city will continue to read the meters each month and will provide full information on the billing statement. Monthly bills will show the actual consumption, the regular itemized charges computed on the actual consumption, and the total payment due under the budget billing. 
(7)  Utility rates are not changed for budget billing, but it allows a customer to pay the same amount each month rather than more in high usage months and less in low usage months. 
(d)  If utility rates are changed at any time, the new rates will be factored into the billing. 
(e)  Customers can apply for budget billing at any time. If eligible, the customer can go on this payment plan at any time during the year. Terms of agreement and the application form will be furnished by the city. 
(f)  If a customer on budget billing experiences a rate classification change, such as from residential to commercial or industrial, they will be discontinued from the program as budget billing applies only to single residential service. The account will then be adjusted as described in subsection (c)(3) of this section. No cash refunds will be made for any credit accrued unless the customer discontinues receiving service and the account is finalized. 
(g)  Budget billing accounts shall be subject to the same rules, rates, charges, fees, penalties, and policies established by the city as regular utility customer accounts.

To be eligible for an optional, reduced fee, the applicable read-in/read-out form with all necessary signatures, readings and dates must be submitted prior to the actual transfer. 
(1)  Level one. $5.00 for account transfer when the read and change system utilized. 
(2)  Level two. $15.00 for account transfer when a customer services representative physically performs meter readings, but no pulling of meters or utility disconnections is involved. 
(3)  Level three. $25.00 for account transfer when a complete meter disconnection/reconnection is involved. 
(Ord. No. 98-31, § I, 10-20-98) 
Sec. 58-44. - Liens. 
    The city shall have the right, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 402.0025, to impose a lien against an owner's property for delinquent utility bills imposed for municipal utility service on the property. This right shall not apply to the following properties:

The city's lien may include penalties, interest, and collection costs. 
The city's lien is superior to all other liens except a bona fide mortgage lien recorded before the recording of the city's lien in the real property records of Caldwell County, Texas.

Such funds shall be placed in a Good Neighbor Utility Contribution Program fund. Thirty days' advanced notice will be required to start or stop contributions paid on a utility bill. These voluntarily funds are to be used exclusively for the public purpose of helping City of Lockhart utility customers who require assistance from time to time paying their utility bills. The city council shall designate a non-profit agency or entity that will distribute the contribution funds to City of Lockhart utility customers according to criteria contained in an agreement approved by the city council.

Zoning districts have been selected to enhance the usage trends indicated by the comprehensive master plan. 
(c)  The zoning districts are designed to provide flexibility of use while retaining the limitations necessary to protect existing areas and uses and to avoid undue population concentration and lessen street congestion. Limits have been placed on development which is not conducive to desirable and attractive growth while providing areas for most uses and allowing for utilization of the many smaller tracts that presently exist within the city. 
(d)  To provide for new and changing uses, the definitions of allowable and permitted uses within each zoning district are written in a general and generic form. When there is a question concerning the definition or meaning of any such use, the planning and zoning commission is authorized to define such use. 
(e)  It is also the intent of this chapter to provide for the integrity of residential neighborhoods and to provide for appropriate commercial, industrial, and public facilities while allowing sufficient flexibility to promote orderly growth and development. 
(f)  The zoning regulations are also designed to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewers, schools, parks, and other public requirements.

Editor's note- The zoning map referenced in this article is not set out herein, but is displayed and available for inspection as provided in subsection 64-31(e). 

Sec. 64-31. - Authenticity and maintenance. 
(a)  The city, having previously been divided and zoned into use districts, with subsequent rezoning in the several districts, adopts and declares to be a part of this chapter that map prepared in 1986, and subsequently updated and adopted on March 6, 1990, and updated again on October 6, 1998, as the official zoning map. 
(b)  The map shall be signed by the zoning administrator to attest to its accuracy. 
(c)  The map shall be signed by the mayor to attest to its adoption by the city council. 
(d)  The map shall be signed by the city secretary to attest to its authenticity and to its receipt on the date of adoption. 
(e)  The map shall be displayed in a secured transparent-faced case at a public location selected by the zoning administrator. 
(f)  Changes to the official zoning map shall be made only under the direct supervision of the zoning administrator. 
(g)  Changes made to the corporate limits of the city or additions or subdivisions approved by the council and subsequently recorded shall be added to the map and a marginal notation made giving the annexation ordinance number and adoption date, along with the volume and page where recorded, or the subdivision/addition name and the plat book and page where recorded. The notation shall be dated and initialed by the zoning administrator. 
(h)  Rezoned tracts shall be individually outlined on the map. Each rezoned tract shall be marked with a sequential key number and a marginal notation made giving the key number, new zoning designation, agency approving such action, and a reference to the ordinance or court order authorizing such action. The notation shall be dated and initialed by the zoning administrator. 
(i)  Copies of all or part of the official zoning map may be made for use, sale, or reference; but only the original of the official zoning map, as amended, shall be deemed as the official current zoning status within the city. 
(j)  If the official zoning map becomes difficult to interpret due to damage or due to the number and/or nature of changes or additions thereto, the council may adopt by ordinance a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior map. The new official zoning map may also correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the prior map. The new official zoning map shall reference the effective date of the prior map and shall be attested and authenticated as in subsections (b), (c), and (d), of this section. 
(k)  Should the official zoning map become lost or destroyed, a new official zoning map shall be reconstructed by the zoning administrator from any reliable source of copies and from such other documentation available. After a public hearing concerning the accuracy thereof, the council may adopt by ordinance such map to be the new official zoning map. The new official zoning map shall be attested and authenticated as in subsections (b), (c), and (d), of this section. Should the lost map be discovered prior to amendment of the reconstructed map, the reconstructed map shall be void. If one or more amendments have been made to the reconstructed map, such corrections to the reconstructed map, as are needed to bring it into conformity with the previously lost map, shall be made by the zoning administrator as in subsection (h) above, and those property owners affected by the corrections notified by ordinary mail. The reconstructed map shall then continue in effect as the official zoning map. 
(l)  Any superseded official zoning map, or remaining portions thereof, along with documentation of actions modifying such maps shall be maintained in the files of the city.

(1)  Unless otherwise clearly shown on the map, where district boundaries follow the centerline of a street, alley, waterway, railroads, or other rights-of-way, the centerline of such or, where appropriate, the extension or continuation of the centerline shall be construed to be the district boundary. 
(2)  Unless otherwise clearly shown on the map, where district boundaries follow approximately along lot or tract lines, the actual lot or tract line or, where appropriate, the extension thereof, shall constitute the boundary. 
(3)  When property is hereafter subdivided into lots and blocks and the district lines on the official zoning map differ from the platted lines, the nearest platted line shall become the district boundary unless indicated otherwise on the plat of such subdivision. 
(4)  Where a district boundary crosses an existing platted or described lot or tract, the nearest existing property line, as of January 1, 1986, shall be construed to be such district boundary. 
(5)  Where a district boundary crosses an unsubdivided tract larger than two acres, the location of such boundary shall be determined from the nearest identifiable line shown on the map by use of the scale appearing on the map. 
(6)  When none of the above apply or there is a dispute as to actual location of the district boundary, the commission shall make such determination.

If the value of the building in its destroyed or damaged state is determined to be 40 percent of more of its assessed value before the damaging event occured, the building can be repaired, restored, or reconstructed, and it may then continue to be used as before. Such repair, restoration, or reconstruction must be completed within 12 months of the damaging event.

Notification of the delay by telephone shall be deemed sufficient notification. The building official shall estimate the number of additional days reasonably necessary to approve and issue the permit, and shall so inform the applicant. Under no circumstances will an application for a building permit be considered automatically approved without proper and sufficient review and issuance by the building official. 
a.  If the application is in full compliance with this chapter and all provisions of the building codes, the applicant shall be notified by telephone that the building permit will be issued.

No renewals shall be approved beyond 18 months of the original permit issue date. 
(7)  A building permit shall be revoked and/or a stop work order issued by the building official at any time prior to the completion of the building or structure for which the same was issued, when it shall appear that there is departure from the plans, specifications, or conditions as required under terms of the permit; that the same was procured by false representation; was issued in error; or that any of the provisions of the building codes or of the zoning chapter are being violated.

(4)  The variance will not alter the essential character of the zoning district within which the property is located, and is in harmony with the intent and purposes of this chapter.

(b)  Variances may be granted only in the following instances:

f.  Any residence used to house nonfamily residents shall provide one additional off-street parking space per residence room. 
(3)  All off-street parking within all other districts shall meet the requirements of the applicable portions of this section and of appendices I and II. Off-street parking areas need not be on the same lot as the principal structure or use but must be within 300 feet of said structure or use. 
(4)  Any business or industrial building, hospital, institution, or hotel hereafter erected, constructed, reconstructed, or altered, in any district, shall provide adequate off-street facilities for the loading and unloading of merchandise and goods within or adjacent to the building, in such a manner as not to obstruct freedom of traffic movement of the public streets, alleys or sidewalks.

Sec. 64-202. - Same-Wireless telecommunication facilities. 
(a)  Existing facilities: Any wireless telecommunication facility for which a permit has been properly issued prior to April 8, 1998, shall not be required to meet the requirements of this chapter as they relate to wireless telecommunication facilities other than requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC). However, any alteration of an existing facility on or after April 8, 1998 shall be subject to all applicable requirements. 
(b)  Code requirements: Wireless telecommunication facilities of any type must comply with all applicable requirements of the FAA and FCC, as documented in writing from the approving authority at the time of building permit application. Freestanding towers and their foundations shall meet all wind, seismic, and all other design requirements of the adopted building code. Drawings and specifications shall be prepared and sealed by a registered professional engineer and shall be submitted with the building permit application. Permits are required for new construction or alteration of a tower, although additional antennas not increasing the height of the structure may be added to an existing tower without permits except as may be needed for electrical wiring. 
(c)  Co-location capability: New freestanding towers classified as a wireless telecommunication facility-high impact containing antennas for purposes other than commercial radio or television broadcast shall be designed and constructed to support a minimum of four antenna arrays from separate wireless telecommunication system providers or users. An affidavit shall be submitted with the building permit application stating the extent to which the tower owner agrees to allow additional equipment by other service providers to be located on the tower and its premises on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis. 
(d)  Availability of sites: Each applicant for administrative approval or a specific use permit for a new freestanding tower containing antennas for purposes other than commercial radio or television broadcast shall provide an inventory of its existing towers within the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each such tower and the number of antennas that may be supported by it. A building permit for new freestanding towers shall not be approved unless the applicant provides satisfactory evidence that there are no alternative locations available on existing towers, buildings, or other structures that: 1) are structurally capable of supporting the intended antenna; 2) meet the necessary height requirements; 3) provide a location free of electromagnetic interference; and 4) can comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
(e)  Abandoned facilities: The owner of the property shall notify the building official at such time that a wireless telecommunication facility ceases operation. Any tower or antenna that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such tower or antenna, or the owner of the property, shall remove same including any accessory equipment, within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city. If the tower or antenna is not removed within said 60 days, the city may cause removal of such tower or antenna at the property owner's expense. After written notice to the property owner, the city may place a lien on the property until the city is reimbursed for the cost of removal of the abandoned wireless telecommunication facility. If there are two or more users of a single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all antennas located on the tower cease operation for the period specified above. 
(f)  Facilities on public property: Wireless telecommunication facilities for use by commercial system providers may be allowed in a street right-of-way, or on other public property controlled by the city only upon approval by the city council of a lease, license, or franchise agreement, including arrangements for payment of appropriate compensation as may be established by the city council. 
(g)  Prohibited location: No freestanding tower, or commercial antenna attached to any other structure, shall be erected in a location in the city where the tower or antenna would be visible when viewed by eyes five feet, eight inches above ground level from any portion of the county courthouse property or abutting portions of Main, San Antonio, Commerce and Market Street rights-of-way. This does not prohibit locations that are otherwise permitted by this chapter and where the line of sight is blocked by buildings or other structures existing at the time of application for approval of the wireless telecommunication facility. Future removal of such buildings or other structures shall not change the status of a wireless telecommunication facility to nonconforming. 
(h)  Access: Each site of a freestanding tower shall have direct access to a public street provided by a driveway meeting city standards. The driveway shall extend from the street to an appropriate location on the premises where a vehicle would need to be parked to facilitate normal maintenance of the facility. 
(i)  Height: No wireless communication facility shall encroach upon the height limits, if applicable, of Lockhart Municipal Airport hazard zones as adopted December 18, 1991. In no case shall a freestanding tower exceed a height of 200 feet, except where a height variance is granted by the board of adjustments due to demonstration of a hardship by the applicant that can only be remedied by location of the facility on the proposed site within the city limits. Antennas mounted as an accessory on top of a building, water tower, lighting standard, electric utility transmission tower, or other tall structure having another primary function shall not extend more than 15 feet above the highest point of the structure as measured from the average ground level around the structure. 
(j)  Setbacks: A nonexempt freestanding tower shall be setback from all boundaries of the property on which it is located by a distance equal to the height of the tower, and shall be setback from any residential dwelling or residential zoning district a distance equal to twice, the height of the tower, as measured from the base of the main tower structure. Associated equipment enclosures or other buildings and structures, and guy wire anchors, if any, located on the same property are subject to the normal building setback requirements of the district within which the facility is located. Antennas mounted as an accessory on the side of a building, water tower, lighting standard, electric utility transmission tower, or other tall structure having another primary function, may extend up to two feet into the required building setback, but in no case shall extend closer than five feet to any property line. 
(k)  Illumination and appearance: Wireless telecommunication facilities shall not be artificially illuminated except as required by the FAA or FCC, and except for motion-detector operated security lights on any associated equipment enclosure. Freestanding towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or be painted sky blue or gray, except as otherwise required by the FAA or FCC. Unless the tower compound is screened by any means from adjacent streets, residential dwellings, and residential zoning districts, the design of equipment enclosures shall, to the extent possible, use materials and colors that are compatible with the natural and built environment of the surrounding area. Antennas mounted as an accessory on a building, water tower, lighting standard, electric utility transmission tower, or other tall structure having another primary function shall be identical in color or closely compatible with the color of the adjacent portion of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(l)  Security and screening: The base of freestanding towers, and associated equipment enclosures shall be enclosed by a security fence or wall not less than six feet in height with an access gate that is kept locked at all times except when attended by authorized personnel. The base of the tower and associated equipment enclosures shall also be screened on any side facing a public street, residential dwelling, or residential zoning district in accordance with any one or more of the following alternatives: 1) preserve existing dense evergreen vegetation or natural landforms that effectively screen the tower compound; 2) plant new dense evergreen vegetation having a mature height of at least six feet; or 3) construct the security fencing to provide opaque screening consisting of materials and colors that are compatible with the natural and built environment of the surrounding area. 
(m)  Signage. No sign, banner, or flag shall be placed in a visible location on the exterior of a wireless telecommunication facility or its premises except one nonilluminated permanent sign not larger than two square feet for the purpose of identification in the case of an emergency. No commercial advertising is permitted. 
(n)  Historic districts. Any wireless telecommunication facility to be installed outside of a building anywhere in a historic district established by the city council shall be subject to approval of a certificate of alteration by the city historical preservation commission.
