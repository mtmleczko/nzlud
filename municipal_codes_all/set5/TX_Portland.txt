PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Portland, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1970 Code, as supplemented through May 18, 2010, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1970 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE 1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Eric Grant, Vice President, and Anne Wilson and Janet Cramer, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Annette Hall, City Secretary, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of Portland.

    Section 5. That any and all additions and amendments to such Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the city council to make the same a part thereof shall be deemed to be incorporated in such Code so that reference to the "Code of Ordinances, City of Portland, Texas" shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments.

Section 2.09. - Emergency Ordinances. 
    To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or the public peace, the council may adopt one or more emergency ordinances, but such ordinances may not levy taxes, grant, renew or extend a franchise, regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services or authorize the borrowing of money except as provided in subsection 5.11.(b). An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least five members shall be required for adoption.

The amount of this indemnity by the city shall not exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) to any one (1) person or three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) for any single occurrence in the case of personal injury or death, or ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for a single occurrence of property damage. 
(b)  The City of Portland shall indemnify and hold harmless said officers from any cost that may be incurred in the defense of any such claim or lawsuit that may be filed. The city shall however, have the right to designate legal counsel for the purpose of providing representation for said persons under the terms and provisions of this section. Nothing shall prevent such person or persons from employing outside legal counsel or securing legal advice from attorneys other than the attorneys that the city may provide. However, in doing so, such person shall not have an absolute right to the benefits of this section, and the same may be reviewed by the city council as to the reasonableness of the expenses incurred, as well as all other factors relating to the handling of any such claim or cause of action. 
(c)  The indemnity offered by the city shall not cover any damages or expenses incurred by reason of willful or wrongful acts or omissions, or acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, taken by the officials or employees described in subsection (a) above.

Sec. 2-111. - Personnel Policy Manual. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1000, § 1, adopted Nov. 16, 1999, approved the adoption of the City of Portland Personnel Policy Manual. The Personnel Manual is not set out herein and is on file in the city clerk's office and available for inspection during normal business hours. 
Sec. 2-112. - Indemnification of city officials and employees. 
(a)  Definitions. For the purposes of this ordinance the term "officer" shall include any elected or appointed official of the city. "Officer" includes the municipal court judge, municipal court prosecutor and city attorney. The term "employee" shall include all employees of the city, including certified peace officers, fire fighters and shall include authorized volunteers, working under a volunteer program approved by the city council. The term "arising out of the course and scope of employment" shall include any duty, employment or action arising out of the normal or required service or employment rendered to or for the city, but shall not include any action which occurs during a period of time in which the officer or employee is engaged in outside employment or is rendering contractual services to someone or some entity other than the city. 
(b)  Indemnification. Any officer or employee who is liable, or alleged to be liable, for the payment of any claims or damages arising out of the course and scope of employment shall be entitled to indemnification by the city, provided that the acts or omissions resulting in such liability or alleged liability were done in good faith and without malicious or felonious intent. Whether the acts were done in good faith, without malicious or felonious intent, and within the course and scope of employment shall be determined by the city, and such determination shall be final for the purposes of the representation and indemnification of this ordinance. However, in the event representation and indemnity have been denied by the city, if upon a trial on the merits, the city determines that the officer or employee was acting in good faith, without malicious or felonious intent and within the scope of employment, the indemnification hereunder shall be granted and reasonable legal expenses incurred in the defense of the claim reimbursed. The city shall not be liable for any settlement of any such claim or suit made or entered into without its consent, and the city reserves the right to assert any defense and make any settlement of any claim or suit that it deems expedient. 
(c)  Representation in actions. The city shall have the right and duty to provide legal representation through the city attorney, or in its sole discretion through the selection of outside legal counsel, to any officer or employee sued in connection with any claim for damages or other civil action against such person arising out of the course and scope of employment, provided that such officer or employee is entitled to indemnification as set forth in this section. Such legal representation shall be provided at no cost to the officer or employee, and any officer or employee may have his or her own counsel assist in the defense at the sole expense of the officer or employee. The officer, employee and/or personal counsel shall fully cooperate with the city and legal counsel in preparation and presentation of the case, and the failure to cooperate shall waive such officer's or employee's right to representation and indemnity under this section. 
(d)  City's defenses. Nothing in this section shall be construed as waiving the city's defense of governmental immunity to it or its employees or officers in any action brought against the city or such officer or employee. For any suit or claim arising under the Texas Tort Claims Act, the indemnity provided by this section shall be limited to the statutory limits applicable to the city provided in said Act, as it now reads or as it may hereafter be amended. 
(e)  Notice. The provisions of this section shall apply only where the city has been given notice of the actions brought against any city officer or employee within ten (10) calendar days of service of process upon the officer or employee. The city may, but is not required to, waive this notice requirement. 
(f)  Disciplinary actions. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from taking disciplinary action against any officer or employee for conduct defended or indemnified by the city under this section, either before or after conclusion of the civil suit. 
(g)  Suits in behalf of the city. Nothing in this section shall require the city to indemnify any officer or employee for recoveries made against him or her in suits by or on behalf of the city or to provide a defense to such claim or suit. The city council may, however, authorize the city attorney to represent any officer or employee in a suit brought by a citizen or taxpayer in behalf of the city against the officer or employee.

ARTICLE VIII. - IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION POLICY 

Sec. 2-166. - Background. 
    The risk to the city, its employees and customers from data loss and identity theft is of significant concern to the city and can be reduced only through the combined efforts of every employee and contractor. 
(Ord. No. 2001, § 2(Exh. A), 11-4-08) 
Sec. 2-167. - Purpose. 
    The city adopts this sensitive information policy to help protect employees, customers, contractors and the city from damages related to the loss or misuse of sensitive information. 
    This policy will: 
(1)  Define sensitive information; 
(2)  Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper; 
(3)  Describe the electronic security of data when stored and distributed; and 
(4)  Place the city in compliance with state and federal law regarding identity theft protection. 
    This policy enables the city to protect existing customers, reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the city from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the city: 
(1)  Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within new or existing covered accounts; 
(2)  Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts; 
(3)  Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and 
(4)  Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program. 
(Ord. No. 2001, § 2(Exh. A), 11-4-08) 
Sec. 2-168. - Scope. 
    This policy and protection program applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at the city, including all personnel affiliated with third parties. 
(Ord. No. 2001, § 2(Exh. A), 11-4-08) 
Sec. 2-169. - Policy. 
(a)  Sensitive information policy. 
(1)  Sensitive information includes the following items whether stored in electronic or printed format: 
a.  Credit card information, including any of the following: 
1.  Credit card number (in part or whole). 
2.  Credit card expiration date. 
3.  Cardholder name. 
4.  Cardholder address. 
b.  Tax identification numbers, including: 
1.  Social Security number. 
2.  Business identification number. 
3.  Employer identification numbers. 
c.  Payroll information, including, among other information:

1.  Date of birth. 
2.  Address. 
3.  Phone numbers. 
4.  Maiden name. 
5.  Names. 
6.  Customer number. 
    City personnel are encouraged to use common sense judgment in securing confidential information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this section should be read in conjunction with the Texas Open Records Act and the city's open records policy. If an employee is uncertain of the sensitivity of a particular piece of information, he/she should contact their supervisor. In the event that the city cannot resolve a conflict between this policy and the Texas Open Records Act, the city will contact the state attorney general's office for guidance. 
(b)  Hard copy distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work for the city will comply with the following policies: 
(1)  File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets, and any other storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked when not in use. 
(2)  Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information and record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when unsupervised. 
(3)  Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive information when not in use. 
(4)  Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, etc. in common shared work areas will be erased, removed, or shredded when not in use. 
(5)  When documents containing sensitive information are discarded they will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a suitable shredding device. Locked shred bins are labeled "Confidential paper shredding and recycling." City records, however, may only be destroyed in accordance with the city's records retention policy. 
(c)  Electronic distribution. Each employee and contractor performing work for the city will comply with the following policies: 
(1)  Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using approved municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when stored in an electronic format. 
(2)  Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement such as this should be included in the e-mail: 
"This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary information and is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally addressed. Any use by others is strictly prohibited." 
(d)  Red flags. 
(1)  The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud. Any time a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it should be investigated for verification. 
a.  Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting agency; 
b.  A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report; 
c.  A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in response to a request for a consumer report; or 
d.  A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency as defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions Act. 
(2)  Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as: 
a.  A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries; 
b.  An unusual number of recently established credit relationships; 
c.  A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit relationships; or 
d.  An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor. 
(3)  Suspicious documents. 
a.  Documents provided for identification that appear to have been altered or forged. 
b.  The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the identification. 
c.  Other information on the identification is not consistent with information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer presenting the identification. 
d.  Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the city, such as a signature card or a recent check. 
e.  An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled. 
(4)  Suspicious personal identifying information. 
a.  Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when compared against external information sources used by the city. For example: 
 The address does not match any address in the consumer report; 
 The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed on the Social Security Administration death master file; or 
 Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth. 
b.  Personal identifying information provided is associated with known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the city. For example, the address on an application is the same as the address provided on a fraudulent application. 
c.  Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the city. For example: 
 The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a prison; or 
 The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or answering service. 
d.  The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons opening an account or other customers. 
e.  The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of other customers or other persons opening accounts. 
f.  The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete. 
g.  Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the city. 
h.  When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name, etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report. 
(5)  Unusual use of, or suspicious activity related to, the covered account. 
a.  Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered account, the city receives a request for new, additional, or replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account. 
b.  A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments. 
c.  A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example: 
 Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments; 
 A material change in purchasing or usage patterns. 
d.  A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors). 
e.  Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's covered account. 
f.  The city is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements. 
g.  The city is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's covered account. 
h.  The city receives notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the city. 
i.  The city is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft. 
(e)  Detecting red flags. 
(1)  New accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified above associated with the opening of a new account, utility billing employees will take the following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the account: 
a.  Require certain identifying information such as name, date of birth, residential or business address, principal place of business for an entity, driver's license or other identification; 
b.  Verify the customer's identity (for instance, review a driver's license or other identification card); 
c.  Review documentation showing the existence of a business entity; 
d.  Request additional documentation to establish identity; and 
e.  Independently contact the customer or business. 
(2)  Existing accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified above for an existing account, utility billing employees will take the following steps to monitor transactions with an account: 
a.  Verify the identification of customers if they request information (in person, via telephone, via facsimile, via email); 
b.  Verify the validity of requests to close accounts or change billing addresses; and 
c.  Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment purposes. 
(f)  Preventing and mitigating identity theft. 
(1)  Prevent and mitigate. In the event utility billing employees detect any identified red flags, such personnel shall take one (1) or more of the following steps, depending on the degree of risk posed by the red flag: 
a.  Continue to monitor an account for evidence of identity theft; 
b.  Contact the customer, sometimes through multiple methods; 
c.  Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access to accounts; 
d.  Not open a new account; 
e.  Close an existing account; 
f.  Do not close the account, but monitor or contact authorities; 
g.  Reopen an account with a new number; 
h.  Notify the program administrator for determination of the appropriate step(s) to take; 
i.  Notify law enforcement; or 
j.  Determine that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances. 
(2)  Protect customer identifying information. In order to further prevent the likelihood of identity theft occurring with respect to utility accounts, the city will take the following steps with respect to its internal operating procedures to protect customer identifying information: 
a.  Ensure that its website is secure or provide clear notice that the website is not secure; 
b.  Where and when allowed, ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and computer files containing customer information; 
c.  Ensure that office computers are password protected and that computer screens lock after a set period of time; 
d.  Change passwords on office computers on a regular basis; 
e.  Ensure all computers are backed up properly and any backup information is secured; 
f.  Keep offices clear of papers containing customer information; 
g.  Request only the last four (4) digits of Social Security numbers (if any); 
h.  Ensure computer virus protection is up to date; and 
i.  Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that are necessary for utility purposes. 
(g)  Program administration. 
(1)  The importance of this program warrants the highest level of attention by administration and staff. The city manager or his designee shall be responsible for developing and implementing this program. 
(2)  Staff training shall be conducted for any employee, official or contractor who may reasonably come into contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that it may constitute a risk to the city or its customers. 
(3)  All service providers with access to sensitive information shall be required to show proof of adherence to reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements. 
(4)  This policy may be amended by the city manager as needed to comply with changing laws, and to maintain consistency with the current state of the identity theft problem. 
(h)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the city's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices is limited to employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

ARTICLE III. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Section 3 of Ord. No. 707, adopted Jan. 2, 1985, repealed Ord. No. 523, §§ 1-7, adopted May 17, 1977, from which Art. III, §§ 4-30-4-36, pertaining to flood protection, was derived. Section 1 of Ord. No. 707 enacted provisions relatively similar in nature which were designated by the city as a new Art. III, §§ 4-30-4-35. 

Sec. 4-30. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods. 
(A)  Statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Texas has in the Texas Water Code, Section 16.311 et seq., delegated the authority to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of the City of Portland, Texas, does ordain as follows in this article. 
(B)  Findings of fact: 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Portland, Texas, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(C)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(D)  Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 707, § 1, 1-2-85) 
Sec. 4-31. - Definition of terms. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application: 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the building official's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH or VO Zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is defined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-99, VO or V1-30. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Breakaway walls means any type of wall, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic, or any other suitable building material, which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is so designed to breakaway under abnormal riverine velocities, or high tides and wave action, if applicable, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which it is used or any buildings to which it might be carried by floodwaters. 
    Coastal high hazard area means the area subject to high-velocity waters, including, but not limited to, hurricane wave wash or tsunamis. The area is designated on a FIRM as Zone V1-30. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. 
    Existing mobile home park or mobile home subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more mobile home lots for rent or sale for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lot on which the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and the construction of streets) is completed before the effective date of this article. 
    Expansion to an existing mobile home park or mobile home subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the mobile homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, either final site grading or pouring of concrete pads, or the construction of streets). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(a)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(b)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, the water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood hazard boundary-floodway map. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Habitable floor means any floor usable for living purposes, which includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used for storage purposes only is not a "habitable floor." 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Mangrove stand means an assemblage of mangrove trees which are mostly low trees noted for a copious development of interlacing adventitious roots above the ground and which contain one (1) or more of the following species: Black mangrove (Avicennia Nitida); red mangrove (Rhizophora Mangle); white mangrove (Languncularia Racemosa); and buttonwood (Conocarpus Erecta). 
    Mean seal level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. 
    Mobile home means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. It does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers. 
    New mobile home park or mobile home subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more mobile home lots for rent or sale for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lot on which the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and the construction of streets) is completed on or after the effective date of this article. 
    Sand dunes mean naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of a beach. 
    Start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (other than a mobile home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the state of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure (other than a mobile home) without a basement or poured footings, the "start of construction" includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation. For mobile homes not within a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, "start of construction" means the affixing of the mobile home to its permanent site. For mobile homes within mobile home parks or mobile home subdivisions, "start of construction" is the date on which the construction of facilities for servicing the site on which the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the construction of streets, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and installation of utilities) is completed. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, as well as a mobile home. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
    Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

Sec. 4-32. - General provisions. 
(A)  Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Portland, Texas. 
(B)  Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Portland, Texas," dated, November 4, 2016, or as currently amended, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood hazard boundary-floodway maps and any revision thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. 
(C)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this article. 
(D)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(E)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(F)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements; shall be liberally constructed in favor of the governing body; and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(G)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Portland, Texas, or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 707, § 1, 1-2-85; Ord. No. 2144 , § 1, 11-1-16)

(5)  Notify adjacent communities and the Texas Water Development Board prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; 
(6)  Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished; 
(7)  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with section 4-32(B), the building official shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data available from a federal, state or other source in order to administer the provisions of section 4-34; and, 
(8)  Require until a regulatory floodway is designated that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) flood at any point within the community. 
(C)  Permit procedures: 
(1)  Application for a development permit shall be presented to the building official on forms furnished by him and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.

a.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed structures; 
b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure shall be floodproofed; 
c.  A certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure shall meet the floodproofing criteria of section 4-34(B)(2); 
d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or natural drainage will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
(2)  Approval or denial of a development permit by the building official shall be based on all of the provisions of this article and the following relevant factors: 
a.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
b.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
c.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
d.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
e.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
f.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
h.  The necessity to the facility of waterfront locations, where applicable; 
i.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; and 
j.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(D)  Variances procedures: 
(1)  The board of adjustment as established by the City of Portland, Texas, shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The board of adjustment shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(3)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(4)  The building official shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(6)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection (C)2. of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(7)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article. 
(8)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(9)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
a.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
b.  Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

The lien obtained by the city is security for the expenditures made and interest accruing at the rate of ten (10) percent on the amount due from the date of payment by the municipality. The lien is inferior only to tax liens and liens for street improvements. The city council may bring a suit for expenditures and interest due. The statement of expenses or a certified copy of the statement is prima facie proof of the expenses incurred by the municipality in doing the work or making the improvements. The city council may foreclose a lien on property under this article in a proceeding relating to the property brought under Subchapter E, Chapter 33, Tax Code or other applicable state law.

Sec. 41/2-4. - Franchise to operate required. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful to operate a cable television system within the city unless a valid franchise has first been obtained from the city pursuant to the terms of this chapter. A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall authorize the grantee to provide cable television services within the city and to charge subscribers for such services. It shall also authorize and permit the grantee to traverse any portion of the city in order to provide service outside the city. Unless otherwise specified, the franchise area shall be the legal boundaries of the city. 
(b)  Since franchises may have an adverse impact on the public rights-of-way, the city may issue a franchise only following a public hearing to consider the potential impact which the grant of a franchise may have on the community. In considering whether to grant one (1) or more franchises, the city shall consider the following issues: 
(1)  The positive and/or negative impact of a franchise on the community. 
(2)  The amount of time it will take the applicant to complete construction of the proposed system and activate service in the entire area to be served; and whether the applicant can complete construction and activation of its system in a timely manner. 
(3)  The financial capabilities of the applicant and its commitment to make the necessary investment to erect, maintain and operate the proposed cable TV system for the duration of the franchise term. 
(4)  The quality and technical reliability of the proposed system, based upon the applicant's plan of construction, the method of distribution of signals, and the applicant's technical qualifications to construct and operate such system.

(1)  Every applicant shall furnish to the city a map of suitable scale, showing all roads and public buildings, which indicates the areas to be served and the proposed dates of commencement of service for each area. The proposed service area shall be subject to approval by the city. If approved, the service area shall be incorporated into any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter. If no service area is specifically delineated in a franchise, it shall be considered to be the corporate boundaries of the city. 
(2)  After receiving a franchise application, the city shall examine the applicant's legal, financial, technical and character qualifications. Subject to the provisions of this section, the city may grant one (1) or more nonexclusive franchises creating a right to construct and operate a cable television system within the public ways of the city. 
(3)  In the event an application is filed which would service an area which overlaps, in whole or in part, an existing grantee's franchise area, the applicant shall provide a copy of the application, by registered or certified mail, to the existing grantee. Such notice shall be considered a condition precedent to consideration of the application by the city. 
(Ord. No. 936, § 3.2, 2-18-97) 
Sec. 41/2-6. - Franchise renewal procedures. 
    The grantor will insure that the franchise area receives upgrades to the cable system as needed and identified during the renewal procedure such that the system is maintained at or near current technology. The grantor will seek the maximum community involvement particularly in the needs assessment and performance review period. All franchises shall be renewed pursuant to this chapter and applicable federal law as specified in section 626, (47 U.S.C. 546) Franchise Renewal, in the Cable Act. The following outlined procedure is included as a working guide to the city for administration purposes and is not intended to replace the procedure as presented in section 626, (47 U.S.C. 546) in the Cable Act: 
(1)  Commencement of proceedings; public notice and participation. 
a.  The city may, on its own initiative during the six-month period which begins with the thirty-sixth month before the franchise expiration, commence a proceeding which affords the public in the franchise area appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of: 
1.  Identifying the future cable-related community needs and interests; and 
2.  Reviewing the performance of the cable operator under the franchise during the then-current franchise term. 
If the cable operator submits, during such six-month period, a written renewal notice requesting the commencement of such a proceeding, the franchising authority shall commence such a proceeding not later than six-months after the date such notice is submitted. 
b.  The cable operator may not invoke the renewal procedures set forth in subsections (2) through (6) of this section, unless: 
1.  Such a proceeding is requested by the cable operator by timely submission of such notice; or 
2.  Such a proceeding is commenced by the franchising authority on its own initiative. 
(2)  Submission of renewal proposals; contents; time. Upon completion of a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section, the cable operator seeking renewal of a franchise may, on its own initiative or at the request of the city, submit a proposal for renewal. The application for renewal shall contain such material as the city may require, including upgrade plans. Upgrades to the cable system shall be required as needed to maintain the system at or near current technology. The time table for such upgrades shall be included. The city may establish a date by which such proposal shall be submitted. 
(3)  Notice of proposal; renewal; preliminary assessment of nonrenewal; administrative review; notice and opportunity for hearing; written decision. 
a.  Upon submittal by the cable operator of a proposal to the city for renewal of the franchise, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the city shall provide prompt public notice of such proposal and, during the four-month period which begins on the date of the submission of the cable operator's proposal pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, renew the franchise or issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed and, at the request of the operator or on its own initiative, commence an administrative proceeding after providing prompt public notice of such proceeding, in accordance with subsection (3) b of this section to consider whether: 
1.  The cable operator has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law; 
2.  The quality of the operator's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix, quality of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in light of community needs; 
3.  The operator has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in the operator's proposal; and 
4.  The operator's proposal is reasonable and meets the future cable-related community needs and interest, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interest. 
b.  In any proceeding under subsection a, the cable operator shall be afforded adequate notice and the cable operator and the franchise authority, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under subsection (1) of this section), to require the production of evidence, and to questions witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding. 
c.  At the completion of the above proceeding, the city council shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the cable operator. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor. If the franchise is not renewed, the council may invite applications for prospective cable operators to serve the franchise area and a new cable operator shall be selected. The council shall provide for the acquisition of the assets of the former cable operator's cable television system by the new cable operator at fair market value. Selections of a new cable operator shall be undertaken in an expeditious manner and with a minimum disruption of service to subscribers. 
(4)  Basis for denial. Any denial of a proposal for renewal shall be based on one (1) or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in subsections 1. through 4. of subsection (3)a. of this section, pursuant to the record of the proceeding under subsection (3) of this section. The city council may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under subsection (3)a.1. of this section or on events considered under subsection (3)a.2. of this section unless the city has provided the operator with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case, in which it is documented that the city has waived its right to object, or the cable operator gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the city fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice. 
(5)  Judicial review; grounds for relief. Any cable operator whose proposal for renewal has been denied by a final decision of the city council made pursuant to this section, or has been adversely affected by a failure of the city to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section, may appeal such final decision or failure in any appropriate state or federal judicial or administrative forum pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of the United States Code ("USC") 47. The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds that: 
a.  Any action of the franchising authority, other than harmless errors, is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this section; or 
b.  In the event of a final decision of the franchising authority denying the renewal proposal, the operator has demonstrated that the adverse findings of the franchising authority with respect to each of the factors described in subsection (3)a.1. of this section on which the denial is based is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the proceeding conducted under subsection (3) of this section. 
(6)  Finality of administrative decision. Any decision of the city on a proposal for renewal shall not be considered final unless all proper administrative review has occurred or the opportunity therefor has lapsed. 
(7)  Franchise expiration defined. For purposes of this section, the term "franchise expiration" means the date of the expiration of the term of the franchise, as provided under the franchise, as it was in effect on the date of the enactment of this title. 
(8)  Alternative renewal procedures. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) through (7) of this section, a cable operator may submit a proposal for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to this subsection at any time, and a franchising authority may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal at any time, including after proceedings pursuant to this section have commenced. The provisions of subsections (1) through (7) of this section shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a proposal under this subsection. The denial of a renewal pursuant to this subsection shall not affect action on a renewal proposal that is submitted in accordance with subsections (1) through (7) of this section. 
(9)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) through (8), and lawful action to revoke a cable operator's franchise for cause shall not be negated by the subsequent initiation of renewal proceedings by the cable operator under this section.

Extension of annual reporting requirement of such period up to thirty (30) additional days may be granted by the city manager. 
(c)  The city shall have the right to audit the grantee's financial records, for the purpose of recomputing any amounts to be payable to the city under this chapter; provided, however, that such inspection shall take place within thirty-six (36) months following the receipt of such payment. Any additional amount due the city as a result of the audit made by the city shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee by the city of the amount due, and such notice shall include a copy of the audit report. The cost of such audit shall be borne by the grantee, if an additional amount in excess of five (5) percent of the franchise fees due for the audit period are found to be due to the city.

The twenty-four-hour period shall begin when the grantee has been notified by the subscriber.

If a request for an appeal hearing is not made within the ten-day period, the action of the director is final. 
(b)  The city administrator shall serve as hearing officer at an appeal hearing and consider evidence offered by interested persons.

A written request to the city council stays the action of the hearing officer in suspending a permit until the city council renders a final decision. 
(c)  If a request for an appeal hearing with the city council is filed within the ten-day period, the city council shall hear and consider evidence offered by any interested person. The formal rules of evidence do not apply to an appeal hearing before the city council. The city council shall decide the appeal on the basis of preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing. The city council shall affirm, reverse or modify the action of the hearing officer by a majority vote; failure to reach a majority decision on a motion shall leave the hearing officer's decision unchanged.

If such an arrangement is made, all other requirements of this article must be met. The financial institution shall execute a letter of agreement with the city permitting the installation of all necessary equipment on an indicator panel monitored in the communications division of the police department. The installation must be accomplished at the institution's expense. 
(b)  The financial institution, at its expense, shall make arrangements to provide service for the alarm system at the instance of the financial institution or the chief of police on twenty-four-hour basis, seven (7) days a week.

(g)  Seizure. If the magistrate determines that the noise producer is an "habitual noise nuisance producer" or that the location is an "habitual noise nuisance source", the habitual noise nuisance source or any other personal property used by the habitual noise nuisance producer may be immediately seized at the time of a subsequent violation of this article. At the time of such seizure, a written notice of the right to an immediate administrative hearing before a municipal court magistrate shall be issued to the habitual noise producer or owner or person in possession of the habitual noise nuisance source. The hearing shall be for the purpose of determining if a noise nuisance actually occurred on which the abatement officer based his seizure, and to voice any complaints about the manner of the seizure.

The request shall be submitted on forms made available by the office of the city engineer. Such letter of request must specify the proposed length and location of the portion of the street for which the study is requested, and must be signed by persons constituting at least fifty-one (51) percent of the property owners and owning at least fifty-one (51) percent of the property frontage involved in the requested improvement study.

Sec. 19-41. - Preliminary engineering study and report. 
(a)  Upon receipt of a properly filed letter of request, the city engineer shall initiate a preliminary engineering study to determine the minimum practical project for improvement of the street and the type of construction best suited for that particular project. The city engineer and city staff shall prepare a report setting forth the minimum street improvement project which the city will undertake for the street in question. Such report may require construction of improvements on a longer or shorter section of street than that proposed in the letter of request. Such report shall show the current record title owners, legal descriptions of properties, and the front footage of each lot abutting on the portion of the street for which improvements are proposed, and the amount of the assessment which shall be borne by each abutting property owner, as determined in accordance with the front foot plan or rule. Upon completion of the report, a copy of the report shall be forwarded to the designated representative of the persons submitting the letter of request. 
(b)  For purposes of preparing the preliminary engineering study and report, the city engineer's computation of assessments against the abutting property owners for street improvements shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  For platted property, the owners of property abutting upon the section of street to be improved shall be assessed the following amounts: 
a.  Construction of an asphalt street with curb and gutter -One-third ( 1/3 ) of current cost of construction per linear foot, as determined by the city engineer. 
b.  Construction of sidewalk -The entire current cost of construction per linear foot, as determined by the city engineer. 
c.  Construction of curb and gutter -The entire current cost of construction per linear foot, less any credit given for existing curb and gutter, as determined by the city engineer. 
d.  Construction or rebuilding of concrete driveway approaches -The entire current cost of construction per square yard, as determined by the city engineer. 
(2)  For unplatted property, regardless of the zoning classification, the owners of property abutting the section of street being improved shall pay the full cost of construction of all street improvements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, and concrete driveway approaches. 
    The above assessment calculations are not binding upon the city, and are intended solely for use in the preliminary engineering study. The assessments may be altered by the city council within the limits prescribed by applicable state law, after due consideration of the special benefits accruing to the abutting property owners, prior to final adoption of an assessment ordinance by city council.

The petition shall be filed with the city secretary, with a cash deposit equal to fifteen (15) percent of the total amount of the property owner assessments, as shown by the city engineer's calculations in the preliminary engineering study and report. The cash deposit shall include a statement of the name, address and amount given of each contributor to the cash deposit. In the event that the city council fails to approve the proposed improvement project within four (4) months of the submission of the petition, said deposit shall be refunded without interest to the individuals named as contributing to the deposit. In the event the city council approves a plan for the street improvements and levies assessments against the abutting property owners, the deposit shall be applied to the cost of construction, and individuals contributing to the deposit shall be credited for their respective contributions. The city shall have no duty to verify the accuracy of the statement accompanying the cash deposit, and may rely conclusively on such statement in refunding or crediting the cash deposit. 
(Ord. No. 754, § 1(19-32), 3-17-87)

This article establishes a sole-provider ambulance system because it is unreasonable to unnecessarily create high rates to make needed improvements to ambulance service within the City of Portland, when a more efficiently designed system can achieve the same results at lower cost. The most efficient design to achieve the goals of high-quality emergency and transfer ambulance service, at the lowest cost to the citizens, is through the implementation of a sole-provider ambulance system.

    Ambulance means any privately or publicly owned motor vehicle that is specially designed or constructed and equipped and is intended to be used for and is maintained or operated for the emergency or other transportation of patients. 
    Ambulance patient or patient means any person being transported in a wheelchair or in a reclining position within the City of Portland to or from health care facilities except when the transportation originates outside the City of Portland.

    Emergency medical services means the transportation of a patient in an ambulance within the City of Portland whether of an emergency nature, non-emergency transfer or otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 1170, § 2, 5-15-07) 
Sec. 22-53. - Authority to operate. 
(a)  No person, firm, corporation, partnership or other entity shall operate or cause to be operated an ambulance, nor shall such furnish, conduct, maintain, advertise or otherwise be engaged in the business or service of the transportation of ambulance patients, emergency or otherwise, within the City of Portland unless such person is the ambulance service contractor. No person shall knowingly solicit ambulance services as regulated herein except the ambulance service contractor. 
(b)  However, the prohibitions set forth in subsection (a) above, shall not be applicable to an ambulance or ambulance service provider(s): 
(1)  Which is rendering assistance to patients in the case of a major catastrophe emergency with which the ambulance service contractor's ambulances are insufficient or unable to cope; or

Sec. 23-73. - Water main line extensions. 
(a)  No user water service lines shall be used to connect a user to the main except where a main is within the area created by projecting perpendicular lines from the property corners of the user to be served onto an adjacent street right-of-way, alley right-of-way, or utility easement. If a main is not available immediately adjacent to the property to be served, the user must extend the main to a point within the area described above. All water main line extensions shall be solely at the cost of the user requiring the extension of the line. When the appropriate tap has been approved, a city service line shall be extended from the main to the user's property boundary to connect into the user's service line at the meter. 
(b)  No main shall be extended without being designed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Texas. This design must be approved and accepted by the city before construction can begin. The user requiring the service shall pay all costs associated with obtaining the design. 
(c)  The materials for the mains shall conform to all requirements established by the city. Though larger pipe may be required, in no case shall the pipe for any water main extension be less than six (6) inches (inside diameter), even when being extended from a smaller line, nor shall the materials be rated at less than two hundred (200) pounds per square inch working pressure. 
(d)  The city may stipulate locations where necessary peripheral equipment may be required, such as fire hydrants and valves, and the cost of these items shall also be borne by the user making the extension. Because of the extremely critical nature of certain items, such as fire hydrants, the city shall have the authority to specify the exact brands and models to be used. 
(e)  The city may require a main being extended to be over-sized (a larger diameter pipe than the diameter pipe normally required) to improve area service or accommodate future development. The city council may approve payment of the over-size (material only) when it deems it appropriate to do so. 
(Ord. No. 849, Art. 5, 11-11-92; Ord. No. 874, Art. 5, 8-17-93; Ord. No. 896, Art. V, 1-17-95; Ord. No. 991, § 1, 9-7-99) 
Sec. 23-74. - Sewer main line extensions. 
(a)  No user service lines shall be used to connect a user to the main except where a main is within the area created by projecting perpendicular lines from the property corners of the user to be served onto an adjacent street right-of-way, alley right-of-way, or utility easement. If a main is not available immediately adjacent to the property to be served, the user must extend the main to a point within the area described above. All sewer main line extensions shall be solely at the cost of the user requiring the extension of the line. The city shall, when the tap has been approved, provide an appropriate fitting to allow the user service line to be connected. 
(b)  No main shall be extended without being designed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Texas. This design must be approved and accepted by the city before construction can begin. The user requiring the service shall pay all costs associated with obtaining the design. 
(c)  The materials for the mains shall conform to all requirements established by the city. Though larger pipe may be required, in no case shall any sewer main extension be less than eight (8) inches (inside diameter), even when being extended from a smaller line, nor shall the pipe have a wall thickness that is thinner than a DR (or an SDR) of 26. DR 21 is preferred. 
(d)  The maximum distance allowed between manholes is five hundred (500) feet. All sewer lines must be designed and built with straight horizontal and vertical alignment. No curves will be allowed in either direction. Deflections (horizontal or vertical) will be allowed only at manholes. All extended lines must terminate with a manhole. In very unique circumstances, the city may allow for an extension to terminate with a cleanout, but this shall be done only in those cases where there would be absolutely no advantage to the city to require the manhole, and because of geographic constraints, no further extension of the line or service is physically possible. 
(e)  The city may require a main being extended to be over-sized (a larger diameter pipe than the diameter pipe normally required) to improve area service or accommodate future development. The city council may approve payment of the over-size (material only) when it deems it appropriate to do so.

(2)  The drought surcharge can be up to and including one hundred (100) percent of the most current water rate. 
(c)  Residential customers who are billed from a master water meter . 
(1)  A monthly water usage trigger point shall be three thousand (3,000) gallons for each residential unit. This trigger point is the maximum amount of water that a customer can use in a month before being charged a drought rate surcharge. 
(2)  The drought surcharge can be up to and including one hundred (100) percent of the most current water rate. 
(d)  Commercial or institutional customer . 
(1)  A monthly water usage allocation shall be established by the city manager or designee for each commercial or institutional customer. 
(2)  Method of establishing allocation . 
a.  During Stage 4, the commercial or institutional customer's allocation shall be ninety (90) percent of the customer's usage for the corresponding month's billing period during the previous twelve (12) months prior to the implementation of Stage 2 condition. 
b.  If the customer's billing history is shorter than twelve (12) months, the monthly average for the period for which there is a record shall be used for any monthly period for which no history exists. 
c.  Provided, however, a customer, ninety (90) percent of whose monthly usage is less than six thousand (6,000) gallons, shall be allocated six thousand (6,000) gallons. 
d.  The city manager shall give best effort to see that notice of each commercial or institutional customer's allocation is mailed to such customer. 
e.  If, however, the customer does not receive such notice, it shall be the customer's responsibility to contact the city' utilities billing office to determine the allocation, and the allocation shall be fully effective notwithstanding lack of receipt of written notice. 
f.  Upon request of the customer or at the initiative of the city manager, the allocation may be reduced or increased by the city manager, 
1.  If one (1) nonresidential customer agrees to transfer part of its allocation to another nonresidential customer, or 
2.  If other objective evidence demonstrates that the designated allocation is inaccurate under present conditions. 
(e)  Commercial, institutional, and industrial customers shall pay the following surcharges: 
(1)  Customers whose allocation is six thousand (6,000) gallons through twenty thousand (20,000) gallons per month: 
a.  Five dollars ($5.00) per one thousand (1,000) gallons for the first 1,000 gallons over allocation. 
b.  Eight dollars ($8.00) per one thousand (1,000) gallons for the second one thousand (1,000) gallons over allocation. 
c.  Sixteen dollars ($16.00) per one thousand (1,000) gallons for the third one thousand (1,000) gallons over allocation.

(2)  Customers whose allocation is twenty-one thousand (21,000) gallons per month or more: 
a.  One (1) times the block rate for each one thousand (1,000) gallons in excess of the allocation up through five (5) percent above allocation. 
b.  Three (3) times the block rate for each one thousand (1,000) gallons from 5 percent through ten (10) percent above allocation. 
c.  Five (5) times the block rate for each one thousand (1,000) gallons from 10 percent through fifteen (15) percent above allocation. 
d.  Ten (10) times the block rate for each one thousand (1,000) gallons more than fifteen (15) percent above allocation. 
e.  The surcharges shall be cumulative. 
f.  As used herein, "block rate" means the charge to the customer per 1,000 gallons at the regular water rate schedule at the level of the customer's allocation. 
(f)  Nonresidential customer is billed from a master meter. 
(1)  When a nonresidential customer is billed from a master meter which jointly measures water to multiple residential dwelling units (for example: apartments, mobile homes), the customer may pass along any surcharges assessed under this plan to the tenants or occupants, provided that: 
a.  The customer notifies each tenant in writing: 
1.  That the surcharge will be passed along.

(g)  Water service to the customer may be terminated under the following conditions: 
(1)  Monthly residential water usage exceeds allocation by four thousand (4,000) gallons or more two or more times (which need not be consecutive months). 
(2)  Monthly water usage on a master meter which jointly measures water usage to multiple residential dwelling units exceeds allocation by four thousand (4,000) gallons times the number of dwelling units or more two or more times (which need not be consecutive months). 
(3)  Monthly nonresidential water usage for a customer whose allocation is six thousand (6,000) gallons through twenty thousand (20,000) gallons exceeds its allocation by seven thousand (7,000) gallons or more two (2) or more times (which need not be consecutive months). 
(4)  Monthly nonresidential water usage for a customer whose allocation is twenty-one thousand (21,000) gallons or more exceeds its allocation by fifteen (15) percent or more two (2) or more times (which need not be consecutive months). 
(5)  For residential customers and nonresidential customers whose allocation does not exceed twenty thousand (20,000) gallons, after the first disconnection water service shall be restored upon request for a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(6)  For such customers, after the second disconnection, water service shall be restored within twenty-four (24) hours of the request for a fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
(7)  If water service is disconnected a third time for such customer, water service shall not be restored until the city re-enters a level of water conservation less than Stage 3. For master meter customers, the service restoration fees shall be the same as above times the number of dwelling units. 
(8)  For nonresidential customers whose allocation is twenty-one thousand (21,000) gallons per month or more: 
a.  After the first disconnection, water service shall be restored upon request for a fee in the amount of "X" in the following formula: 
X = $50.00 × Customer's Allocation in gallons / 20,000 gallons 
b.  After the second disconnection for said customers, water service shall be restored within twenty-four (24) hours of the request for a fee of ten (10) times "X". 
c.  If water service is disconnected a third time for such customer, water service shall not be restored until the city re-enters a level of water conservation less than Stage 3. 
d.  The city manager is directed to institute written guidelines for disconnection of water service under this provision, which will satisfy minimum due process requirements, if any. 
(h)  It shall be a defense to imposition of a surcharge hereunder, or to termination of service, that water used over allocation resulted from loss of water through no fault of the customer (for example, a major water line break) for the following conditions: 
(1)  The customer shall have the burden to prove such defense by objective evidence (for example, a written certification of the circumstances by a plumber). 
(2)  A sworn statement may be required of the customer. 
(3)  This defense shall not apply if the customer failed to take reasonable steps for upkeep of the plumbing system, failed to reasonably inspect the system and discover the leak, failed to take immediate steps to correct the leak after discovered, or was in any other way negligent in causing or permitting the loss of water. 
(i)  When this section refers to allocation or water usage periods as "month," monthly," "billing period," and the like, such references shall mean the period in the city's ordinary billing cycle which commences with the reading of a meter one (1) month and commences with the next reading of that meter which is usually the next month. 
(1)  The goal for the length of such period is thirty (30) days, but a variance of five (5) days, more or less, will necessarily exist as to particular meters. 
(2)  If the meter reader system is prevented from timely reading a meter by any obstacle which is attributable to the customer, the original allocation shall apply to the longer period without modification.

(Ord. No. 388, § 3, 6-1-71) 
Sec. 23-174. - Control of admissible wastes. 
(a)  Permit. Within twenty (20) days after passage of this article, any person desiring to deposit or discharge any industrial waste mixture into the sewers or sewer works of the city, or any sewer connected therewith, or who is now so doing, shall make application to the approving authority for a permit therefor upon application forms to be obtained from him. 
(b)  Control chambers. Within six (6) months from the date of passage of this article, any person discharging or desiring to discharge an industrial waste mixture into the sewers or sewer works of the city, or any sewer connected therewith, shall provide and maintain in a suitable, accessible position on his premises, or such premises occupied by him, an inspection chamber or manhole near the outlet of each sewer, drain, pipe, channel, or connection which communicates with any sewer or sewer works of the city or any sewer connected therewith. Each such manhole or inspection chamber shall be of such design and construction which will prevent infiltration by ground and surface waters or introduction of slugs or solids by installation of screens with maximum openings of one (1) inch, but of such sufficient fineness to prevent the entrance of objectionable slugs or solids to the sanitary sewage system and shall be so maintained by persons discharging wastes so that any authorized representative or employee of the city may readily and safely measure the volume and obtain samples of the flow at all times. Plans for the construction of control manholes or inspection chambers, including such flow measuring devices as may or may not be required, shall be approved by the approving authority prior to the beginning of construction. 
(c)  Measurement of flow. The water consumption during the previous month, as determined from the meter records of the water department, shall be the valid basis for computing the sewage flow, unless actual sewage flow is measured by a recording meter of a type approved by the approving authority. The persons shall install and maintain such device in proper condition to accurately measure such flow. Upon failure to do so, the water consumption shall be the basis for charges. 
    When water is contained in a product or is evaporated or is discharged as unpolluted waste in an uncontaminated condition to surface drainage, an application may be made for a reduction in the volume of waste discharged to the public sewer, provided supporting data satisfactory to the approving authority is furnished. This data shall include a flow diagram, destination of water supply and/or waste, supported by submetering data installed on such process piping at the expense of the person. 
(d)  Sampling of wastes. Sampling of the effluent of waste discharges may be accomplished manually or by the use of mechanical equipment to obtain a composite sample which would be representative of the total effluent. Samples shall be taken at such intervals as determined by the approving authority as necessary to maintain a control over the discharges from the establishment. The method used in the examination of all bacteriological wastes to determine suspended solids, B.O.D. and prohibited wastes shall be those set forth in section 23-171. 
(Ord. No. 388, § 4, 6-1-71) 
Sec. 23-175. - Protection from damage. 
(a)  No unauthorized person shall maliciously, wilfully or negligibly break, damage, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenances or equipment which is part of the municipal sewage works. Any person violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct. 
(Ord. No. 388, § 5, 6-1-71) 
Sec. 23-176. - Surcharge for wastes of abnormal strength. 
(a)  The sewage service charge for any person, firm, owner or corporation discharging waste into the system is based on the current rate schedule, provided that the city meter is the only source of water used by the owner, and provided that the B.O.D. or the suspended solids in the waste water does not exceed the normal concentration of three hundred (300) parts per million. In those cases where the owner uses water other than city water, then said owner shall be required to install at his own expense a city water meter to measure the volume of water used. The sewage service charge will be computed by the city manager using the basic city sewerage service rates. 
(b)  When the total concentration of the B.O.D. and the suspended solids added together exceed six hundred (600) parts per million at the point entering the city's system, a surcharge shall be applied to the base sewage service. The surcharge shall be based on dividing the sum of the actual B.O.D. and suspended solids by six hundred (600) to get the factor that the discharging waste exceeds the normal concentration. 
    The city manager shall use this factor in addition to the actual volume of discharged waste, to determine the surcharge, which is additive to the basic sewage service charge. 
(c)  The determination of B.O.D. and suspended solids shall be by an independent laboratory selected by the city. 
(d)  Samples shall be taken in accordance with the provisions covered under section 23-174(d) of this article. 
(e)  When any such tests made at the discretion of the city shows that a surcharge shall be applied, continued or increased over the base rate, whichever is applicable, then the owner shall pay the actual cost for each test, which shall include sampling, mailing and handling, and the laboratory fees. When a surcharge is in effect, a test will be made at least once each thirty (30) days. When such tests made at the discretion of the city reveals that the surcharge is no longer applicable, then no costs will be made to the owner for such test or tests. 
(Ord. No. 388, § 6, 6-1-71) 
Sec. 23-177. - Billing. 
(a)  Industrial waste surcharges provided for in this article shall be included as a separate item on the regular bill for water and sewer charges and shall be paid monthly in accordance with the existing practices. Surcharges shall be paid at the same time that the water, sewer and sanitation charges of the person become due and payment for water, sewer and sanitation services shall not be accepted without payment also of sewer service charges and surcharges. 
(Ord. No. 388, § 7, 6-1-71) 
Sec. 23-178. - Penalty for failure to pay bills. 
(a)  Failure to pay monthly bills for water and/or sanitary sewer services when due, or failure to pay the established sewer charge for industrial wastes when due, or repeated discharge of prohibited waste to the sanitary sewer, shall be sufficient cause to disconnect any and all services to the water and/or sanitary sewer mains of the City of Portland, and the same penalties and charges now or hereafter provided for by the ordinances of the City of Portland for failure to pay the bill for water service when due shall be applicable in like manner in the case of failure to pay the established surcharge for industrial waste discharged to the sanitary sewer mains. 
(Ord. No. 388, § 8, 6-1-71) 
Sec. 23-179. - Powers and authority of enforcing agents. 
(a)  The approving authority bearing credentials and identification shall be permitted to gain access to such properties as may be necessary for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing, in accordance with provisions of these regulations. Any person found to be violating any provision of this article shall be served by the city with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit shall be guilty of violation of the service contract and shall be summarily disconnected from the sanitary sewer and/or water service. Such disconnection and reconnection would be at the total expense of the customer. 
(b)  Where acids and chemicals, damaging to sewer lines or treatment processes are released to the sewer causing rapid deterioration of these structures, or interfering with proper treatment of sewage, the approving authority is authorized to immediately terminate services by such measures as are necessary to protect the facilities. 
(Ord. No. 388, § 9, 6-1-71) 
Sec. 23-180. - Penalties. 
(a)  If any person, firm or corporation shall violate any of the provisions of this article, they shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction in the Corporation Court, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each offense. Each day of such violation shall be deemed a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 388, § 10, 6-1-71) 
Sec. 23-181. - Nonwaiver. 
(a)  The failure on the part of the city to enforce any section, clause, sentence or provision of this article shall not constitute a waiver of the right of the city to later enforce any section, clause, sentence or provision of this article.

Sec. 312. - Variances. 
A.  Who May Request a Variance. Any applicant may request a variance to the strict interpretation of this Ordinance. 
B.  Hearing and Action by Zoning Board of Adjustment. After due notice, the Board of Adjustment shall hold a public hearing on an application for a variance. At the public hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the application, the relevant support materials and the public testimony given at the public hearing in light of the criteria below. After the close of the public hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall vote to approve, approve with conditions or deny the application for a variance, pursuant to the criteria below. (Also see Section 203.C.4). 
C.  Allowed Variances. In exercising its authority to grant a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall affirmatively find that one or more of the following circumstances applies. 
1.  Special circumstances resulting in unnecessary hardship. A variance may be granted where special circumstances exist on the property related to the size, shape, area, topography, surrounding conditions or location that do not generally apply to other property in the same zoning district, and that the circumstances are such that strict application of this Ordinance would create an unnecessary hardship or deprive the applicant of reasonable use of the land or building. 
2.  Overriding Public Interest. A variance may be granted if it addresses a recognized community concern or promotes an overriding public interest, including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Preserving the natural environment; or 
b.  Promoting maintenance or reuse of older urban or historic buildings. 
3.  Equity. A variance may be granted to permit modifications of height or setback regulations as may be needed to secure equity in the development of a parcel of land where it has been demonstrated that, due to the existence of legally nonconforming structures, a substantial proportion of the other properties in the same area and zoning district are legally enjoying the conditions that the applicant is requesting. 
4.  Literal Enforcement. A variance may be granted if it is found that the literal enforcement and strict application of this Ordinance will result in extraordinary circumstances inconsistent with the general provisions and intent of this Ordinance, and that, in granting the variance, the spirit of the ordinance will be preserved and substantial justice done. The Board of Adjustment shall state in their minutes the nature of the circumstance that justifies the variance. 
D.  Variances Not Allowed. In exercising its authority, the Board of Adjustment shall not grant a variance that would create any of the following effects: 
1.  The effect of the variance on the specific property would adversely affect the land use pattern as outlined by any City land use plan or policy. 
2.  The variance would be a material detriment to the public welfare or create injury to the use, enjoyment or value of property in the vicinity. 
3.  The variance is not the minimum variance that will relieve the proven hardship. 
4.  The variance would allow a use not allowed in the use table for the district in which the parcel is located. 
5.  The variance will relieve the applicant of conditions or circumstances that are caused by the illegal subdivision of land after the effective date of the subdivision regulations of this Ordinance, which subdivision of land caused the property to be unusable for any reasonable development under the existing regulations. 
6.  The variance will relieve the applicant of conditions or circumstances that are self-imposed. 
7.  The variance is grounded solely upon the opportunity to make the property more profitable or to reduce expense to the owner. 
8.  The variance will modify any condition imposed by the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council as part of a conditional use or special use review. 
9.  The variance would not only affect a specific parcel, but would be of such general nature as to constitute, in effect, a change in zoning of the parcel or a larger area, or would merit an amendment to this Ordinance. 
E.  Variance Criteria. To approve an application for a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall make an affirmative finding that each and every one of the following criteria are met. 
1.  Special circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land or structure that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same zoning district and are not merely financial. 
2.  These special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant. 
3.  Literal interpretation and enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other land in the same zoning district, and would cause an unnecessary and undue hardship. 
4.  Granting the variance is the minimum action that will make possible the use of the land or structure which is not contrary to the public interest, and would carry out the spirit of this Ordinance and substantial justice. 
5.  Granting the variance will not adversely affect adjacent land in a material way. 
6.  Granting the variance will be generally consistent with the purposes and intent of this Ordinance. 
F.  Conditions. The Board of Adjustment may impose such conditions on a variance as are necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Ordinance, to prevent or minimize adverse impacts upon the public and neighborhoods, and to ensure compatibility of the site with its surroundings. These conditions may include but are not limited to limitations on size, bulk and location; standards for landscaping, buffering and screening, lighting and adequate ingress and egress; cash deposits, bonds and other guarantees of deposit; other on-site improvements; and limitations on the duration or hours of operation of an allowed use. 
G.  Effect of Variance. 
1.  Issuance of a variance shall authorize only the particular variation which is approved in the variance. A variance shall run with the land. 
2.  Unless otherwise specified in the variance, an application to commence construction of the improvements that were the subject of the variance request must be applied for and approved within twelve (12) months of the date of the approval of the variance; otherwise, the variance shall automatically become null and void. Permitted time frames do not change with successive owners. Upon written request, only one extension of the twelve (12) month period may be granted by the Administrative Officer if it is determined that conditions of the site and immediately surrounding area are substantially unchanged. 
(Ord. No. 1001, § 1, 12-21-99; Ord. No. 1140, § 1, 1-17-06; Ord. No. 2065, § 1, 2-5-13) 
Note- See the editor's note to § 310. 
Sec. 313. - Special Exceptions. 
A.  Purpose. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to hear and decide special exceptions to the zoning regulations that are not permitted by right in a particular district because of potential adverse effect, but which if controlled in the particular instance as to its relationship to the neighborhood and to the general welfare, may be permitted where specifically authorized by subsection D. below, and in accordance with the substantive and procedural standards of this Ordinance. 
B.  Special Exceptions Defined. A special exception is differentiated from a variance by the following: 
1.  No Hardship Required. A special exception does not require a finding of a hardship. 
2.  Specifically Allowed. Approval of a special exception by the Board is allowed only as specifically provided for and defined in these regulations. 
C.  Requests for a Special Exception. The Board may consider a special exception to the provisions of subsection D. below upon written request of the property owner.

Every plat shall conform to the appropriate regulations applicable at the time of final approval, except that any final plat that has received preliminary approval shall be exempt from any subsequent amendments to this section rendering the plat nonconforming as to bulk or use; provided that final approval is obtained as outlined in this paragraph D. 
E.  Financial Guarantees for Improvements. 
1.  Applicability. If an adequate public or non-public water system or wastewater facility is not available from the City or another entity, or are not constructed by the subdivider, to serve lots intended for residential purposes of five (5) acres or less at the time final plat approval is sought, then the City shall require the owner of the subdivided tract to execute an agreement with the City secured by a bond or other alternative financial guarantees such as a cash deposit or a letter of credit.

Such bonds shall meet the criteria contained in the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Treasury. 
d.  The bond shall be conditioned upon construction or installation of water and wastewater facilities meeting the criteria established by Chapter 6. Subdivision Design and Improvements and upon construction of facilities within the time stated on the plat, or on the document attached to the plat for the subdivision, or within any extension of time granted by the City. 
3.  Letter of Credit. A letter of credit shall meet the following requirements:

4.  Financial Guarantee. The City will determine the amount of the bond, letter of credit, or cash deposit required to ensure proper construction of adequate water and wastewater facilities in the subdivision.

a.  The property being subdivided lies wholly within the jurisdiction of the county; 
b.  The property being subdivided lies wholly within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality; and 
c.  The City has executed an interlocal agreement with the County that imposes the obligation on the County to:

iii.  Assume the obligations to enforce the terms of the financial guarantee under the conditions set forth therein and complete construction of the facilities identified in the construction agreement. 
F.  Signing and Recording of Final Plat. 
1.  Signing. When installation of improvements is required, the Chairman of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Administrative Official shall endorse approval on the plat only after all conditions of the approval have been satisfied and all improvements satisfactorily completed or a guarantee for their improvement has been accepted by the City. There shall be written evidence that the required public facilities have been installed or guaranteed in a manner satisfactory to the City provided by the developer's engineer and approved by the City Engineer. 
2.  Recording. 
a.  The Chairman and the Administrative Official shall sign the original of the subdivision plat. The applicant shall then record said plat with the County Clerk. 
b.  No building permits shall be issued until the final recorded plat has been provided to the City in a format and quantity as determined by the Administrative Official. 
c.  There shall be compliance with all requirements of this section and applicable Texas laws. 
G.  Sectionalizing or Phasing. Prior to granting approval of a subdivision plat, the Planning and Zoning Commission may permit the plat to be divided into two (2) or more sections to assure the orderly development of the plat. In the event of approval of sectionalizing, the entire subdivision preliminary plat, including all sections, shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning Commission for preliminary plat approval. The final plat may contain one (1) or more of the approved sections for the Planning and Zoning Commission's consideration. A final plat for the subsequent phase shall be submitted within twenty-four (24) months from the date that the preceding plat was recorded. Additional extensions may be requested in writing by the developer (see paragraph C.5 above). Written approval may be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
H.  Aggregation of Platted Lots. When multiple platted lots from an existing subdivision are aggregated for the purpose of constructing a single building or project, an amended plat or replat shall not be required where no modification of any easement or right-of-way is involved. This exception shall not be construed as a waiver of any other requirement of this section, or of any recorded restrictions. The integrated tract shall thereafter be considered as a single lot for the purposes of this section. (For an integrated tract to be considered as a single lot without platting it as such, a structure must be placed over all interior lot lines or must maintain the minimum setback from any interior lot line that the structure is not built over.) 
I.  Amended Plats. Amended plats, as described in paragraph A above, may (at the discretion of the Administrative Official) be approved administratively. Where a plat amendment entails significant discretionary decision-making, the Administrative Official shall forward it for review at the next regularly scheduled Planning and Zoning Commission meeting in accordance with the provisions for a Final Plat. All plat amendments shall be conducted as follows. 
1.  Owner representation. An application for approval of a plat shall be filed by the record owner of the property to be subdivided or the duly authorized agent of the record owner. Applications to amend a plat shall be filled out on forms provided by the City for that purpose, be accompanied by the appropriate fees, and include the following: 
a.  A property deed along with a surveyor's detailed drawing of each adjoining property owner's lot or parcel of land so affected. 
b.  Each deed shall describe all ownership of acquired property. 
c.  The survey shall show all new boundaries of the plat, along with the boundaries of all of the affected lots, including previous lot lines. 
2.  The application for a plat amendment shall be reviewed by City Staff as to compliance with all applicable City codes and ordinances. If in compliance, the application shall be signed by any affected property owners, the City Manager or designee and notarized before the City Secretary. 
3.  Recording of said documents shall follow procedures outlined under subsection F.2. above, excluding the Chairman's signature requirement. 
4.  The adjusted property boundaries shall be so noted on the Official Zoning Map of the City. 
J.  Prerequisites to Approval. Final plat approval shall not be granted unless the subdivider has accomplished the following: 
1.  Dedicated the sites for the adequate water and wastewater treatment facilities to the appropriate political subdivision or investor-owned utility responsible for operation and maintenance of the facilities; and provided evidence that the water facilities and wastewater facilities have been constructed and maintained in accordance with the criteria established within these rules and the approvals from the Texas Health Department and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, as appropriate, of the plans and specifications for such construction, including any change orders filed with these agencies; or 
2.  Obtained all necessary permits for the proposed water facilities and wastewater facilities and has entered into a financial agreement with the City secured by a bond or other alternative financial guarantee such as a cash deposit or letter of credit for the provision of water and sewerage facilities with the bond or financial guarantee meeting the criteria established in subsection E. above. 
K.  Time Extensions for Providing Facilities. 
1.  Reasonableness. The City may extend, beyond the date specified on the plat or on the document attached to the plat, the date by which the required water and sewer service facilities must be fully operable if: 
a.  Any financial guarantees provided with the final plat as originally submitted are effective for the time of the requested extension or new financial guarantees that comply with subsection E. above are submitted which will be effective for the period of the extension; and 
b.  The City finds the extension is reasonable and not contrary to the public interest. 
2.  Timeliness. If the facilities are fully operable before the expiration of the extension period, the facilities are considered to have been made fully operable in a timely manner. 
3.  Unreasonableness. An extension is not reasonable if it would allow a residence in the subdivision to be inhabited without water or sewer services that meet the standards of Chapter 6. Subdivision Design and Improvements. 
L.  Maintenance Bond and Performance Bond. The contractor or developer shall provide a one-year maintenance bond and performance bond (or similar instruments as approved by the City Engineer) on all construction required by the final plat and construction drawings. The bonds shall be in an amount equal to one hundred (100) percent of the construction costs, or a lesser amount set by the Administrative Official. In no event shall the maintenance bond be reduced to an amount less than twenty-five (25) percent of the construction costs. This one-year period shall begin upon final acceptance of all improvements by the City. Any defects in materials or workmanship shall be corrected to satisfy the City during this period. 
M.  Administration. The Planning and Zoning Commission of the City shall administer the regulations and the process associated with this Section. 
1.  Variations and Exceptions. Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development of unusual conditions that the strict enforcement of the regulations would entail practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Planning and Zoning Commission, after public hearing and after report by staff, may vary or modify the proposed subdivision in such a way that the subdivider is allowed to develop their property in a reasonable manner, but at the same time, the public welfare and interest of the city and San Patricio County are protected and the general intent and spirit of the regulations preserved. 
2.  Transfer or Sale of Land. No person owning land composing a subdivision, nor his or her agent, shall transfer or sell or contract for the transfer or sale any lot or parcel of land located within such subdivision by reference to, or exhibition of, or by any other use of a plat of such subdivision, before such final plat has been approved, filed and recorded as provided in this section. The description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in any contract or instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring same shall not exempt such owner or agent from the penalties provided herein. 
N.  Construction in the Subdivision. 
1.  Construction of Public Improvements. Prior to the installation of any improvements, the developer shall obtain written approval from the city manager or designee. This approval shall authorize the construction of only those improvements contained with the subdivision construction plans, with the exception of utilities such as electric, gas, cable and telephone that are not required as part of the construction plans. Upon completion of the installation of any or all improvements, the city manager or designee shall file notification in the city files that the installation has been inspected and it is in compliance with the approved improvement plans, as far as he is able to determine. This shall not relieve the developer of his responsibility in cases of improper or faulty construction, substitution of inferior materials, or unapproved deviations from the improvement plans as approved by the city. 
2.  Building Permits. No building or occupancy permit shall be issued for any lot hereafter platted unless such plat has been approved, filed and recorded in accordance with the requirements of this section. Exceptions are as follows: 
a.  In a subdivision where completion of improvements is required, the city may permit construction of model homes in a portion of the subdivision involving up to twenty-five (25) percent of the total lots within each subdivision or phase. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until final plat recording. Adequate access into the development for the model home(s), including police and fire equipment, shall be completed prior to the issuance of any building permit. 
O.  Enforcement. 
1.  No deed or other instrument of transfer of real property in the Planning Area shall be accepted by the County Clerk for record unless said deed or instrument of transfer is for a lot or other platted area recorded or accompanied by a plat approved by the city, unless expressly exempted in Section 212.004, Texas Local Government Code, or as amended. 
2.  The city shall have the authority to inspect subdivision improvements within the Planning Area. Such inspection shall be facilitated through the administrative official or any other person designated by the city manager. 
P.  Appeals. To appeal a decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission or city council to deny a request for plat approval, the applicant must file a written request with the city within fifteen (15) days of such decision to have a hearing before the appropriate authority as stipulated below: 
1.  To appeal a decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Appeal shall be made before the city council. 
2.  To appeal a decision of the city council. After a period of six (6) months from an original appeal, a one-time appeal may be made again before the city council, in which case such decision shall be final. Any subsequent appeal may be made before a court of law. 
3.  Variations and Exceptions. See subsection M.1 above for variations and exceptions. 
Q.  Vacation of Plats. The city may from time to time vacate recorded plats in accordance with the rules and regulations of this section, the City Charter and State Statutes.

1b.  Amusement Redemption Machine: Included in the foregoing, an amusement redemption machine is any electronic, electromechanical, or mechanical contrivance designed, made, and adapted solely for bona fide amusement purposes if the contrivance rewards the player exclusively with noncash merchandise, prizes, or novelties, or a representation of value redeemable for those items, that have a wholesale value available from a single play of the game or device of not more than ten (10) times the amount charged to play the game or device once or five dollars ($5.00), whichever is less. 
2.  Coin-Operated Machine: A coin-operated machine includes a machine or device operated by the payment or insertion of paper currency or any other consideration.

CHAPTER 6. - SUBDIVISION DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 601. - Purpose. 
    The regulations of this Chapter have been developed in accordance with a comprehensive land use planning program to establish standards for the platting of land, plus design standards for existing and future public facility improvements relating to both public and private land use, transportation and the development of capital improvements. 
(Ord. No. 1001, § 1, 12-21-99) 
Sec. 602. - Conditions. 
    The subdivision of land is a process conferred upon the developer by the laws of the State of Texas and through these subdivision regulations. It is the developer who is seeking to acquire the advantages of lot subdivision and upon him rests the duty of compliance with reasonable requirements established by the Planning and Zoning Commission for the design, dedication, improvement and restrictive use of the land so as to provide for the general welfare of both current and future lot owners in the subdivision and the community at large. 
(Ord. No. 1001, § 1, 12-21-99) 
Sec. 603. - Annexation. 
    Owners of subdivision developments that are approved for development within the City's extra-territorial jurisdiction and are adjacent to the City's corporate limits, may be required to make agreement with the City to annex with final plat approval if such subdivision meets all applicable state laws regarding annexation. 
(Ord. No. 1001, § 1, 12-21-99) 
Sec. 604. - Planned Unit Developments. 
    Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) are governed by the provisions of this Ordinance, including Section 316, Planned Unit Development (PUD), and Section 317, Subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 1001, § 1, 12-21-99; Ord. No. 2065, § 1, 2-5-13) 
Sec. 605. - Design Requirements and Standards. 
    The arrangement of streets, lots and infrastructure shall give due regard to the topography and other physical features of the property, shall be prepared in accordance with accepted engineering principles, and shall meet the following requirements and standards. 
(Ord. No. 1001, § 1, 12-21-99) 
Sec. 606. - Lot Standards. 
A.  Lot Dimensions . Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of this Ordinance for the district being platted. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines or radii to curving street lines. Flag lots shall be prohibited in the R-2, R-6, R-7, R-8, R-8D, R-15, RMH, R-20 and RST districts. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing the minimum setback from both streets, i.e. wider by the footage differential between side yard setbacks for corner lots versus interior lots. Depth and width of non-residential lots shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking facilities and other site plan requirements. 
B.  Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided unless such lots are necessary for the development of the subdivision or are required by the City. 
C.  Access. All lots shall front directly upon a dedicated City street or private street. Single-family and duplex residential lots shall not have curb cuts directly on an arterial street. Additional access restrictions may be required to be specified on the plat. 
D.  Water bodies. If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots unless a homeowners association is to be responsible. In the latter case, the mean high water line shall be the property line. The City may, in special cases, accept dedication of the water body. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure with a design approved by the City. In no case shall a water body be included in meeting the minimum lot size or in calculating maximum density. 
E.  Bluffs. No bluff or steeply sloped lot shall be subdivided without an approved soil stabilization plan, deed restrictions that ensure the plan will be implemented as well as maintained and a recorded City disclaimer. The City may require whatever methods it deems necessary to minimize soil erosion on the lot being subdivided or adjacent lots. 
(Ord. No. 1001, § 1, 12-21-99; Ord. No. 1134, § 1, 10-4-05; Ord. No. 2094 , § 9, 10-7-14) 
Sec. 607. - Street Standards. 
A.  Subdivision Frontage on Improved Streets. 
1.  No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided has frontage on and access from an existing street meeting the following criteria: 
a.  An existing state, or county road; or 
b.  A City-maintained street which meets City standards. 
2.  Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize existing street frontage, such street shall be suitably improved as provided herein. 
B.  Grading and Improvement Plan. All streets within or adjacent to the proposed subdivision as well as those off-site streets required to be improved as a part of the subdivision, shall be graded, paved, and improved to conform to the City of Portland Street Construction Specifications (adopted by separate ordinance), and shall be approved as to design and specification by the City. 
C.  Topography and Arrangement. 
1.  Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Loop streets are encouraged. All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain building sites which are above the grade of the streets. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided. 
2.  All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing thoroughfares, dedicated rights-of-way and proposed systems as established in the Comprehensive Plan. 
3.  Minor or local streets shall be laid out to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to yield the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property. 
4.  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions. 
D.  Access to Arterial and Collectors. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector, the City may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means for provision of lot access: 
1.  Reverse Frontage. The lots shall back onto the arterial or collector and front on a parallel street. No individual access shall be provided from the arterial or collector. In the case of residential lots, screening in one of the following forms shall be required. 
a.  An opaque fence with masonry columns six (6) to eight (8) feet in height and palm trees with a minimum crown height of eight (8) feet installed every thirty (30) feet outside the fence in the street right-of-way; or, 
b.  A fired brick or natural stone wall six (6) to eight (8) feet in height and trees with a minimum caliper of three (3) inches at breast height installed every twenty-five (25) linear feet outside the fence in the street right-of-way. 
2.  Right Angle Streets. A series of cul-de-sacs or loop streets entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a street, with the side lines of their terminal lots on the arterial or collector. 

3.  Marginal Access. A marginal access street may be separated from the main street by a curbed median or other City approved physical barrier of no less than ten (10) feet wide, as measured inside back-of-curb to back-of-curb and having access thereto at suitable points. 

E.  Street Names. Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other street names in the City and within the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) so as not to cause confusion. A street that is, or is planned as, a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same name. 
F.  Street Signs, Markers and Traffic Control Devices. The applicant shall furnish and install street signs and traffic control devices required by the City at all road intersections. All street signs shall be installed prior to acceptance of the streets. All regulatory signs are to be placed at all intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which shall be approved by the City. 
G.  Construction of Streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties, unless otherwise set out in the City Comprehensive Plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must temporarily be a dead-end street, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary circular easement may be required on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that the easement outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued. No platted lot can front on such a temporary turnabout. 
H.  Dead-End Streets (Cul-de-Sacs). Where a road does not extend to the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the City for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than fifty (50) feet. However, the City may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with City standards and specifications. The right-of-way for a cul-de-sac turnaround shall be a minimum of one hundred (100) feet in width, with a pavement diameter of eighty (80) feet and a center island diameter (if required) of twenty-five (25) feet. In no case shall the pavement width be less than the width of the connecting paved surface. Maximum length of a dead-end or cul-de-sac street shall be five hundred (500) feet. 
I.  Turn Lanes, Widening, Shifting, Medians, and Striping. In addition to the pavement widths specified below, the City may require intersection turn lanes (right and/or left) and acceleration/deceleration lanes should traffic projections dictate. Such lane widths shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the City. The City may require that a street be widened, lanes to be shifted, medians constructed, or a roadway restriped if the proposed subdivision or building project generates unique traffic characteristics that present safety concerns. Such safety improvements shall be determined solely by the Administrative Official. 
J.  Surface Improvements. After utilities have been installed, the developer shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface roadways to the widths prescribed in these regulations. All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds, and sidewalks shall conform to the city construction standards and specifications (which are contained in a separate chapter), and shall be incorporated into the construction plans to be submitted for plat approval. A geotechnical report with pavement recommendations is required for the construction of road pavement. A boring plan shall be designed by a Professional Engineer licensed by the State of Texas for approval by the Administrative Official. All cul-de-sacs and all streets with residential lot frontage with horizontal curvature exceeding forty-five (45) degrees shall be concrete with a pavement section designed utilizing the geotechnical report's pavement recommendations. 
K.  Design Standards for Streets. The following street design standards are further illustrated in Chapter 3, Thoroughfares, of the City's 2012 Comprehensive Plan.

L.  Alleys. Alleys are not required for residential neighborhoods, however, when provided their rights-of-way must not be less than twenty (20) feet in width. Alleys must be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except that the Planning and Zoning Commission may waive this requirement where other provisions are made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the use proposed. Alley right-of-ways serving commercial and industrial areas must not be less than thirty (30) feet wide. 
M.  Alignment. Horizontal curves shall be used for all changes in direction. All streets to be established in a subdivision shall be designed in accordance with paragraph K above. 
N.  Angles. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than eighty (80) degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom. Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point. 
O.  Intersections. Offset intersections less than two hundred (200) feet shall not be allowed. Street jogs with centerline off-sets of less than two hundred (200) feet shall not be permitted except where the intersected street has separated lanes without median breaks at either intersection. Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. 
P.  Block Length. The maximum length of a block shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet. 
Q.  Curb Radius. Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two streets shall be as set out in paragraph K above. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignments within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement. 
R.  Elevation. Centerline of streets shall be at or above the base flood elevation (BFE) as indicated on the 100-year flood map, and as approved by the San Patricio Drainage District. 
S.  Grade. Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical. In areas of high relief, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having no greater than a two (2) percent rate at a distance of sixty (60) feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street. 
T.  Sight Distance. Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (excluding singular trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way in accordance with the requirements of the "Vision Triangle" as defined herein (see Chapter 10). 
U.  Widening and Realignment of Existing Streets. Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when the Comprehensive Plan or setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening of streets that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate, at his or her expense, the areas for widening or realignment of such streets. These streets shall be improved and dedicated to the full width as required by this Ordinance and the City's street standards. 
V.  New Collector or Arterial. 
1.  Where the development depends on a new arterial or collector for the efficient development of the subdivision, the developer shall dedicate and improve the street at his own expense in accordance with this Ordinance. 
2.  Where such a new street is planned to be built in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan by the City or State, the City may waive the requirement for the paving of that street if there is not demonstrable need for the street by the subdivision being developed.

    Any lot of record and separately owned at the time of passage of this Ordinance having less area or width than herein required may be used only for a single-family dwelling, or any of the nonresidential uses permitted in the district in which the lot is located. 
(Ord. No. 1001, § 1, 12-21-99) 
Sec. 802. - Nonconforming Uses. 
    A nonconforming use is a legally existing use which, by the adoption of a previous Ordinance, this Ordinance, an amendment to this Ordinance, or by Annexation, does not conform to the use regulations of the district in which the use is situated (See Section 406). Nonconforming uses shall be regulated as follows: 
A.  The lawful use of land or a building existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance may be continued even though such use does not conform to the provisions herein. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification. The foregoing provisions shall also apply to nonconforming uses in districts as may be hereafter changed. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building has been changed to a more restrictive use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use. 
B.  Where a nonconforming use is allowed in the district by a Special Use Permit in the Permitted Use Table (Section 406), such existing use shall be considered as having a special use permit and shall be considered a conforming use. No special use permit shall be required for reconstruction of the use, however a special use permit shall be required for the expansion of the use (see subsection G below). 
C.  A building which has been structurally damaged more than fifty (50) percent by fire, explosion, act of God or the public enemy may be restored following approval of a Special Use Permit in accordance with Section 315 and the following provisions:

2.  Such use shall, however, meet the regulations of this Ordinance to the maximum practical extent as determined by the Administrative Official, and may be required to meet additional conditions imposed through the special use permit process. 
D.  In the event that the nonconforming use of any building or premises is discontinued or its normal operation stopped for a period of one year, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
E.  A nonconforming use occupying only a portion of a building may be extended throughout the building if the same has been lawfully acquired and actually devoted to such use previous to the adoption of this Ordinance or to any affecting amendment thereof. 
F.  If by amendment to this Ordinance any property has been transferred to a more restricted district by a change in the district boundaries, or the regulations and restrictions in any district are made more restrictive or of a higher classification, the provisions of this Ordinance relating to the nonconforming use of buildings or premises occupied and used upon the effective date of such amendment shall apply. Repairs and alterations may be made to a nonconforming building; provided, that no structural alterations or extensions shall be made except those required by law or ordinance, unless the building is changed to a conforming use. 
G.  A nonconforming use or structure may be made conforming or may be expanded through approval of a special use permit in accordance with Section 315. Such expansion shall meet the regulations of this Ordinance to the maximum practical extent as determined by the Administrative Official, and may be required to meet additional conditions imposed through the special use permit process.

e.  Expend customer parking or outside vehicle storage that does not meet requirements of Section 711 Off-Street Parking and Loading, A through F (legally nonconforming use). 
Such expansion shall meet the regulations of this Ordinance to the maximum practical extent and any additional conditions the Administrative Official deems necessary. 
If fewer than seventy-five (75) percent of the adjacent property owners of record give their consent in writing to the proposed nonconforming use or structure expansion, nonconforming use or structure expansion may only be permitted through the Special Use Permit process.
