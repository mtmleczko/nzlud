PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rockwall, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through May 20, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE UDC:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE INDEX UDCi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Daryl Jaquette, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Kristy Ashberry, Assistant to the City Manager/City Secretary, Julie Couch, City Manager, Kim Whitley, Assistant to the City Secretary for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not to exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each offense relating to fire safety, zoning, or public health and sanitation, including dumping of refuse, nor to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense for all other violations; provided, however, that where the offense is one for which a penalty is fixed by state law, the penalty for such offense shall be the same as that fixed by state law.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Included." When "(App. A)" or "(App. B)" follows the word "Included," the ordinance has been included in the respective appendix, but is not included elsewhere in the Code. Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature and ordinances that amend subject matter not found in the Code are not codified and are considered "Omitted." 
    By adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

Terms of sale will refer to interest rates, identity of purchaser, and applicability of bond insurance. At any reading of a proposed ordinance, the adoption of which was not preceded by a public hearing held by the City Council, interested persons will have a reasonable opportunity to be heard. 
(5)  Every ordinance will become effective upon adoption or at any later time(s) specified in the ordinance, except that every ordinance imposing any penalty, fine or forfeiture will become effective only after having been published once in its entirety or summary form, after adoption, in a newspaper designated as the newspaper of record of the City.

(3)  An emergency ordinance may be introduced at any Council meeting and can be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced. The affirmative vote of at least four members of the City Council will be required for adoption. 
(4)  Emergency ordinances will become effective upon adoption and will be published as soon thereafter as practicable. Every emergency ordinance so adopted, except one authorizing the borrowing of money as described herein, will automatically stand repealed as of the sixty-first day following the day on which it became effective. The ordinance may be re-enacted if the emergency still exists. 
Sec. 3.13. - Authentication, recording, codification, printing and distribution. 
(1)  All ordinances and resolutions adopted by the City Council must be authenticated by seal and signature of the City Secretary and numbered consecutively as adopted. They must be properly indexed and placed in a book kept open for public inspection. 
(2)  The City Council must maintain the codification of ordinances of the City. This codification must be known and cited as "The Rockwall City Code" and must be in full force and effect without the necessity of such Code or any part thereof being published in any newspaper. The caption, descriptive clause and other formal parts of the ordinances of the City may be omitted without affecting the validity of such ordinances when codified. Every general ordinance enacted subsequent to such codification must be enacted as an amendment to the Code. For the purpose of this Section, general ordinances will be deemed to be those ordinances of a permanent or continuing nature which affect the residents of the City at large. Copies of the Code will be furnished to City officers, placed in City offices and made available for purchase by the public at a reasonable price fixed by the City Council. 
(3)  The City Council will cause all ordinances and amendments to this Charter to be printed promptly following their adoption.

The City Council will prescribe the procedure for calling and holding such elections, will define the voting precincts and will provide for the return and canvass of the ballots cast at such elections. 
(c)  If at such elections a majority of the vote will be in favor of creating such a debt of the City, it will be lawful for the City Council to issue bonds as proposed in the ordinance submitting same.

In all cases when the City Council must order an election for the issuance of bonds of the City, it must at the same time submit the question of whether or not a tax must be levied upon the property of the City for the purpose of paying the interest on the bonds and to create a sinking fund for their redemption. (Amended, 1988) 
(d)  State law permits the issuance of Certificates of Obligation at the discretion of the City Council. However, it is the expressed will of the citizens of Rockwall that such obligations be issued only after being authorized by a vote of the citizens at an election called for the purpose of considering the issuance of such obligations. An exception to this guideline is to be permitted only in the event of an urgent public necessity.

Revenue bonds for any purpose other than water and sanitary sewer system improvement, expansion, or reconstruction must be authorized by a majority of citizens voting in an election called for the purpose of considering the issuance of such obligations. Upon approval of such revenue bonds by the voters, an affirmative vote of a majority of the full membership of the City Council will be required to issue said revenue bonds. Such bonds will be a charge upon and payable from the properties, or interest therein pledged, or the income therein gained from, or both. The holders of the revenue bonds will never have the right to demand payment thereof out of monies raised or to be raised by taxation. All such bonds will be issued in conformity with the laws of the State of Texas and will be used only for the purpose for which they were issued.

(2)  Any authorization of payment or incurring of obligation in violation of the provisions of this Charter will be void and any payment so made illegal. Such action will be cause for removal of any officer who knowingly authorized or made such payment or incurred such payment or obligation, and he/she will also be liable to the City for any amount so paid. 
(3)  This prohibition will not be construed to prevent the making or authorizing of payments, or making of contracts for capital improvements to be financed wholly or partly by the issuance of bonds, time warrants, certificates of indebtedness, or certificates of obligation, or to prevent the making of any contract or lease providing for payments beyond the end of the fiscal year, providing that such action is made or approved by City Council. 
(4)  The City Manager will submit to the Council each month or as directed by the City Council a report covering the revenues and expenditures of the City in such form as requested by the City Council.

That regulation of sexually oriented businesses is necessary because in the absence of such regulation, significant criminal activity, including prostitution, illegal drug use, disruptive behavior and high-risk sexual conduct that may result in health hazards, has historically and regularly occurred; 
d.  That sexually oriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and downgrading of property values; these deleterious effects create a legitimate concern of the city to protect property values, business interests and generally protect the city from urban blight associated with sexually oriented businesses; 
e.  That sexually oriented businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to urban blight; 
f.  That sexually oriented videos and films shown in sexually oriented video viewing booths are available for viewing, purchase or rental in other businesses which are less harmful to the health, safety and welfare of the community, and therefore sexually oriented video viewing booths should be prohibited in favor of other venues; 
g.  That the secondary effects precipitated by establishment of a sexually oriented business can be substantially mitigated by requiring separation of the sexually oriented business from residential uses and places of public assembly and from one another; 
h.  That retail-only sexually oriented businesses with no on-premises entertainment have deleterious effects on surrounding commercial, residential and public properties by causing increased crime and adversely affecting property values and the marketability of surrounding properties; 
i.  That, as a consequence of greater visual impacts and impacts on property values, distances separating sexually oriented businesses from residential uses, places of assembly and educational institutions and other land uses should be greater than the normal distances between commercial establishments in the city; and 
j.  That certain sexually oriented businesses involving touching between employees and clients (sexual encounter center, sexually oriented entertainment studio, sexually oriented motels, sexually oriented video viewing arcades, bath houses, body painting studios, and massage parlors) promote prostitution and other criminal behavior and thus the touching between employees and clients of a sexually oriented business should be prohibited; 
(18)  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of H & A Land Corp v. City of Kennedale , 480 F.3d 336, 1 (5th Cir. Tex. 2007), cert. den. 128 S. Ct. 196, 169 L. Ed.2d 36 (U.S. 2007); ILQ Invs. v. City of Rochester , 25 F.3d 1413 (8th Cir. Minn. 1994), cert. den. 513 U.S. 1017, 115 S. Ct. 578, 130 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1994); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., TDA "Kandyland," 529 U.S. 277 (2000), and City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 121 S. Ct. 1223 (2001) and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the city council makes the further legislative findings: 
a.  That sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are generally uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, mechanisms are needed to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises; 
b.  That certain employees of some sexually oriented businesses defined in this article engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments; 
c.  That sexual acts including, but not limited to, masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows; 
d.  That offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions, undesirable incidental effects and increases the possibility of the spread of communicable diseases; 
e.  That persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses; 
f.  That engaging in physical contact at a sexually oriented business is not a form of expression protected by the First Amendment; 
g.  That at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities that occur in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis; gonorrhea; human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS); genital herpes; hepatitis B, non-A, and non-B; amebiasis; salmonella infections; and shigella infections; 
h.  That from 1999 to 2002, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States-25,174 in 1999; 25,522 in 2000; 25,643 in 2001; and 26,464 in 2002, compared to 1982 when only 600 cases were reported; 
i.  That the number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990; 
j.  That the number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with more than one-half million cases being reported in 1990; 
k.  That the surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn; 
l.  That according to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts; 
m.  That sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities; 
n.  That numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films; 
o.  That numerous studies and reports have determined that areas around sexually oriented businesses experience increased criminal activity, including increased property crimes, violent crimes and sex crimes; 
p.  That the findings in subsection (18)a. through o. of this section raise substantial governmental concerns; 
q.  That sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns; 
r.  That a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to apply to the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is operated in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein; 
s.  That removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting and visibility by a manager or third party on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and/or unsanitary sexual activity occurring therein; 
t.  That requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments; 
u.  That the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid with the prevention of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; 
v.  That it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct that this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity; 
w.  That the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article; 
x.  That the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and sex related crimes; and 
y.  That the general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived; 
(19)  The city council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry, preserve the quality of life, preserve property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and to deter the spread of urban blight; and 
(20)  It is not the intent of this article or any previously enacted ordinance to suppress or limit any speech activities protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but to enact a content neutral, reasonable time, place and manner regulation that effectively addresses the harmful secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses.

(e)  For the purpose of subsection (b) of this section, measurement shall be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, between the point on the property line of the property upon which a sexually oriented business is operated (or proposed to be operated) to the point on the property line of the property upon which one or more of the uses listed in subsection (b) of this section exist (or are proposed to exist under any type of permit application) that results in the shortest distance between said property lines.

Sec. 20-79. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (Zones AO/AH and other areas not designated as special flood hazard area). 
(a)  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-27 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of 2.0 feet above the base flood elevation caused by discharges resulting from a fully developed watershed or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least 2.0 feet if no depth number is specified), whichever is greater. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of 2.0 feet above the base flood elevation caused by discharges resulting from a fully developed watershed or the highest adjacent grade at least 2.0 feet higher than the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least 2.0 feet if no depth number is specified), whichever is greater; or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in Zone AO, or below the base flood elevation in Zone AH, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 20-51, are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zone AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(b)  Located within areas not designated as special flood hazard area on the community's FIRM are areas that may be susceptible to potential flood damage resulting from shallow or concentrated flooding. For these areas, adequate drainage shall be provided to prevent flood damages to all new and substantially improved structures. 
(Ord. No. 08-44, § 1(11-54), 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 20-80. - Floodways. 
    Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 20-27 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Procedures for these analyses that are performed to demonstrate compliance with this section shall, at a minimum, be based on those contained in 44 CFR chapter 1, sections 65.5, 65.6, and 65.7. Other analyses, at the discretion of the floodplain administrator, may be required. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulation, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that all of the provisions required by section 65.12 are first completed, and provided that special flood hazard reduction provisions of section 20-81, and the provisions of section 20-50(a)(10) are fulfilled. 
(Ord. No. 08-44, § 1(11-55), 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 20-81. - Special flood hazard reduction provisions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, the following special flood hazard reduction provisions shall apply. A registered engineer must submit a certification with supporting flood study documentation to the floodplain administrator, in accordance with section 20-83, certifying compliance with these provisions. 
(1)  Flood detention/retention. All nonresidential and in some cases residential developments shall provide flood detention/retention, or other flood reduction methods approved by the city to ensure that no increase in peak flood discharges leaving the developed area will occur. 
(2)  Increases in base flood elevations. For all proposed developments, no increases in existing base flood elevations, nor any increases in projected future base flood elevations when assuming a fully developed watershed, shall be allowed on property owned by others, unless the floodplain administrator has been provided sufficient documentation, certified by a registered engineer in accordance with section 20-83, indicating that such increases do not cause any unacceptable and significant adverse impact to property owned by others. 
(3)  Development within the Squabble Creek Watershed. Any proposed development within the Squabble Creek Watershed must include flood reduction methods, such as flood detention, necessary to prevent any increases in flood peak discharges leaving the proposed developed area and to prevent any increases in flood discharges and flood levels along the reach of Squabble Creek between Caruth Lake Dam and Lake Ray Hubbard. 
(4)  Other flood hazard considerations. In addition to compliance with minimum floor elevations and other elevation requirements specified in this article, design and construction of any new development or any substantial improvement shall consider circumstances that may potentially cause greater base flood elevations and discharges (under fully developed watershed conditions) than those normally expected to occur including, but not limited to, the potential for obstructions to flow during stormwater runoff events through hydraulic structures and drainageways, unavailability of flood detention storage provided by floodwater retarding structures due to delayed stormwater dewatering, failure or breach of embankments that provide temporary or permanent impoundment of stormwater, and other malfunctions to hydraulic structures that may prevent them from operating properly or to fail. 
(Ord. No. 08-44, § 1(11-56), 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 20-82. - Review of proposed projects. 
    Permit applications shall be reviewed and approved by the floodplain administrator or his designee prior to authorizing any construction on a proposed project that may potentially cause any increased flooding to any area located within the city's jurisdiction and adjacent communities. Under provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.8, the city or individual acting on behalf for the city may request a review and comment by the Federal Emergency Management Agency regarding whether a proposed project would justify a revision to the Flood Insurance Rate Map. Additionally, the city reserves the right to request a review of a proposed project from any other federal, state, or local government that may have jurisdiction over, or may be impacted by, the proposed project. For purposes of this section, construction includes clearing, grading, filling, placement of any obstruction within the floodplains, and any alterations to existing manmade improvements which are constructed or used for the purposed of reducing flood losses or are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

DIVISION 4. - PROCEDURE FOLLOWING APPROVAL 

Sec. 36-133. - Project implementation and coordination. 
(a)  Once a project is approved, the art review team (ART) commission, in conjunction with the coordinator, shall make recommendations to the city council regarding the details of completion, which could include the following methods of implementation: 
(1)  Open entry competition. Any artist is eligible to enter. The site proposal will be appropriately advertised. Artists may be asked to submit slides of their past work, resumes and letters of intent related to the specific project or specific proposals for the project under review. 
(2)  Limited entry competition. The art review team (ART) commission invites a limited number of artists to participate in the selection process. The artists selected may be asked to submit slides of past work or proposals based on the proposed project. The names of the artists invited to participate shall be publicly announced upon receipt of written acceptance of the invitation. 
(3)  Direct selection of artist. An artist is invited to participate in the project and may be asked to develop a proposal for the project. If desired, a team of several artists may be put together. 
(4)  Direct purchase of existing artwork. A completed work of art is purchased. 
(b)  Upon approval of the art review team (ART) commission's recommendation by the city council, the city shall contract with the artist for services or for the purchase and installation of a specific artwork. In general, art in public places project contracts shall require the artist to produce, deliver, and install a work of art for a guaranteed maximum cost and by a predetermined time. Depending on the nature of the project, performance by the artist may be contractually ensured through phased payment for work completed and/or professional liability coverage. The coordinator shall work with the artist to determine the appropriate budget for each project to ensure that all necessary costs are met. Council approval of the budget for an art in public places project is a prerequisite for the project's final approval. In addition, the artist may be asked to make a public presentation at an appropriate time and in an appropriate forum in the community, possibly where the work is to be sited. 
(c)  In the case of an artist who has contracted with the city to produce a specific work of art, approval of the design prior to the signing of that contract shall be considered sufficient. If, however, the design changes substantially from that which was initially approved, the artist must return to the art review team (ART) commission for subsequent review. Any design changes approved by the art review team (ART) commission must be presented to the city manager or his designee for approval. 
(d)  In the case of a design team approach, it shall be the primary responsibility of the artist and the project consultant to collaborate on the design of the artwork and its relationship with the site. They shall be required to bring the design, in its formative stages, back to the art review team (ART) commission for review. The stage at which final approval of the design occurs will vary from project to project, as specifically stated in the artist's contractual agreement with the city. 
(e)  All project consultants expressing interest in an eligible construction or renovation project shall be advised of the art in public places program requirements and guidelines. The selected consultant and appropriate city representatives shall work closely with the coordinator in the development of the artwork project and with the art review team (ART) commission in selection of the artist/artwork. The project consultant shall incorporate the requirements of the work of art into the construction documents, including time of delivery and installation. 
(f)  On-site activity in connection with installation of artwork shall be handled by the artist, coordinator, and appropriate city representatives within the departments having jurisdiction over the site and/or construction. 
(g)  The coordinator shall function as a liaison between the artist and the various city departments involved in the completion of each artwork project. In instances where construction matters cannot be resolved between the artist and the consultant, the city shall have final authority. 
(h)  The coordinator shall establish and maintain appropriate records of each project, which shall include the contract with the artist, records of the art commission and council's actions, interdepartmental agreements, all billings made in connection with the project and all related correspondence. In addition, the coordinator shall maintain records particular to the project to ensure adequate standards of documentation, registration, care, and installation of the artwork. 
(Ord. No. 06-17, § 1(23-40), 6-5-2006) 
Sec. 36-134. - Maintenance, insurance and repair of public art. 
(a)  The art review team (ART) commission shall make an annual review of the city's art in public places collection for the purposes of a maintenance needs assessment. The art review team (ART) commission shall communicate those needs and the appropriate actions to the coordinator. 
(b)  The works of art acquired through the art in public places program become the property of the city and are held in trust by the city. Therefore, the expenses associated with the routine maintenance and operation of each artwork shall be incurred by the city. Routine maintenance shall be understood to include such things as the periodic cleaning and the operational costs of a work. Any substantive repair of the work, such as structural repair, or major maintenance, shall be considered to be an expense of the related art in public places fund. 
(c)  So far as is practical, in the event repair of the artwork is required, the city shall give the artist the opportunity to do that work for a reasonable fee. Disputes concerning what constitutes a reasonable fee shall be settled by a panel of three visual art professionals with knowledge of curatorial concerns, to be appointed by the art review team (ART) commission. If the artist declines to perform the needed repairs for such a fee, the city may solicit proposals from qualified conservators. 
(Ord. No. 06-17, § 1(23-41), 6-5-2006) 
Sec. 36-135. - Eligible costs for art in public places funds. 
(a)  All art in public places contracts shall require the artist to design, produce, deliver and install a work of art for a guaranteed maximum cost. This cost may include the cost of the work itself and any associated costs which may be required by the city or inherently related to the implementation of the project. Therefore, the following costs are eligible expenditures for the monies included in the total project commission: 
(1)  The work of art itself including, but not limited to: 
a.  The artist's design fee; 
b.  Additional labor, materials and contracted services required for the production and installation of the work; 
c.  Transportation of the work to the site; and 
d.  Installation of the work. 
(2)  Identification plaques and labels. 
(3)  Frames, mats, mountings, anchorages, containments, pedestals, or materials necessary for the installation, location or security of the work of art. 
(4)  Photographs or slides of the completed work for the purposes of routine documentation of the project. 
(5)  Permits or fees necessary for the installation of the work of art. 
(6)  Legal costs incurred by the city, directly related to the project. 
(7)  Associated administrative costs incurred by the city. 
(8)  Other types of expenses specifically provided for in the contract and approved by the council. 
(b)  In addition to the actual costs associated with an art in public places project, the monies are to be used for the selection, acquisition, and substantive maintenance of the work of art commissioned or purchased through the art in public places program. Therefore, the following items are eligible expenditures of the monies: 
(1)  The project specific costs of the art in public places program associated with the selection and acquisition of the artwork. 
(2)  Substantive structural repair and maintenance of the works of art commissioned through the art in public places program. 
(Ord. No. 06-17, § 1(23-42), 6-5-2006) 
Sec. 36-136. - Ineligible costs for art in public places funds. 
    The following are ineligible costs for art in public places funding: 
(1)  Services or utilities needed to routinely operate or maintain the artwork. 
(2)  Modifications in or improvements to building surfaces or structural elements of the building. 
(3)  Directional elements such as signage, except where these elements are integral parts of the original works of art. 
(4)  Art objects which are mass produced of standard design such as playground equipment or fountains. 
(5)  Landscape architecture and landscape gardening except where these elements are designed by the artist and recognized by the art review team (ART) commission as an integral part of the work of art. 
(Ord. No. 06-17, § 1(23-43), 6-5-2006; Ord. No. 16-34, § 2, 5-16-2016) 
Sec. 36-137. - Relocation and removal of art. 
(a)  The following policy has been included to provide a consistent method for determining if a work has remained relevant and/or useful in the context of its original purpose. It also provides a mechanism for the proper removal of a work of art that has deteriorated or has been damaged beyond repair. In this document, the term "removal" means permanent removal of a work of art, and relocation means reinstallation of a work of art at a new site. Works of art may be considered for removal only after five years have passed from the date of the acquisition, unless the installation site has been substantially altered, or the work has deteriorated or been damaged, or the council otherwise determines that circumstances warrant the need for removal or relocation. 
(b)  Requests for removal or relocation shall be acted on through the following process: 
(1)  Requests for removal or relocation may be city or externally initiated (i.e., by a recognized civic group with evidence of community support). These requests must be submitted through the coordinator. 
(2)  The coordinator shall review the request and forward it to the art review team (ART) commission. The art review team (ART) commission will evaluate the request and make a formal recommendation to the council. In evaluating a relocation or removal request, the art review team (ART) commission shall apply the following criteria: 
a.  Visual record of alteration, damage to, or deterioration of the site or work of art; 
b.  Cost estimates for repair, relocation or disposal; and 
c.  A new site plan for relocation. 
(3)  The city council will ultimately determine if an art in public places piece should be relocated. 
(4)  The city council will not generally consider removing an art in public places piece before five years unless there are extenuating circumstances involved.

State Law reference- Jurisdiction. V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 212.003. 
Sec. 38-5. - Policy. 
(a)  Approval of commission required. It shall be unlawful for any owner or agent of any owner of land to lay out, subdivide, plat or replat any land into lots, blocks and streets within the city, or within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city without the approval of the planning and zoning commission and the city council. It shall be unlawful for any such owner or agent to offer for sale or sell property therein or thereby, which has not been laid out, subdivided, platted or replatted with the approval of the planning and zoning commission and the city council. 
(b)  City improvements to be withheld until approval. The city hereby defines its policy to be that the city will withhold all city improvements of whatever nature, including the maintenance of streets and furnishing of sewerage facilities and water service from all additions and subdivisions, the platting of which has not been approved by the planning and zoning commission and city council. 
(c)  Street numbers and building permits to be withheld until approval. No street number and no building permit shall be issued for the erection of any building in the city on any piece of property other than the original or resubdivided lot on a duly approved and recorded subdivision without the written approval of the planning and zoning commission and city council. 
(d)  Adequate public facilities policy. 
(1)  Adequate service for areas proposed for development. Land proposed for development in the city and in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction must be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, including water facilities, wastewater facilities, roadway and pedestrian facilities, drainage facilities and park facilities. Land shall not be approved for platting or development unless and until adequate public facilities necessary to serve the development exist or provision has been made for the facilities, whether the facilities are to be located within the property being developed or offsite. 
a.  It is necessary and desirable to provide for dedication of rights-of-way and easements for capital improvements to support new development at the earliest stage of the development process. 
b.  Requirements for dedication and construction of public infrastructure improvements to serve a proposed new development should be attached as conditions of approval of any development application that contains a specific layout of the development. 
c.  There is an essential nexus between the demand on public facilities systems created by a new development and the requirement to dedicate rights-of-way and easements and to construct capital improvements to offset such impacts. 
d.  The city desires to assure both that development impacts are mitigated through contributions of rights-of-way, easements and construction of capital improvements, and that a development project contribute not more than its proportionate share of such costs. 
(2)  Conformance to plans. Proposed capital improvements serving new development shall conform to and be properly related to the public facilities elements of the city's adopted or approved master plans for public facilities and services, and applicable capital improvements plans, and shall meet the service levels specified in such plans. 
(3)  City options. In order to maintain prescribed levels of public facilities and services for the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens, the city may require the dedication of easements and rights-of-way for or construction of on-site or off-site public infrastructure improvements for water, wastewater, road, drainage or park facilities to serve a proposed development, or require the payment of fees in lieu thereof. If adequate levels of public facilities and services cannot be provided concurrent with the schedule of development proposed, the city may deny the development until the public facilities and services can be provided; require a reduction in the intensity or density of use sufficient to ensure that the facilities systems serving the property have adequate capacity to mitigate the impacts to be generated by the development; or require that the development be phased so that the delivery of facilities and services coincides with the demands for the facilities created by the development. The city may impose any conditions relating the provision of public infrastructure specified by an ordinance establishing or amending the zoning for the property. 
(4)  Property owner's obligation. 
a.  Dedication and construction of improvements. The property owner shall dedicate all rights-of-way and easements for, and shall construct, capital improvements within the rights-of-way or easements for those water, wastewater, road or drainage improvements needed to adequately serve a proposed development consistent with the applicable master facilities plans, whether the facilities are located on, adjacent to or outside the boundaries of the property being platted. 
b.  Facilities impact studies. The city may require that a property owner prepare a comprehensive traffic impact study, drainage study or other public facilities study in order to assist the city in determining whether a proposed development will be supported with adequate levels of public facilities and services concurrent with the demand for the facilities created by the proposed plat. The study shall identify, at a minimum, the adequacy of existing facilities and the nature and extent of any deficiencies, and the capital improvements needed to meet the adopted level of service assuming development at the intensity proposed in the plat application. The study shall be subject to approval by the city engineer. The city also may require, at the time of approval of a subsequent plat application, an update of a public facilities study approved in connection with a prior plat application. 
(5)  Timing of dedication and construction. 
a.  Initial provision for dedication or construction. The city shall require an initial demonstration that a proposed development shall be adequately served by public facilities and services at the time for approval of the first plat application that portrays a specific plan of development including, without limitation, an application for an application for a master plat, or an application for a preliminary or final plat. As a condition of approval of the plat application, the city may require provision for dedication of rights-of-way or easements for, and construction of, capital improvements to serve the proposed development. 
b.  Deferral of obligation. The obligation to dedicate rights-of-way for or to construct one or more capital improvements to serve a new development may be deferred until approval of a subsequent phase of the subdivision, at the sole discretion of the city engineer, upon written request of the property owner, or at the city's own initiative. As a condition of deferring the obligation, the city may require that the developer enter into a facilities agreement pursuant to section 38-22, specifying the time for dedication of rights-of-way for or construction of capital improvements serving the development. 
(6)  Appeals. A requirement or condition imposed upon a plat pursuant to this section is subject to a proportionality appeal pursuant to section 38-14. 
(Code 1982, § 24-5; Ord. No. 78-20, § V, 8-7-1978; Ord. No. 05-41, § 1, 8-23-2005) 
Sec. 38-6. - Application requirements, filing date and time periods. 
(a)  Preapplication conference. The applicant is encouraged to schedule an appointment and meet with the director or his designee to discuss the procedures for approval of a proposed plat and the requirements for a general layout of streets and/or reservations of land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection, and similar matters, as well as the general availability of existing services. A request for a preapplication conference shall be accompanied by a written statement that any proposed development concept discussed at the preapplication conference is not intended as a plan of development or application for plat approval. No applications or plans for development will be presented, reviewed or accepted at the preapplication conference. A preapplication conference is optional and shall not be required as a standard of approval of the development application. 
(b)  Complete application. Every application for plat approval shall be subject to a determination of completeness by the planning director. No application shall be accepted by the director for filing or processing unless such request is accompanied by documents required by and prepared in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The filing or processing by any city official of an application prior to the time the application is determined to be complete hereby is deemed to be null and void and, upon discovery, shall be grounds for denial or revocation of such application. The director from time to time may identify additional requirements for a complete application that are not contained within but are consistent with the application contents and standards set forth in these subdivision regulations. The director also may promulgate a fee for review of the application for completeness. 
(c)  Incompleteness as grounds for denial. The processing of an application by any city official or employee prior to the time the application is determined to be complete shall not be binding on the city as the official acceptance of the application for filing, and the incompleteness of the application shall be grounds for denial or revocation of the application. A determination of completeness shall not constitute a determination of compliance with the substantive requirements of these subdivision regulations. 
(d)  Time for making determination. Following submission of a plan of development or plat application, the director shall make a determination in writing whether the plan or application constitutes a complete application for a master plat, preliminary plat or final plat not later than the tenth business day after the date the application is submitted. The determination shall specify the documents or other information needed to complete the application and shall state the date the application will expire if the documents or other information is not provided. 
(e)  When deemed complete. An application for approval of a master or a preliminary plat that is filed on or after April 27, 2005, or any subsequent preliminary or final plat application filed after approval of such master plat or preliminary plat, shall be deemed complete on the 11th business day after the application has been received, if the applicant has not otherwise been notified that the application is incomplete. 
(f)  Time for completing application. If an application for plat approval is not completed on or before the 45th day after the application is submitted to the director for processing the application in accordance with his written notification, the application will be deemed to have expired and it will be returned to the applicant together with any accompanying documents. Thereafter, a new application for approval of the master plat, preliminary plat or final plat must be submitted. The city may retain any fee paid for reviewing the application for completeness. 
(g)  Official filing date. The time period established by state law or subdivision regulations for processing or deciding an application shall commence on the date that a complete application has been accepted for filing, which date shall be deemed the official filing date. 
(h)  Decision on plat application. 
(1)  General rule. All plat applications shall be decided within 30 days from the official filing date. 
(2)  Waiver. An applicant may request in writing a waiver of the decision time. The waiver request shall contain a statement of the reasons for the waiver and the time for which a waiver is sought. No waiver shall be granted for a period less than the commission's next regularly scheduled meeting. Waiver requests which have not been received by the director on or before the Friday prior to the commission meeting at which action is to be taken on the plat application shall be deemed denied and action shall be taken on the plat application at such meeting as scheduled. 
(i)  Plat application for extraterritorial jurisdiction. Where the land to be platted lies within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city and is subject to an interlocal agreement under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 242, no plat application shall be accepted as complete for filing by the responsible official unless such application is accompanied by verification that a copy has been delivered to the county in which the land subject to the application is located. In the absence of a waiver request, if the city has not received a decision from the county on matters which are to be determined by the county under such interlocal agreement, the application for plat approval shall be denied. 
(j)  Relationship to zoning. For land inside city limits, no plat application shall be determined to be complete where the intended use or intensity of use of the land is not authorized in the zoning district in which the property is located, unless the application is accompanied by a copy of the Unified Development Code or other certification verifying that the proposed use for which the application is submitted is authorized by the zoning district in which the property is located. If a request to change the zoning for the land to be platted to allow the development proposed in the plat is pending, the zoning application shall be decided before a determination is made whether the plat application is complete. If the zoning application is denied, the plat application shall be deemed incomplete. For newly annexed land, no plat application will be accepted for any use or intensity of use not authorized in the "A" Agricultural Zoning District, until the property has been permanently classified on the zoning district map. 
(k)  Vested rights. For purposes of determining a vested rights petition pursuant to section 38-13, no vested rights accrue solely from the filing of an application that has expired pursuant to this section, or from the filing of a complete application that is subsequently denied. 
(Code 1982, § 24-6; Ord. No. 78-20, § VI, 8-7-1978; Ord. No. 02-41, § 1(24-6), 9-3-2002; Ord. No. 04-57, § 1(24-6), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 04-58, § 1(24-6), 10-11-2004; Ord. No. 05-13, § 1(24-6), 3-7-2005) 
Sec. 38-7. - Master plat. 
(a)  Purpose and effect. The purpose of a master plat shall be to delineate the sequence and timing of development within a proposed subdivision, where the tract to be developed will be developed within the corporate boundaries of the city in phases or is part of a larger parcel of land owned by the applicant, in order to determine compliance with the comprehensive plan and the availability and capacity of public improvements needed to serve the development. Approval of a master plat authorizes the applicant to submit an application for approval of a preliminary subdivision plat. 
(b)  Applicability. A master plat shall be required for any division of land within the corporate boundaries of the city where proposed development of the tract is to occur in phases, or for land inside city limits, where the land is located within an existing or proposed PD planned development district. A master plat is neither permitted nor required in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, except that a master plat is required for any development that meets the criteria within this section if the property owner and the city have executed a development agreement pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 212.172. A master plat may not be accepted for filing, if the land subject to the master plat exceeds 250 acres for single-family residential developments, or 100 acres for other types of developments. A phasing schedule for the master plat shall not be for more than five years. The limitations on acreage and phasing schedule do not apply where the proposed acreage or phasing schedule for the master plat is in conformity with an approved planned development district or where a variance has been granted by the city council. If the land subject to the master plat is part of a larger parcel, the remaining land shall be shown as a remainder tract, but shall not be included within the master plat. 
(c)  Remainder tract. A remainder tract is that portion of a larger parcel that is not included within the boundaries of a subdivision plat. Remainder tracts shall not be considered lots or tracts of the subdivision. Approval of a subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of development on a remainder tract. The city may require that information be submitted for a remainder tract with a master plat application solely for the purpose of determining whether the planned public facilities and improvements proposed to serve the master plat will be adequate. Information concerning remainder tracts may be considered in formulating conditions to approval of the master plat application. Based upon such information, the commission may require that additional or less land be included in the subdivision plat in order to satisfy the standards applicable to the plat application. If the master plat is approved, a plat application for a remainder tract shall not be accepted for filing until a final plat has been approved for the first phase of the master plat. 
(d)  Application. An application for a master plat shall be submitted to the planning director, with copies of the master plat drawn at a scale of not more than 400 feet to one inch. If more detailed contour information is not available, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) map contours may be used for concept planning purposes in most cases. The application for the master plat shall include the following information: 
(1)  Names and addressed of the subdividers, record owner, land planner, engineer and/or surveyor. 
(2)  Proposed name of the subdivision. 
(3)  Location in relation to the rest of the city and boundaries of proposed subdivision. 
(4)  A schematic layout of the entire tract to be subdivided, any remainder tracts and its relationship to adjacent property and existing adjoining developments. 
(5)  Proposed major categories of land use showing existing and proposed zoning. 
(6)  Proposed number of dwelling units and population densities. 
(7)  Proposed and existing arterials and collector streets to serve the land to be platted consistent with the thoroughfare plan or proposed amendments. 
(8)  Location of proposed sites for parks, schools and other public uses as consistent with those shown in the comprehensive plan. 
(9)  Significant natural drainage features including drainage courses and wooded areas, as delineated on U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps or on any other topographic maps showing equivalent information. 
(10)  Significant manmade features such as railroads, roads, buildings, utilities or other physical structures as shown on U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps, utility company records and city records when such features affect the plan. 
(11)  Proposed dedication of land or rights-of-way for and construction of public improvements, whether on site or off site, intended to serve each proposed phase of the subdivision. 
(12)  Designation of each phase of development within the subdivision, the order of development, and a schedule for the development of each phase of the master plat. 
(13)  A detailed statement of how the proposed subdivision will be served by water, wastewater, roadway and drainage facilities that have adequate capacity to serve the development. 
(e)  Procedures. 
(1)  Planning and zoning commission action. After review of the master plat application by the director and the city engineer, the application shall be scheduled for consideration by the planning and zoning commission. The commission shall decide whether to approve, approve with conditions or deny the master plat application based on the criteria for approval in subsection (f) of this section. 
(2)  City council action. Following decision by the planning and zoning commission, the city council shall determine whether to approve, approve with conditions or deny the master plat application, taking into consideration the action taken by the commission, and the criteria for approval in subsection (f) of this section. 
(3)  Conditions. The commission or the council may impose such conditions to the approval of the master plat application as are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with the criteria in subsection (f) of this section. Such conditions may address, but are not limited to, matters involving conformity with the city's zoning regulations, the availability and capacity of public improvements, or the phasing of development. In addition to other conditions, approval of the master plat may be conditioned on exclusion of land from the master plat or adjustments in the proposed sequence or timing in the proposed phases of the development. 
(f)  Criteria for approval. The following criteria shall be used to determine whether the application for a master plat shall be approved, approved with conditions, or denied: 
(1)  The master plat is consistent with all existing or proposed zoning requirements for the property, including any development plans for a PD planned development district and standards of any applicable overlay district, and any approved development or annexation agreements. 
(2)  The proposed provision and configuration of roads, water, wastewater, drainage and park facilities generally conforms to the city's master facilities plans for such facilities. 
(3)  The water, wastewater, roadway and drainage systems serving the development have adequate capacity to accommodate the demands for services created by each phase of the development by the time of final plat approval, in accordance with section 38-15 et seq. of these subdivision regulations. 
(4)  The schedule of development is feasible and prudent, and ensures that the proposed development will progress to completion within the time limits proposed. 
(5)  The location, size and sequence of the phases of development proposed assures orderly and efficient development of the land subject to the plat. Each phase of the development shall contain the minimum number of dwelling units or quantity of nonresidential use to assure that such standard is met. 
(6)  Where the proposed development is located in whole or in part in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city and is subject to an interlocal agreement under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 242, the proposed master plat meets any county standards to be applied pursuant to the agreement. 
(g)  Expiration and extension. 
(1)  Time of expiration. Expiration of the master plat shall be governed by the schedule of development approved by the council. The subdivider shall submit and receive approval for a preliminary subdivision plat for the first and all subsequent phases of the master plat within the time limits prescribed in the approved phasing schedule. Failure to meet a platting deadline included in the phasing schedule shall result in the expiration of the master plat for that and all subsequent phases of the subdivision. Expiration of the preliminary plat for any phase of the master plat shall result in the expiration of the master plat for all phases for which a preliminary plat has not been approved and remains in effect. 
(2)  Extension. The expiration date for any phase of the development may be extended by the city council for a period of not more than one year, provided that a request for extension is made in writing by the subdivider at least 30 days before the approved master plat lapses. Extension of the expiration date for the phase extends the expiration date for the master plat for a like period. Every request for extension shall include a statement of the reasons why the expiration date should be extended. The council shall take into account the reasons for the requested extension, the ability of the applicant to comply with any conditions attached to the original approval, whether extension is likely to result in timely completion of the project, and the extent to which newly adopted regulations should be applied to the original application. The council may attach conditions to approval of an extension request such as are needed to assure that the land will be developed in a timely fashion and that the public interest is served, including a requirement that one or more current development standards be applied to subsequent plat applications within the area subject to the master plat. 
(Code 1982, § 24-7; Ord. No. 78-20, § VIA, 8-7-1978; Ord. No. 80-31, § 1, 11-3-1980; Ord. No. 04-57, § 1(24-7), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 04-58, § 1(24-7), 10-11-2004; Ord. No. 06-24, § 1, 6-19-2006) 
Sec. 38-8. - Preliminary plat. 
(a)  Purpose and applicability. A preliminary plat shall be required for all proposed developments or subdivisions of land within the corporate boundaries of the city, except where otherwise provided in this chapter. A preliminary plat is neither required nor permitted in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction except that a preliminary plat is required for any development that meets the criteria within this section if the property owner and the city have executed a development agreement pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 212.172. The required preliminary plat is intended to provide sufficient information to evaluate and review the general design of the development to ensure compliance with the city comprehensive plan, the city Unified Development Code, the thoroughfare plan, and the requirements of this chapter. Where a master plat is required, the preliminary plat shall conform to the approved master plat. 
(b)  Application; required information. An application in writing for tentative approval of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision shall be filed with the planning director at least 14 days prior to the meeting of the planning and zoning commission at which time approval is asked. The preliminary plat shall be submitted on standard 24-inch by 36-inch paper at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet by the subdivider or his agent prior to the sale, offering sale of any lots, tract or building site and prior to completion of final surveys of streets or lots prior to the grading or construction work on any streets and before any map of such subdivision is prepared in form for recording. Where a master plat has been approved, the information contained in the preliminary plat application shall identify the phase of the master plan which the preliminary plat represents and shall be consistent with the information shown on the master plat. The preliminary plat application shall be submitted in accordance with and be accompanied by the following in accordance with the manual of standard design, manual of water distribution, and manual of street and drainage:

Such sketch or map shall show existing subdivisions, streets, property lines and the recorded names of the owners of the adjoining parcels. It shall also show how the streets and alleys of the proposed subdivisions connect or relate to streets and alleys in neighboring subdivisions or undeveloped property and the relationship of the development to existing or proposed major and secondary thoroughfares. 
(2)  Names of owner, etc. The preliminary plat shall show the name of the owner and/or subdivider and the name of the engineer, land planner or surveyor responsible for the preparation of the plat. 
(3)  Identification. The proposed name of the subdivision (which must not be as similar to that of existing subdivisions as to cause confusion) and names of adjacent subdivisions and landowners shall be shown on the plat. 
(4)  Boundary lines, etc. Location of boundary lines and width and location of platted streets and alleys within, or adjacent to, the property; physical features of the property, including location of any existing utilities with the size of sewer and water mains. The outlines of the wooded areas or the location of important individual trees is requited. For all plats, contours must be shown at the intervals of two feet. All elevations shown shall be referred to sealevel datum. The acreage of the property is to be indicated. 
(5)  Location and width of the proposed streets and other features. The location and width of the proposed streets, roads, lots, alleys, easements, widening of existing thoroughfares, and other features, and their location in relation to platted streets, alleys and easements in adjacent subdivisions shall be shown consistent with the thoroughfare plan or other adopted plan for roads and streets. The street layout shall be in conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood areas. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent, or parallel to a railroad right-of-way or a major thoroughfare or freeway or expressway standards, provision shall be made for a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way to provide reasonable use of the intervening land. Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the contour of the land so as to produce useable lots and streets of reasonable gradient. 
(6)  Plat contents. The horizontal scale of the preliminary plat shall be not less than 100 feet to one inch and the plat shall also show: 
a.  The north point, scale and date; 
b.  The boundary line, accurate in scale, of the tract to be submitted; 
c.  The names of all proposed streets; 
d.  The layout, number, and approximate dimension of all proposed lots or building tracts and the square feet of each;

(c)  Conformance to Unified Development Code standard required. All lots or building sites proposed for residential use shall conform to the standards prescribed by the Unified Development Code for the zoning district in which the plat is to be located 
(d)  Tentative approval of council. After the preliminary plat has been reviewed and has received the preliminary approval of the city's engineer and/or planning director, and after such preliminary plat has received the approval of the planning and zoning commission, such preliminary plat shall be submitted to the city council for their tentative approval. The city council may give its tentative approval to such preliminary plat with conditions to be met by the final plat and improvement of the subdivision, or may deny the plat application. The tentative approval of the preliminary plat by the council does not constitute acceptance of the subdivision, but is an authorization to proceed with the preparation of engineering plans and the final plat in accordance with the conditions of such approval. 
(e)  Acceptance of engineering plans. The planning director shall not accept any engineering plans until such preliminary plat has been approved by the city council, unless a statement is signed stating that the applicant is aware that changes may be required on the engineering plans in order to comply with the conditions of approval as required by the planning and zoning commission and city council. 
(f)  Lapse and extension of preliminary plat approval. 
(1)  Expiration of plats. The applicant shall submit a final plat to the city for the entire area for which a preliminary plat has been approved, within one year of the date of approval or conditional approval of the preliminary plat. If the property owner fails to submit a final plat application within such period, the preliminary plat shall lapse, and all further proceedings concerning the subdivision shall terminate. The applicant shall be required to submit a new preliminary plat, as required by this chapter, subject to all zoning and subdivision standards then in effect. 
(2)  Extension and reinstatement procedure. 
a.  Sixty days prior to the lapse of approval for a preliminary plat, the property owner may petition the planning and zoning commission to extend or reinstate the approval. Such petition shall be considered at a public meeting of the commission. 
b.  In determining whether to grant such request, the commission shall take into account the reasons for lapse, the ability of the property owner to comply with any conditions attached to the original approval, the extent to which the property owner agrees to abide by newly adopted subdivision regulations, and any changed conditions in the surrounding area which would make an extension undesirable. The commission shall extend its approval of the plat, or deny the request. In the event the commission denies extension of the preliminary plat, the property owner must submit a new application for approval. 
c.  The commission may specify a shorter time for lapse of the extended plat that is applicable to original approvals, but shall not extend the period that a preliminary plat approval is valid to more than two years from the date of original approval. 
d.  At any time following the lapse of approval of a preliminary plat, a developer may request, and the commission may approve, at its discretion, a reinstatement of such preliminary plat for the purpose of considering and approving a final plat for all or a portion of the area covered by the preliminary plat. The commission shall reinstate a preliminary plat only when it determines that it would be in the public interest to do so to avoid unnecessary review of a new preliminary plat, and when the pattern of development proposed by the plat would not be to the detriment of any nearby area or the general development of the city. The commission may establish such conditions on reinstatement as are necessary to ensure that the reinstated plat conforms to the city's comprehensive plan, including a requirement that the plat conform to the city's current subdivision standards. 
(g)  Criteria for approval. The following criteria shall be used to determine whether the application for a preliminary plat shall be approved, approved with conditions, or denied: 
(1)  Where a master plat has been approved for the land subject to the proposed preliminary plat, the preliminary plat conforms to the general layout of the master plat, the conditions attached to the master plat, and the phasing plan approved therein. 
(2)  The preliminary plat is consistent with all zoning requirements for the property, and any approved development or annexation agreements. 
(3)  The proposed provision and configuration of roads, water, wastewater, drainage easements and rights-of-way and park facilities conforms to the city's master facilities plans for such facilities, including the city's adopted thoroughfare plan, and any amendments thereto. 
(4)  The water, wastewater, roadway and drainage systems serving the development have adequate capacity to accommodate the demands for services created by the development at the time of preliminary plat approval, or that such capacity will be available by the time of final plat approval, in accordance with section 38-15 et seq. of these subdivision regulations. 
(5)  The dedication of land, construction of public improvements or fees to be contributed by the subdivider are adequate to offset the impacts on public improvements created by the development. 
(6)  The design of the subdivision meets all other standards of this chapter. 
(7)  Where the proposed development is located in whole in part in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city and is subject to an interlocal agreement under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 242, the proposed preliminary subdivision plat meets any county standards to be applied pursuant to the agreement. 
(h)  Creation of remainder tracts. Where a master plat is not required, an applicant for preliminary plat approval may propose a subdivision of land that creates a remainder tract, as defined in section 38-7(c). The applicant must submit the information required by the city for a remainder tract with the application for preliminary plat approval. The planning and zoning commission and the city council may approve the proposed subdivision, or require that the remainder tract be included within the preliminary plat. If the city allows the applicant to create the remainder tract, the provisions of section 38-7(c) shall apply.

Such deposit may be used by the owner and/or developer as progress payments as the work progresses in making such improvements by making certified requisitions to the city secretary, supported by evidence of work done; or 
c.  The developer and/or owner files a corporate surety bond with the city secretary in a sum equal to the cost of such improvements for the designated area, guaranteeing the installation thereof within the time stated in the bond, which time shall be fixed by the city council. 
These restrictions with respect to required improvements are made to ensure the installation of such required improvements and to give notice to each owner and to each prospective owner of lots in the subdivision until said required improvements are actually made or provided for on the entire block on the street and/or streets on which the property abuts as described in this chapter and in compliance with the city specifications.

c.  Approved: 
City Engineer Date  
(12)  Final plats shall be accompanied by plan profile sheets, 22 inches by 36 inches and platted to a scale of 100 feet to one inch horizontal and ten feet to one inch vertical, for each proposed street in the subdivision. These plan profiles shall show the existing ground and the proposed grade at five points of cross section: that is at the centerline, the back of curblines, and the property lines. The plan portion shall show the size and locations of all drainage structures, storm drains, curb inlets, etc., and the direction of flow of all stormwater. Plans shall show all public utilities needed to service the subdivision and should accompany the final plat and be approved by the city zoning commission and be in compliance with the city standards. 
(13)  Typical cross sections shall be shown of the type and width of paving proposed for all streets. Curbs and gutters, pavement types and drainage structure design standards of the city, in effect at the time of submission of the plat, shall be used, subject to the approval of the city's engineer and/or city administrator and city council. 
(b)  After approval of the plat, a copy of the original shall be furnished to the city, complete with all necessary signatures. All figures and letters shown must be plain, distinct, and sufficient size to be easily read, and must be sufficient density to make a lasting and permanent record. 
(c)  When more than one sheet is used for a plat, a key map showing the entire subdivision at smaller scale with block numbers and street names shall be shown on one of the sheets or on a separate sheet of the smaller size. 
(d)  The engineer or surveyor responsible for the plat shall place permanent monuments at each corner of the boundary survey of the subdivision and at the centerline intersection point of all streets. These monuments shall be a concrete post, six inches in diameter and two feet long, or other such type of monuments as shall be approved by the city's engineer and/or city administrator. The precise point of intersection is to be indented on the top of the monument. Block corners shall be in reference to these monuments and the bearing and distances of the reference lines filed in written form with the city's engineer and/or city administrator. Tops of monuments shall be set to pavement grade in permanent type pavement, two inches below grade in nonpermanent type pavements and flush with existing ground level in nonpavement areas. Elevations and locations of monuments shall be shown on the final plat. 
(e)  Lapse and extension of final plat approval. 
(1)  Expiration of final plats. The subdivider or property owner shall record the approved final plat within 180 days of the date of approval by the city council. If the approved final plat has not been recorded within such period, approval of the final plat shall lapse, as well as any preliminary plat or master plat for the same land. Thereafter, the subdivider or property owner shall be required to submit a new master plat or preliminary plat application, as required by this chapter, subject to all zoning and subdivision standards then in effect, for the land subject to the expired final plat. 
(2)  Extension and reinstatement procedure. 
a.  Thirty days prior to the lapse of approval for a final plat, the property owner may petition the city council to extend or reinstate the approval. Such petition shall be considered at a public meeting of the council. 
b.  In determining whether to grant such request, the council shall take into account the reasons for lapse, the ability of the property owner to comply with any conditions attached to the original approval, the extent to which the property owner agrees to abide by newly adopted subdivision regulations, and any changed conditions in the surrounding area which would make an extension undesirable. The council shall extend its approval of the plat, or deny the request. 
c.  The council shall not extend the period that a final plat approval is valid to more than one year from the date of its original approval by the council. 
d.  At any time following the lapse of approval of a final plat, a property may request, and the council may approve, at its discretion, a reinstatement of such final plat. The council shall reinstate a final plat only when it determines that it would be in the public interest to do so to avoid unnecessary review of a new plat application, and when the pattern of development proposed by the plat would not be to the detriment of any nearby area or the general development of the city. 
(3)  Dormant final plats. 
a.  A final plat approved after May 11, 2000, and prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, that has not been recorded by the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and to which any other expiration provision does not apply, shall expire the later of two years from the date the plat was approved by the city council or at 5:00 p.m. on September 1, 2005, unless the property owner can demonstrate that: 
1.  Costs for development of the land subject to the final plat including, but not limited to, costs associated with roadway, utility and other infrastructure facilities designed to serve the land in whole or in part, but exclusive of land acquisition costs, were incurred in the aggregate amount of five percent of the most recent appraised market value of the land subject to the final plat; 
2.  Fiscal security was posted after approval of the final plat to ensure performance of an obligation required for all or a part of the land subject to the approved final plat; or 
3.  Utility connection fees or impact fees for all or part of the land subject to the approved final plat were paid. 
b.  Expiration of a final plat pursuant to this section results in automatic termination of any approved master plat or preliminary plat for the same land. 
c.  The city council may grant an extension of the time for expiration of the approved final plat for a period not to exceed one year from the date of approval of the application, provided that a request for extension is made in writing at least 30 days before the final plat expires. Every request for extension shall include a statement of the reasons why the expiration date should be extended. The council may grant a request for an extension taking into account the reasons for the requested extension, the ability of the applicant to comply with any conditions attached to approval of the final plat, whether extension is likely to result in timely completion of the project, and the extent to which any newly adopted regulations should be applied to the proposed subdivision.

(Code 1982, § 24-9.7; Ord. No. 05-41, § 5(24-9.7), 8-23-2005) 
Sec. 38-14. - Proportionality appeal. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Public facilities system means the collection of water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park facilities owned or operated by or in behalf of the city for the purpose of providing services to the public, including existing and new developments. 
    Public infrastructure improvement means a water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park facility that is a part of one or more of the city's public facilities systems development. 
(b)  Purpose, applicability and effect. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of a proportionality appeal is to assure that a requirement to dedicate, construct or pay a fee for a public infrastructure improvement imposed on a proposed plat as a condition of approval does not result in a disproportionate cost burden on the property owner, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed development on the city's public facilities systems. 
(2)  Applicability. An appeal under this section may be filed by a property owner to contest any requirement to dedicate land, to construct improvements or to pay development fees, other than impact fees, for a public infrastructure improvement, which requirement is imposed under the these subdivision regulations to a plat application pursuant to this chapter, whether the requirement is applicable under uniform standards, or is imposed pursuant to an individual evaluation of the proposed subdivision. 
(c)  Proportionality determination by city engineer. Prior to a decision by the planning and zoning commission on a master plat or preliminary plat application, or if no master plat or preliminary plat application is required, on a final plat application, filed under this chapter, the city engineer shall prepare a report affirming that each public infrastructure improvement to be imposed as a condition of plat approval is roughly proportionate to the demand created by the development on the city's public facilities systems, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed. 
(1)  In making his proportionality determination, the city engineer may rely upon categorical findings pertaining to on-site improvements; the proposed or potential use of the land; the timing and sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities; impact fee studies or other studies that measure the demand for services created by the development and the impact on the city's public facilities systems; the function of the public infrastructure improvements in serving the proposed development; the degree to which public infrastructure improvements to serve the subdivision are supplied by other developments; the anticipated participation by the city in the costs of such improvements; any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure improvements for which the proposed development is eligible; or any other information relating to the mitigating effects of the public infrastructure improvements on the impacts created by the development on the city's public facilities systems. 
(2)  Based upon his proportionality determination, the city engineer shall affirm that the public infrastructure improvement requirements of these subdivision regulations do not impose costs on the developer for such improvements that exceed those roughly proportionate to those incurred by the city in providing public facilities to serve the development. 
(3)  The city engineer may promulgate any application requirements that may assist in making the proportionality determination required by this subsection. 
(d)  Commission determination. The city planning and zoning commission shall take into account the city's engineer's report concerning the proportionality of public infrastructure improvement requirements to be applied to a proposed master plat, preliminary plat or final plat application, as the case may be, in making its decision on the plat application, and shall identify any variation to the requirements that are to be included as conditions to plat approval. 
(e)  Appeals. 
(1)  Who may appeal. An appeal to the city council under this section may be filed by a property owner or the applicant for a preliminary or final plat, in which a requirement to dedicate land for, construct or pay a fee, other than an impact fee, for a public infrastructure improvement has been applied or attached as a condition of approval, or as grounds for denying the plat application. 
(2)  Time for filing and request for extension of time. The appeal shall be filed in writing within ten days of the date the planning and zoning commission takes action applying the public infrastructure improvement requirement to the plat application. The appeal shall be filed with the city secretary and shall be forwarded to the city council for consideration in conjunction with its deliberations on the plat application. The applicant may request postponement of consideration of the plat application by the city council pending preparation of the study required by subsection (e)(4) of this section, in which case the applicant shall also waive the statutory period for deciding plats for the time needed to decide the appeal by the city council. 
(3)  Form of appeal. An appeal under this section shall allege that application of the standard or the imposition of conditions relating to the dedication, construction or fee requirement is not roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed development on the city's public facilities systems, or does not reasonably benefit the proposed development. 
(4)  Study required. The appellant shall provide a study in support of the appeal that includes the following information within 30 days of the date of appeal, unless a longer time is requested: 
a.  Total capacity of the city's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park system to be utilized by the proposed development, employing standard measures of capacity and equivalency tables relating the type of development proposed to the quantity of system capacity to be consumed by the development. If the proposed development is to be developed in phases, such information also shall be provided for the entire development proposed, including any phases already developed. 
b.  Total capacity to be supplied to the city's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park facilities system by the dedication of an interest in land, construction of improvements or fee contribution. If the plat application is proposed as a phased development, the information shall include any capacity supplied by prior dedication, construction or fee payments. 
c.  Comparison of the capacity of the city's public facilities system to be consumed by the proposed development with the capacity to be supplied to such system by the proposed dedication of an interest in land, construction of improvements, or fee payment. In making this comparison, the impacts on the city's public facilities system from the entire development shall be considered. 
d.  The amount of any city participation in the costs of oversizing the public infrastructure improvement to be constructed in accordance with the city's requirements. 
e.  Any other information that shows the alleged disproportionality between the impacts created by the proposed development and the dedication, construction or fee requirement imposed by the city. 
(f)  Land in extraterritorial jurisdiction. Where the subdivision or the public infrastructure improvements are located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city and are to be dedicated to a county under an interlocal agreement under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 242, an appeal or study in support of the appeal shall not be accepted as complete for filing by the planning and zoning administrator unless the appeal or study is accompanied by verification that a copy has been delivered to the county in which the facilities are to be located. 
(g)  Processing application. 
(1)  Responsible official. The city engineer is the responsible official for evaluation and processing of an appeal under this section. Where the appeal is for relief from dedication of rights-of-way for or construction of a facility in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction that is to be dedicated to a county under an interlocal agreement under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 242, the city engineer shall coordinate a recommendation with the county responsible for reviewing plats in the county. 
(2)  Evaluation; recommendation. The city engineer shall evaluate the appeal and supporting study and shall make a recommendation to the city council based upon the information contained in the study, any comments received from the county, and the city engineer's analysis based upon the same factors considered in making his original proportionality determination. 
(h)  Decision. The city council shall decide the appeal in conjunction with its decision on the plat application. The council shall base its decision on the criteria listed in subsection (e)(4) of this section, and may take one of the following actions: 
(1)  Deny the appeal, and impose the standard or condition on the plat application in accordance with the city engineer's recommendation or the planning and zoning commission's decision on the plat; 
(2)  Deny the appeal, upon finding that the proposed dedication, construction or fee requirements are inadequate to offset the impacts of the subdivision on the public facilities system for water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park improvements, and either deny the plat application or require that additional public infrastructure improvements be made as a condition of approval of the application; 
(3)  Grant the appeal and waive, in whole or in part, any dedication, construction or fee requirement for public infrastructure improvements to the extent necessary to achieve proportionality; or 
(4)  Grant the appeal, and direct that the city participate in the costs of acquiring land for or constructing the public infrastructure improvement under standard participation policies. 
(i)  Criteria for approval. In deciding an appeal under this section, the city council shall determine whether the application of the standard or condition requiring dedication of an interest in land for, construction of, or payment of a fee for public infrastructure improvements is roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed subdivision on the city's public facilities systems for water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park facilities, and reasonably benefits the development. In making such determination, the council shall consider the evidence submitted by the appellant, the city engineer's report and recommendation, considering in particular the factors identified in subsection (c) of this section, and, where the property is located within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, any recommendations from the county. 
(j)  Action following decision. If the relief requested under the proportionality appeal is granted in whole or in part by the city council, the dedication, construction or fee requirement initially imposed by the planning and zoning commission as a condition of plat approval shall be modified accordingly, and the standards applied or the conditions attached to commission's approval of the plat application shall be conformed to the relief granted. Thereafter, the appellant shall resubmit the plat application to the city council within 90 days of the date relief under the appeal is granted, in whole or in part, showing conformity with the city council's decision on the appeal. 
(k)  Expiration of relief. If an applicant for plat approval prevails on a proportionality appeal, but fails to conform the plat to the relief granted by the city council with the 90-day period provided, the relief granted by the city council on the appeal shall expire. 
(1)  The council may extend the time for filing the revised plat application for good cause shown, but in any event, the expiration date for the relief granted shall not be extended beyond one year from the date relief was granted on the appeal. 
(2)  If the plat application is modified to increase the number of residential units or the intensity of nonresidential uses, the responsible official may require a new study to validate the relief granted by the city council. 
(3)  If the plat application for which relief was granted is denied on other grounds, a new petition for relief shall be required on any subsequent application. 
(Code 1982, § 24-9.8; Ord. No. 05-41, § 6(24-9.8), 8-23-2005)

(Code 1982, § 24-11; Ord. No. 78-20, § X, 8-7-1978; Ord. No. 03-02, § 1(24-11), 2-3-2003) 
Sec. 38-17. - Adequate water for personal use and fire protection required. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city to ensure that all future subdivisions within the city and the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be provided with the water in sufficient volume and pressure for domestic use and fire protection, provided that where the land to be platted lies within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city and the city is not the water supplier, the city council may grant a waiver to the requirement for adequate fire protection if it finds that: 
(1)  The proposed subdivision will meet the land development rules and regulations of the county in which the property is located; 
(2)  The subdivision is to be served solely by on-site sewage disposal systems; and 
(3)  Water lines and other water facilities serving the site are designed and sized to carry future fire flows under the city's criteria and meets all city design and construction standards. 
(b)  The city engineer shall determine through appropriate engineering studies that the city's water system is adequate to provide sufficient water as may be required and reasonably foreseen for domestic use and fire protection for the entire plat. 
(c)  It shall be the policy of the city to withhold issuing building permits until all streets, water, sewer and storm drainage systems have been accepted by the city. 
(d)  The approval of the plat by the city does not constitute any representation, assurance or guarantee that any building within such plat shall be approved, authorized or permit therefore issued, nor shall such approval constitute any representation, assurance or guarantee by the city of the adequacy and availability of water for personal use and fire protection within such plat. 
(Code 1982, § 24-12; Ord. No. 83-54, § 1, 11-7-1983; Ord. No. 04-57, § 1(24-12), 9-20-2004; Ord. No. 04-58, § 1(24-12), 10-11-2004; Ord. No. 05-13, § 1(24-12), 3-7-2005) 
Sec. 38-18. - Right-of-way dedication. 
    In platting the subdivision, the developer shall provide additional rights-of-way required for existing or future streets as shown in the thoroughfare plan or other plan approved by the city council. 
(Code 1982, § 24-15; Ord. No. 84-62, § 1, 12-17-1984) 
Sec. 38-19. - Street improvements and oversizing. 
(a)  When a proposed subdivision of land abuts on both sides of an existing substandard road, or on one side of said road, being substandard according to the then existing current city standard specifications, the developer shall be required to improve the existing road, including sidewalks, to bring the same to city standards, or to replace it with a standard city street at no cost to the city other than as set out in the cost sharing policy of the city in effect at the time of approval of the final plat. If the proposed subdivision is located along only one side of a substandard road, and when in the city council's judgment it is not feasible to reconstruct said substandard road at the time of development of said subdivision, the city council may permit the developer to pay into escrow an amount equal to 115 percent of the developer's share of the cost of said improvements as a condition of the approval of the final plat of the subdivision. If the proposed subdivision is located along a state road, as designated in this section, which is considered substandard, the developer shall be required to escrow funds for the cost of improvements for curb and gutter, sidewalks and storm drainage on nonresidential subdivisions. Developers of residential subdivisions along state roads shall be required to escrow funds for 50 percent of the estimated cost of the required road improvements applicable to that subdivision. State roads shall include SH-205, SH-276, SH-66, FM-549, FM-740, FM-552, FM-3097, FM-1141, FM-3549 and FM-1139. The amount of escrow shall be as determined by the city engineer or his designated representative and shall be payable prior to construction of the subdivision streets and utilities. When funds have been provided and placed in escrow with the city for the development of a substandard road, and the road is reconstructed by a party other than the escrowing developer and at no cost to the city, the escrowed funds and accrued interest, if any, shall be refunded to the developer after completion and acceptance of the improvements. In the event that appropriation of the cost is borne by the city, the difference between the developer's proportionate cost and the escrowed funds, including accrued interest, if any, shall be refunded to the developer after completion and acceptance of the improvements. Where in its judgment the public convenience and welfare will be substantially served and the appropriate use of the neighboring property will not be substantially injured, upon recommendation by the city planning and zoning commission, the city council may, in specific cases, at a regular meeting of the city council, and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, authorize special exceptions to these regulations in order to permit reasonable to these regulations in order to permit reasonable development and improvement of property where the literal enforcement of these regulations would result in an unnecessary hardship. 
(b)  All new roads within proposed subdivisions shall, at a minimum, be built to a width and design which will adequately serve that subdivision. In addition, when required by the city in the interest of the community, the developer may be required to build larger streets to the width shown on the thoroughfare plan. If more than 48-feet (back of curb to back of curb) is constructed, the city will reimburse the developer for the excess width when funds become available, unless the additional width was required by the city engineer or planner to adequately serve the needs of that subdivision. In cases where a street is adjacent to a school or public park, the city engineer or planner may require a 41-foot street (back of curb to back of curb) to facilitate proper traffic circulation. Streets which dead-end at power lines, railroads, or similar rights-of-way, which are intended for future extension across these rights-of-way, shall be constructed in rights-of-way for half the distance across the rights-of-way. Where streets are adjacent to undeveloped land and the property line is normally the centerline of the street, the developer shall provide right-of-way of sufficient width and shall construct paving a minimum width of 24 feet, if deemed necessary by the city engineer or planner. If the city, in the interest of the community, requires the subdivider to construct more than 24 feet, the city will reimburse the cost of the excess width to the developer who installed the paving, at the actual cost of construction, with no reimbursement for additional right-of-way which required to construct the additional paving in excess of 24 feet as funds are available. No reimbursement will be made, however, when the city engineer or planner determines that the excess width is required to serve that subdivision. When, in the city council's judgment, it is not feasible to construct the street and/or railroad crossing at the time of development of the subdivision, escrow for the development of the subdivision, escrow for the developer's portion of the cost may be provided in accordance with this section. In the event the street and/or railroad crossing has been constructed or is being constructed by others, the developer shall pay his pro rata share of the improvements. Escrow or pro rata shall be payable prior to construction of streets and utilities. 
(c)  When reimbursing the developer for oversize development costs, the city shall pay for a maximum engineering fee of six percent of the construction reimbursement. 
(d)  If the improvements of said road or street do not occur within 20 years from the date the money is so placed on deposit with the city, the money, including any earned interest thereon, shall be returned to the property owner of record at that time. 
(e)  Should the city establish an assessment program for street improvements on any road within the city, any funds already placed in escrow for road improvements to said street as required by this section shall be credited toward the property owner of record at the time of assessment. 
(Code 1982, § 24-16; Ord. No. 84-62, § 2, 12-17-1984; Ord. No. 86-45, § 1, 7-28-1986; Ord. No. 16-03, § 1, 1-4-2016) 
Sec. 38-20. - Off-site access roadways. 
(a)  Dependent upon the circumstances of a particular subdivision where access in not deemed adequate by the city council, the council may require the developer to provide and construct off-site access roadways which conform to the street layout standards as provided for in section 38-9. If such access is provided, the developer and the city shall enter into a facilities agreement prior to final plat approval, for the construction of such access roadway. Such agreement shall contain engineering cost estimates, the number of square feet in the proposed roadway, any pro rata schedules plus any other matter deemed appropriate by the parties. 
(b)  For any subsequent subdivision utilizing such facilities, a facilities agreement shall be required between the city and any subsequent developer. Any costs due prior developers as determined by the city's engineer, consistent with the city's policies on thoroughfare improvements, shall be prorated as the use by the new subdivision bears to the amount due. Such prorated amounts will be made a part of any subsequent facilities agreement, collected by the city, and repaid to the original developer making such improvements. All such reimbursements or prorations shall be based on the actual cost of the improvements at the time of their construction. The original developer shall provide the city with the acceptable documentation of actual construction cost from which calculation of reimbursable amounts will be made for inclusion in the facilities agreement. 
(Code 1982, § 24-16.1; Ord. No. 86-62, § 1, 7-21-1986) 
Sec. 38-21. - Sidewalk construction. 
(a)  Sidewalks shall be provided on all streets in areas zoned for one- or two-family residential development and on all streets designated on the adopted master thoroughfare plan. The city may require sidewalks in other locations. All required sidewalks shall be constructed by the builder at the time the lot is developed. 
(b)  If, at the time the property is developed, it is determined to be unfeasible to construct the sidewalks as required, the builder shall pay into escrow the estimated cost of said sidewalk. The amount of escrow shall be as determined by the city engineer or his designated representative, and shall be payable prior to construction of any buildings or other improvements. Where in its judgment, the public convenience and welfare will be substantially served and the appropriate use of the neighboring property will not be substantially injured, upon recommendation by the city planning and zoning commission, the city council may, in specific cases, at a regular meeting of the city council, and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, authorize special exceptions to these regulations in order to permit reasonable development and improvement of property where the literal enforcement of these regulations would result in an unnecessary hardship. 
(Code 1982, § 24-17; Ord. No. 85-21, § 1, 4-1-1985) 
Sec. 38-22. - Facilities agreement. 
(a)  The subdivider shall be required to enter into an agreement with the city which will govern his subdivision if there are pro rata payments, city participation and cost, escrow deposits or other future considerations, variances granted to this section or other nonstandard development regulation. This agreement shall be based upon the requirements of this section and shall provide the city with specific authority to complete the improvements required in the agreement in the event of failure by the developer and to recover the full legal cost of such measures. The city may subordinate the facilities agreement to the prime lender if provided for in said agreement. 
(b)  The facilities agreement shall be a legally binding agreement between the city and the developer specifying the individual and joint responsibilities of both the city and the developer. Unusual circumstances relating to the subdivision shall be considered in the facilities agreement such that the purpose of this section best served for each particular subdivision. Such facilities agreement may stipulate pro rata payments, city participation in unusual facilities, escrow deposits or other payments for future facilities, variances granted to this section and other particular aspects of the development. The developer shall include in such agreement a hold harmless indemnity clause agreeing to hold the city harmless against any claim arising out of this developer's subdivision or any actions taken therein. 
(c)  The developer shall have a continuing responsibility under this facilities agreement after the filing of the final plat and until all facilities and improvements required under this facilities agreement have been completed. When the construction of required improvements has proceeded to the point that certain parts of the subdivision are adequately served, the city manager may release specified portions of the subdivision prior to the completion of all improvements. This shall not be done if the release of such improvements would jeopardize or hinder the continued construction of required improvements, and the facilities agreement shall remain in force for all portions of the subdivision for which a release has not been executed.

Sec. 38-23. - Standards for design of development within subdivisions adopted. 
(a)  Design standards. The city engineer from time to time may promulgate standards for the design of subdivisions and developments within the corporate boundaries and within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. Such standards shall take effect upon their posting by the city engineer. An applicant for plat approval or a property owner may request a review by the planning and zoning commission of any design standard prescribed by the city engineer that is not contained within this chapter or incorporated within an ordinance adopted by the city council at the time of application for plat approval or submittal of construction plans. 
(b)  Enforcement. The enforcement of this code shall be by the city manager, or through any person whom he may designate provided that such person is employed as an employee or under a contract with the city. The city engineer shall have the authority to waive any of the technical provisions as contained in said standards, when literal enforcement of the provisions is determined to be not feasible or reasonable, unless such authority has been expressly reserved by the city council. 
(c)  The October 2016 updated of the Standards for Design and Construction are adopted replacing the Standards of Design, Standard Construction Specifications, dated August 2003, a copy of which is on file for public inspection in the city secretary's office

    Recreational improvements facilities means the park features set forth for a neighborhood park in the activity menu of the park plan. A uniform cost shall be prepared annually for these features and adopted by resolution by the city council. The dedication factor shall be applied to this cost to determine the pro rata share per new dwelling unit for recreational improvements facilities. 
(Code 1982, § 24-42; Ord. No. 87-1, § II, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 03-29, § 1, 9-2-2003; Ord. No. 05-04, § 1, 1-18-2005; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-51. - Purpose. 
(a)  This article is adopted to provide recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks as a function of subdivision development in the city. This article is enacted in accordance with the home rule powers of the city, granted under the state constitution, in statutes of the state including, but not limited to, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 212.001 et seq. It is hereby declared by the city council that recreation areas in the form of neighborhood parks are necessary and in the public welfare, and that the only adequate procedure to provide for same is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property or subdivisions in the city, whether such development consists of new construction on vacant land or rebuilding structures on existing residential property. 
(b)  Neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities, be a minimum of 11 acres, and be within convenient distances for a majority of the residents to be served thereby. Park districts are established by the official park plan for the city and shall be prima facie proof that any park located therein is within such convenient distance from any residence located therein. Primary cost of neighborhood parks shall be borne by the ultimate residential property owners, who, by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the primary beneficiary of such facilities. Therefore, the requirements of this article are adopted to affect the purposes stated. 
(Code 1982, § 24-41; Ord. No. 87-1, § I, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-52. - Impact fee land use assumptions. 
    The total number of residential units which a neighborhood park district is projected to have when fully developed shall be determined by the impact fee land use assumptions as set forth in table 1, park dedication acreage factor per dwelling unit which is on file with the city secretary's office. 
(Code 1982, § 24-42; Ord. No. 87-1, § II, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 03-29, § 1, 9-2-2003; Ord. No. 05-04, § 1, 1-18-2005; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-53. - General requirement for SF-E, SF-1, SF-16, SF-10, SF-8.4, SF-7, ZL-5, 2-F and MF-14, to be used for single-family, zero lot line, duplex, and/or apartment/multifamily residential purposes. 
(a)  Whenever a final plat is filed of record with the county clerk for development of a residential area in accordance with the planning and zoning ordinances of the city, such plat shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of an area of land to the city for park purposes, which area shall be equal to or greater than the property being subdivided's pro rata share of neighborhood park property required for the neighborhood park district in which the property being platted or subdivided is located as shown by the park master plan. Any proposed plat submitted to the city for approval shall show the area proposed to be dedicated under this article. The requirement for dedication under this article may be met by a payment of money in lieu of land when permitted or required by the other provisions of this article. 
(b)  The city council declares the development of an area smaller than one acre for public park purposes to be impractical. Therefore, if less than one acre is calculated to be the pro rata share of a development plat filed for approval, the developer shall be required to pay the applicable cash in lieu of land amount provided for by section 38-55(c), rather than dedicate any land area. No plat showing a dedication of less than one acre shall be approved. 
(c)  In instances where an area of less than six acres but more than one acre is calculated to be the pro rata share of a development, the city council shall have the option of requiring land dedication or cash in lieu of land in accordance with section 38-55(c) after consideration of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation board. If the city determines that sufficient park area is already in the public domain in the area of the proposed development or the neighborhood park district, or if the recreation potential for that zone would be better served by expanding or improving an existing park, dedication may also be refused and cash in lieu of land may, likewise, be required. 
(d)  The dedication required by this article shall be made by filing of the final plat or contemporaneously by separate instrument. If the actual number of completed dwelling units exceeds the figures upon which the original dedication is based, additional dedication shall be required and shall be made by payment in lieu of land amount described by section 38-55(c), or by the conveyance of an entire numbered lot to the city. 
(Code 1982, § 24-43; Ord. No. 87-1, § III, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-54. - Prior dedication; absence of prior dedication. 
    At the discretion of the city council, any former gift of land to the city may be credited on a per acre basis toward the eventual land dedication requirements imposed on the donor of such land. The city council shall consider recommendations of the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation board in exercising its discretion under this section. 
(Code 1982, § 24-44; Ord. No. 87-1, § IV, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-55. - Money in lieu of land. 
(a)  Subject to the veto of the city council and the terms of section 38-53, a landowner responsible for dedication under this article may elect to meet the requirements of section 38-53 in whole or in part by a cash payment in lieu of land, in an amount set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Such payment in lieu of land shall be made at or prior to final plat approval. 
(b)  The city may from time to time decide to purchase land for parks in or near the area of actual or potential development. If the city does purchase park land in a neighborhood park district and said land purchased is used to meet the need for a neighborhood park, subsequent land dedications for that district shall be in cash only and calculated on a pro rata share basis to reimburse the city's actual cost of acquisition and development of such land for parks. The cash amount shall be equal to the sum of: 
(1)  The average price per acre of such land; and 
(2)  The actual cost of adjacent streets and site utilities, or an estimate of such actual costs provided by the city engineer and the recreation improvement costs for facilities as set forth in the park master plan for neighborhood parks. 
Once the city has been reimbursed entirely for all park land within a park zone, this section shall cease to apply and the other sections of this article shall be applicable. 
(c)  To the extent that subsection (b) of this section is not applicable, the dedication requirements shall be met by a cash payment in lieu of land on the basis of a per acre price. Said per acre price shall be determined annually by the city council and shall be based on current land values within the city. Once established the council shall adopt the value by resolution for appreciation as required in this subsection. Cash payments may be used only for acquisition or improvement of neighborhood parks located within the same neighborhood park district as the development in accordance with the park master plan. 
(Code 1982, § 24-45; Ord. No. 87-1, § V, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-56. - Dedication of more than the pro rata share of park land. 
(a)  The developer of a residential subdivision which is subject to the terms of this article may dedicate more land than the pro rata share calculated for the development if approved by the city council. If the developer dedicates an amount equal to or greater than the total required park land area for the neighborhood park district in which his subdivision is located, the city and the developer shall execute a pro rata refunding agreement in accordance with these subdivision regulations which shall recover the cost of land dedicated in excess of the developer's pro rata share after streets, drainage, and utilities are constructed on the dedicated property. 
(b)  The developer shall install the streets, drainage, and utilities to serve the neighborhood park, and the cost of same shall be included in the pro rata refunding agreement. The pro rata refunding agreement shall provide that future developers in the same neighborhood park district shall pay their pro rata share of the actual cost of park development which shall be calculated based on the per acre cash in lieu of land coast in effect at the time of dedication, plus the costs of streets, drainage, utilities, and recreational facilities installed to serve the dedicated neighborhood park. The cost of streets, drainage and utilities installed to serve the park shall be certified by the city engineer. In no case shall the developer receive pro rata payments after he has recovered an amount equal to the number of acres actually dedicated in excess of his pro rata share multiplied by the per acre cash in lieu of land figure in effect at the time of actual dedication, plus the costs of streets, drainage, and utilities as certified by the city engineer necessary to serve the neighborhood park. In no case shall the term of any pro rata agreement provided by this article be for a period in excess of five years from the date of dedication. 
(Code 1982, § 24-46; Ord. No. 87-1, § VI, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-57. - Special fund established; refunds. 
(a)  There is hereby established a special fund for the deposit of all cash funds in lieu of land dedication under this article, which fund shall be known as the "Park Land Dedication Fund." 
(b)  The city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of land dedication under this article referenced to individual plats involved. Any funds paid for such purposes must be expended by the city within eight years from the date received by the city for acquisition and development of a neighborhood park as defined in this article. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first/in first/out basis. If not so expended, the owners of the property on the last day of such period shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of such funds, calculated on a square footage basis. The owners of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such rights shall be barred. 
(Code 1982, § 24-47; Ord. No. 87-1, § VII, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-58. - Additional requirements and provisions. 
(a)  Any land dedicated to the city under this article shall be suitable for park and recreation use. The following characteristics of a proposed area are generally unsuitable: 
(1)  Any area located in the 100-year floodplain; 
(2)  Any area of unusual topography or slope which renders same unusable for organized recreational activities. 
The characteristics of the park land dedication area mentioned in this subsection may be grounds for refusal of a plat. 
(b)  Each park must have ready access to a public street. 
(c)  Unless provided otherwise in this article, action by the city shall be by the city council after consideration of the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation board. Any proposal considered by the planning and zoning commission under this article shall have been reviewed by the parks and recreation board and its recommendation given to the commission. The commission may make a decision contrary to such recommendation only by a vote of at least five members. Should the commission be unable to get this vote, the matter shall then be referred to the city council for final decision. 
(d)  If any provision of this article or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provisions or applications of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this article are declared to be severable. 
(Code 1982, § 24-48; Ord. No. 87-1, § VIII, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-59. - Review and updating park master plan. 
    The city parks and recreation department shall consider the need to update the park master plan at least annually to ensure that the plan remains current and provides an equitable, effective framework from which to pursue the acquisition and development of neighborhood park services for each neighborhood park district. 
(Code 1982, § 24-49; Ord. No. 87-1, § XI, 1-5-1987; Ord. No. 99-20, § 1, 6-7-1999; Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 6-1-2015) 
Sec. 38-60. - Waiver of mandatory neighborhood park land dedication in the case of private developments. 
(a)  If a development is proposed to be a private development where no public streets are dedicated for use by the public, the city shall: 
(1)  Calculate the pro rata share of the proposed private development as if it were to be a development where public streets were to be dedicated. 
(2)  Waive the requirement for mandatory dedication if the private amenities of the proposed development meet or exceed the calculated pro rata share as calculated under subsection (a)(1) of this section. 
(3)  Decrease the total acreage shown in the park master plan as being required to meet the ultimate need for neighborhood parks in the applicable neighborhood park district by the acreage calculated under subsection (1) of this section (for the purpose of future calculations of pro rata shares for future developments). 
(b)  In a private development within a park district or a private development encompassing an entire park district, the park property within the private development must be easily accessible to the general public either through the use of the city trail system or public roadways. If the private development encompasses the entire park district and the ten acres of park land is not continuous, each separate section of park property must be accessible to the general public and connected by way of a minimum eight-foot-wide trail.

Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 38-103. - Definitions. 
    The terms defined in this section shall apply exclusively to the administration of water or wastewater impact fees. For terms not defined in this section, the definitions contained in section 38-227 shall apply: 
    Capital improvement means a water or wastewater facility with a life expectancy of three or more years, to be owned and operated by or on behalf of the city. 
    Credit means a reduction in the amount of a water or wastewater impact fee for a new development, either by a decrease in the number of service units attributable to such development or a decrease in the amount of water or wastewater impact fees otherwise due, that results from contributions of land, improvements or funds to construct system improvements in accordance with this chapter and the Unified Development Code, policies or requirements. 
    Impact fee. 
(1)  The term "impact fee" means a fee for water or wastewater facilities imposed on new development by the city pursuant to this division in order to generate revenue to fund or recoup all or part of the costs of capital improvements or facility expansion necessitated by and attributable to such new development.

    Service area means a water or wastewater service area within the city or within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, within which impact fees for water or wastewater improvements or facility expansions may be collected for new development occurring within such area and within which fees so collected will be expended for those types of improvements or expansions identified in the water or wastewater improvements plan applicable to the service area. 
    Service unit means a living unit equivalent, expressed as a multiple of a one-inch water meter that serves a single-family dwelling. 
    Site-related facility means an improvement or facility which is for the primary use or benefit of a new development and/or which is for the primary purpose of safe and adequate provision of water or wastewater facilities to serve the new development, and which is not included in the water or wastewater improvements plan and for which the developer or property owner is solely responsible under subdivision or other applicable development regulations. 
    System facility means a water or wastewater improvement or facility expansion which is designated in the water or wastewater improvements plan and which is not a site-related facility. The term "system facility" includes a water or wastewater improvement which is located off-site, or within or on the perimeter of the development site. 
    Wastewater facility means a sanitary sewer interceptor or main, lift station, treatment facility or other facility included within and comprising an integral component of the city's collection and transmission system for sanitary sewers.

    Water improvements plan means the adopted plan, as may be amended from time to time, which identifies the water facilities or water expansions and their associated costs which are necessitated by and which are attributable to new development, for a period not to exceed ten years, and which are to be financed in whole or in part through the imposition of water facilities impact fees pursuant to this division. 
    Water meter means a device for measuring the flow of water to a development, whether for domestic or for irrigation purposes. 
(Code 1982, § 24-53; Ord. No. 90-22, § 2, 7-16-1990; Ord. No. 08-26, § 7(exh. 5), 6-2-2008) 
Sec. 38-104. - Title; purpose; authority; applicability. 
(a)  This division shall be known and cited as the Rockwall Water and Wastewater Impact Fee Regulations. 
(b)  This division is intended to ensure the provision of adequate water and wastewater facilities to serve new development in the city by requiring each development to pay a share of the costs of such improvements necessitated by and attributable to such new development. 
(c)  This division is adopted pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 395 and the city Charter. The provisions of this division shall not be construed to limit the power of the city to utilize other methods authorized under state law or pursuant to other city powers to accomplish the purposes set forth in this division, either in substitution or in conjunction with this chapter. Guidelines may be developed by ordinance, resolution, or otherwise to implement and administer this division. 
(d)  The provisions of this division apply to all new, nonexempt development within the corporate boundaries or extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city located within a water or wastewater service area. 
(Code 1982, § 24-52; Ord. No. 90-22, § 2, 7-16-1990; Ord. No. 08-26, § 7(exh. 5), 6-2-2008) 
Sec. 38-105. - Computation of maximum impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  Maximum water or wastewater impact fees per service unit shall be established for each service area. The maximum impact fee per service unit for each service area shall be computed in the following manner: 
(1)  Calculate the total projected costs of water or wastewater improvements necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area identified in the respective water or wastewater improvements plan. 
(2)  From such amount, subtract a credit equal to the amount of that portion of ad valorem tax revenues, if any, to be generated by new service units during the period the water or wastewater improvements plan is in effect, including the payment of debt, associated with the water or wastewater improvements in the plan. 
(3)  Divide the resultant amount by the total number of service units anticipated within the service area, based upon the land use assumptions for that service area. 
(b)  The water or wastewater impact fee per service unit which is to be paid by each new development within a service area shall be that established by ordinance by the city council, as such may be amended from time to time, and shall be an amount less than or equal to the maximum impact fee per service unit. 
(c)  The city may vary the rates of collection or amount of water or wastewater impact fees to be collected within a service district in order to reasonably further goals and policies affecting the adequacy of water or wastewater facilities serving new development, or other regulatory purposes affecting the type, quality, intensity, economic development potential or development timing of land uses within such service district. 
(d)  The maximum impact fee per service unit for water or wastewater facilities, as may be amended from time to time, is hereby declared to be an approximate and appropriate measure of the impacts generated by a new unit of development on the city's water or wastewater system. To the extent that the impact fee charged against a new development, as may be amended from time to time, is less than the maximum impact fee per service unit, such difference hereby is declared to be founded on policies unrelated to measurement of the impacts of the new development on the city's water or wastewater system. The maximum impact fee may be used in evaluating any claim by a property owner that the dedication or construction of a capital improvement imposed as a condition of development approval pursuant to the city's Unified Development Code or these subdivision regulations is disproportionate to the impacts created by the development on the city's water or wastewater system. 
(Code 1982, § 24-54; Ord. No. 90-22, § 2, 7-16-1990; Ord. No. 08-26, § 7(exh. 5), 6-2-2008) 
Sec. 38-106. - Establishment of accounts; use of proceeds and other financing mechanisms. 
(a)  The city's finance department shall establish an account to which interest is allocated for each service area for which a water or wastewater impact fee is imposed pursuant to this division. Each impact fee collected within the service area shall be deposited in such account. Limitations on use of interest attributable to water and wastewater impact fee accounts, disbursement limitations, and recordkeeping for such accounts shall be the same as those for roadway impact fees, as set forth in section 38-234. 
(b)  The use of water and wastewater impact fees and the limitations on the use of such fees shall be the same as those for roadway impact fees, as set forth in section 38-233. 
(c)  The city may finance water and wastewater improvements designated in the water or wastewater improvements or facility expansions designated in the respective capital improvements plan through any authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law, in addition to the use of impact fees. Except as otherwise provided in this division, the assessment and collection of a water or wastewater impact fee shall be additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other tax, fee, charge or assessment which is lawfully imposed on and due against the property. The city council may decide that the city shall pay all or a part of water or wastewater impact fees due for a new development pursuant to duly adopted criteria.

Sec. 38-232. - Computation of maximum impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  Maximum roadway impact fees per service unit shall be established for each service area. The maximum impact fee per service unit for each service area shall be computed in the following manner: 
(1)  Calculate the total projected costs of roadway improvements necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area identified in the roadway improvements plan. 
(2)  From such amount, subtract a credit equal to the amount of that portion of ad valorem tax revenues, if any, to be generated by new service units during the period the roadway improvements plan is in effect, including the payment of debt, associated with the roadway improvements in the plan. 
(3)  Divide the resultant amount by the total number of service units anticipated within the service area, based upon the land use assumptions for that service area. 
(b)  The impact fee per service unit which is to be paid by each new development within a service area shall be that established by ordinance by the city council, as such may be amended from time to time, and shall be an amount less than or equal to the maximum impact fee per service unit established in subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  The city may vary the rates of collection or amount of roadway impact fees per service unit among or within service districts in order to reasonably further goals and policies affecting the adequacy of roadway facilities serving new development, or other regulatory purposes affecting the type, quality, intensity, economic development potential or development timing of land uses within such service districts. 
(d)  The maximum impact fee per service unit for roadway facilities, as may be amended from time to time, is hereby declared to be an approximate and appropriate measure of the impacts generated by a new unit of development on the city's roadway system. To the extent that the impact fee charged against a new development, as may be amended from time to time, is less than the maximum impact fee per service unit, such difference hereby is declared to be founded on policies unrelated to measurement of the impacts of the new development on the city's roadway system. The maximum impact fee may be used in evaluating any claim by a property owner that the dedication or construction of a capital improvement imposed as a condition of development approval pursuant to the city's subdivision or development regulations is disproportionate to the impacts created by the development on the city's roadway system.

(b)  Master planned projects, including subdivisions containing multiple phases, and whether approved before or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this subdivision is derived may apply for credits against roadway impact fees for the entire project based upon contributions of land, improvements or funds toward construction of system facilities, or other roadway improvements supplying excess capacity. Credits shall be determined by comparing vehicle miles of capacity supplied by the project with vehicle miles of capacity to be consumed by development within the project, utilizing a methodology approved by the city. The credit determination shall be incorporated within an agreement for credits, in accordance with section 38-280. 
(c)  All credits against roadway impact fees shall be based upon standards promulgated by the city, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines, including the following standards: 
(1)  No credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  The unit costs used to calculate offsets and credits may be those assumed for the transportation improvements included in the transportation improvements plan, or other costs used by the city in the ordinary course of administering its capital facilities agreements for roadways. 
(3)  No credit shall be given for a roadway facility which is not identified within the roadway improvements plan, unless the facility is on the master thoroughfare plan and the city agrees that such improvement supplies capacity to new developments other than the development paying the roadway impact fee and provisions for credits are incorporated in an agreement for credits pursuant to section 38-280. 
(4)  In no event will the city grant a credit when no roadway impact fees can be collected pursuant to this division or for any amount exceeding the total roadway impact fees due for the development, unless expressly agreed to by the city in writing. 
(5)  Credits for system facilities dedicated to and accepted by the city for a development prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived shall be prorated among the total number of service units within such development, including existing service units, and shall be further reduced by the amount of any participation funds received from the city. 
(6)  The city may participate in the costs of a system improvement to be dedicated to the city, including costs that exceed the amount of the impact fees due for the development, in accordance with policies and rules established by the city. The amount of any credit for construction of a system facility shall be reduced by the amount of any participation funds received from the city.

Sec. 38-360. - Land use assumptions report. 
(a)  Foreword. Impact fees are charges imposed against new development to generate revenue for or recoup the cost of capital facilities (or infrastructure) necessitated by and attributed to new development. These fees are generally implemented to reduce the economic burden of a municipality when addressing the need for adequate capital improvements to accommodate growth. 
(b)  Purpose. Chapter 395, Financing Capital Improvements Required by New Development in Municipalities, Counties, and Certain Other Local Governments, of the Texas Local Government Code outlines the process for adopting and updating impact fees for political subdivisions. On April 21, 2008 the City of Rockwall adopted roadway and water/wastewater impact fees per Ordinance No. 08-21. According to the statutory requirements stipulated by the Texas Local Government Code impact fees are required to be updated a minimum of every five years (Texas Local Government Code § 395.052). 
In approaching an update to existing impact fees it is important for a city to assess its growth and employment potential and establish land use assumptions that will guide development for a ten-year planning period (i.e. 2013-2023) (Texas Local Government Code § 395.001(5)). These land use assumptions form the basis for the preparation of the impact fee capital improvement plan for water, wastewater and roadway facilities. 
In order to determine the need and timing of capital improvements to serve future development, a rational estimate of future growth is required. The purpose of this report is to formulate growth and employment projections based upon assumptions pertaining to the type, location, quantity and timing of future development within the city, and to establish and document the methodology used for preparing these land use assumptions. 
(1)  Elements of the land use assumptions report. This report contains the following components: 
a.  Methodology: This component of the report contains the systematic and theoretical analysis of the methods and principals used to prepare the projections and land use assumptions contain within this report. 
b.  Service areas and data collection zones: This component provides an explanation of the data collection zones (i.e. traffic survey zones (TSZ)) and the roadway, water and wastewater impact fee service areas for capital facilities. 
c.  Base year data: This component provides information on population, housing and employment in the city as of 2013 for each capital facility service area. 
d.  Ten-year growth assumptions: This component provides assumptions with respect to the population, housing and employment for the city in ten years (i.e. 2023). This information is broken out by capital facility service area. 
e.  Build out assumptions: This component provides projections for population, housing and employment under the assumption that the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) are completely developed, or "built out." 
f.  Summary: This component provides a synopsis of the land use assumptions contained within this report. 
g.  Appendix: This component contains information that was important in deriving the population, housing and employment projections for 2013-2023. 
(c)  Methodology. 
(1)  Factors. Based upon the growth assumptions and the capital improvements needed to support growth, it is possible to develop an impact fee structure which fairly allocates improvement costs to growth areas in relationship to their impact upon the entire infrastructure system. The data in this report has been formulated using reasonable and generally accepted planning principles. 
These land use assumptions and future growth projections take into consideration several factors influencing development patterns. These factors include: 
a.  The character, type, density and quantity of existing development. 
b.  The current zoning patterns and anticipated future land uses as established in the comprehensive plan (i.e. the city's future land use plan map). 
c.  The availability of land to support future expansion of development. 
d.  The current and historical growth trends of both population and employment within the city. 
e.  The location and configuration of vacant parcels of land and their ability to support development. 
f.  The growth of employment utilizing previously established and generally accepted data (i.e. North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) 2010 and 2015 employment projections). 
g.  Local knowledge concerning future development projects or anticipated development within the city. 
(2)  Land use assumptions report elements. The following is the general methodology that was used for the preparation of this report: 
a.  Population, housing and employment data was collected from the United States Census Bureau, North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), the city geographical information systems (GIS) department, the city building inspection department and other acceptable sources. This information was then analyzed and used to provide base information for all service areas from which projections could be extrapolated (see subsection (d)). 
b.  The base year (i.e. 2013) estimates for housing, population and employment were calculated based on the information collected (see subsection (e)). 
c.  From the base year and the information gathered from various sources a growth rate was established by examining recent building permit information, past growth trends and anticipated development over the next ten years. This growth rate was then applied to each of the impact fee service areas to project the base year data over the ten-year planning period (i.e. 2013-2023) (see subsection (f)). 
d.  After the projections for housing, population and employment were prepared for the ten-year planning period city staff made adjustments to account for known or anticipated development activity within the planning periods. In making these adjustments city staff took into consideration the recommendations made within the 2012 Rockwall Comprehensive Plan update, existing public works data, economic information provided by the Rockwall Economic Development Corporation (REDC) and demographic information provided by the GIS and building inspections departments. 
e.  Finally, the city's build out projections for housing, population and employment were calculated by establishing the city's carrying capacity in terms of developable acres and projecting population forward using the previously established compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to establish a build out year. The housing and employment information were then projected to the build out year (see subsection (g)). 
(d)  Data collection zones and service areas. 
(1)  Data collection zones. The data collection zones used for this study were the North Central Texas Council of Government's (NCTOG's) traffic survey zones (TSZs). A TSZ is a small geographic area developed by the NCTOG to serve as the basis for the regional TransCAD travel demand model and for the purpose of performing various other regional planning activities. TSZs were originally formulated on the basis of homogeneity and traffic generation potential using major arterials, creeks, railroad lines and other physical boundaries for delineation. It should be noted that several TSZs were adjusted in the calculations because portions include areas outside of the city limits. 
FIGURE 1: TRAFFIC SURVEY ZONES (TSZs) 
Note: The TSZs below have been clipped to the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) 

(2)  Service areas. The Texas Local Government Code (TLGC) requires that service areas be established within the corporate boundaries of a political subdivision for the purpose of ensuring that the capital improvements service the areas generating need. The boundaries for impact fees are defined as follows: 
Roadway impact fees refers to a service area that is limited to the corporate boundaries of a political subdivision or city, and cannot extend into the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) or for a distance exceeding more than six miles. The city is divided into four service areas that are depicted in figure 3 of this section. 
Water and wastewater impact fees refers to a service area that includes a city's corporate boundaries and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). This service area is depicted in figure 4 of this section.

(5)  Summary of data. The current database and the database prepared in 2007, along with all future projections, were drafted utilizing the following geographic areas: 
a.  Service area. The service area correlates to the water, wastewater and roadway service areas identified in figures 3 and 4. As previously stated the corporate boundaries of the city serve as the limits for the roadway service areas and the water and waste water service areas include the corporate boundaries and the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). 
b.  Traffic survey zone (TSZ). A traffic survey zone or TSZ are geographic areas established by the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), which are used for data collection purposes. 
Additionally, all databases and projections utilized the following variables: 
a.  Households (2013). Household data includes living units (i.e. single-family, duplex, multi-family, group home/quarters, etc.) existing at the end of the calendar year 2012 (January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012). This number was derived using 2010 United States Census data relating to households, residential building permits obtained from the building inspections department, and address point data obtained from the geographic information systems department (GIS). 
b.  Households (2023). This is the projected household data by service area for the year 2023, which represents a ten-year growth projection. This information was derived by staff using proper projection techniques. 
c.  Population (2013). This is the existing population for the base year (i.e. 2013). This information was calculated utilizing the number of households existing at the end of the calendar year 2012, the occupancy rate and average household size as established by the United State Census Bureau, and the population of all group quarters (i.e. (# of Households-Vacancy Rate) × Household Size + Group Quarters Population = Population). 
d.  Population (2023). The projected population by service area for the year 2023, which represents a ten-year growth projection. This information was derived by staff using proper projection techniques. 
e.  Employment (2013). Employment data was aggregated to three employment sectors, which include "basic," "retail" and "service" as provided by the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG). These service sectors serve as the basis for nonresidential trip generation. The following is a summary of these employment sectors followed by corresponding North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code: 
1.  Basic. Land use activities that produce goods and services such as those that are exported outside the local economy. These include manufacturing, construction, transportation, wholesale trade, warehousing and other industrial uses (NAICS Code: #210000-#422999). 
2.  Retail. Land use activities which provide for the retail sale of goods that primarily serve households and whose location choice is oriented toward the household sector. These include uses such as grocery stores, restaurants, etc. (NAICS Code: #440000-#454390). 
3.  Service. Land use activities which provide personal and professional services. These include such uses as financial, insurance, government, and other professional and administrative offices (NAICS Code #520000-#928199). 
f.  Employment (2023). The projected employment data was aggregated to three employment sectors, which include "basic," "retail" and "service" as provided by the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG). These service sectors were then projected by service area to the year 2023, which represents a ten-year growth projection. This information was derived by staff using proper projection techniques. 
(e)  Base year data. This section documents the methods used to derive the base year data for the city as of January 1, 2013. This benchmark information provides a starting point in which to extrapolate the ten-year growth assumptions that are presented in the following section (see subsection (f)). 
(1)  Population growth. 

One method of predicting future growth is to examine past growth trends. The city and county have experienced robust growth over the past decade (see figure 5). Past growth trends from the United States Census Bureau and the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) were examined in conjunction with building permit data provided from the city building inspections department (this information is summarized in figure 6). The following formula lays out the methodology used to calculate the 2013 population estimate: 
POP = (NH × OR) × AHS + GQP 
[POP = (14,831 × 0.947) × 2.81 + 325, or POP = 39,817] 
WHERE, 
POP = 2013 Population 
NH = Number of Households (14,831 per City of Rockwall) 
OR = Occupancy Rate (94.7% per US Census Bureau) 
AHS = Average Household Size (2.81185 per US Census Bureau) 
GQP = Group Quarter Population (325 per City of Rockwall) 
This population (i.e. 39,817 ) will serve as the base population for this report.

(2)  Population growth rate. A compound annual growth rate (CAGR) allows for a general assessment of growth when considering periodic increases and decreases in residential population growths that coincide with changing economic conditions. Various sources were used in establishing the past growth rates. These sources indicate rates of growth change between 3.25 percent and 4.75 percent (see Table 1). Based upon this data, an analysis of the ten-year forecast, and city staff's judgment, a four percent CAGR was determined to be a sufficient assumption for the ten-year projection period. The calculated population numbers for all service areas for the years 2013 and 2023 are depicted in Appendix A and B of this section. 

(3)  Additional growth indicators. The annual population growth rate has slowed in the city from 10.8 percent (2000-2005) to 4.6 percent (2005-2010), and finally decreasing to 2.0 percent in 2010 (see table 1). The increase/decrease of residential building permits coincides with the fluctuations in growth rates (see figure 7). Recent permit data shows an increase in single-family activity. In fact, in 2013 single-family permits (issued from January 1, 2013 to February 28, 2013) were up 70 percent from the same period in 2012. This recent increase in single-family building permits combined with the Texas Water Board's ten-year and 20-year county population projections, coupled with an overall sense of market recovery has led the city's staff to comfortably assume that the overall growth for the next ten-year period will average four percent. However, it is likely that annual growth will gradually increase from its current two percent rate to a five percent rate near the end of the forecasted period.

*2013: January 1, 2013-March 21, 2013 


(4)  Existing land use. In any evaluation and projection of future land use patterns, a documentation of existing conditions is necessary. An analysis of existing land use patterns was prepared based on a zoning classification inventory of the city (see table 2). This also serves to document the present physical condition of the city with regard to any infrastructure deficiencies that may exist. The city's comprehensive plan will serve as an additional basis for future growth projections. Nearly 25 percent of the city's land area is devoted to planned development districts, which are difficult to define in terms of land use since most of them contain allowances for a mixture of land uses. In addition to current zoning classifications table 2 also contains estimates of the land use categories permitted within the city's planned development districts. 
FIGURE 8: EXISTING LAND USE MAP (ZONING MAP) 

(5)  Existing employment. The base employment data (i.e. 2013) was calculated by traffic survey zone (TSZ) from employment estimates provided by the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG). As TSZs do not conform to the corporate boundaries of a city, staff made allocations based on the locations of existing land uses and the percentage of the TSZ located within the city limits/extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). Additionally, staff reviewed the 2010 and 2015 NCTCOG employment estimates and applied manual adjustments based on local knowledge of the city and proposed/current development. From this employment data staff determined the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and applied it using the linear extrapolation method to the 2010 employment data. This resulted in the 2013 employment data depicted in Appendix C and D of this report. 
(f)  Ten-year growth assumptions. 

(1)  Generally. In this study growth is characterized by two forms: 1) Population (i.e. residential land use), and 2) Employment (i.e. nonresidential land use). To calculate a reasonable growth rate for population and employment it was necessary for staff to make a series of assumptions on which to base the ten-year growth projections. These assumptions are summarized as follows: 
a.  Future growth identified within this study will conform to the future land use plan depicted in the comprehensive plan. 
b.  The city will be able to finance the necessary improvements to accommodate future growth. 
c.  School facilities will sufficiently accommodate any identified increases in the population. 
d.  Densities will conform to the land classifications identified within the comprehensive plan and as depicted on the future land use plan. 
The ten-year projections are based on the growth rate which was previously discussed and staff's consideration of past development trends. Tables 3 and 4 detail the ten-year projections for households, population and employment for the service areas associated with roadway and water/wastewater impact fees. 

(2)  Population 2023. The city has experienced significant growth since 2000 when the estimated population was 18,000 residents. Today the population is over double the 2000 population at an estimated 39,817. This growth trend is not just evident in the city as the greater Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area has become one of the fastest growing regions in the United States both in terms of population and employment. Although local growth has slowed since 2006 all data appears to indicate that this is only a temporary condition as the area's economy continues to recover from the national housing slump that began in 2008. Using the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) method staff projects that the population for the city will be 58,939 residents by 2023 (see figure 9). 
FIGURE 9: TEN-YEAR POPULATION GROWTH AT A FOUR PERCENT COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE 

In determining this population projection staff utilized residential building permit counts coupled with an assumption that the average people per household was 2.81 (2010 US Census). This figure was used to account for a mixture of multi-family and single-family households. Additionally, between 2000 and 2012 the city issued an average of 623 building permits per year; with the highest number of permits topping out at 1,033 in 2005, and the lowest number of building permits issued in 2008 at 150 (see table 5). From this information staff estimated that the city will issue an average of 651 residential building permits per year over the next ten-year period (see table 5 and figure 10). This estimate takes into consideration the type of development likely (i.e. single-family or multi-family) to occur in a given area.

Map Key: Orange = New building permits; Green = New residents 

(3)  Employment 2023. Employment data for the year 2023 was based upon data provided by the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG). NCTCOG has provided employment data by Traffic Survey Zone (TSZ) for 2015 and 2035. After staff's adjustments for TSZ coverage area and anticipated future development were accounted for, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was derived between the 2015 and 2035 staff-adjusted NCTCOG employment numbers. Linear extrapolation of the CAGR produced the 2023 employment estimates by TSZ as listed in the appendices of this document (see Appendix C and D). 
Staff's assumptions of future growth are confirmed by 2030 data derived from the North Texas 2050 study published by Vision North Texas. The majority of the city is forecasted to have an employment density of greater than 1.7 units per acre, and upwards of 3.5+ units per acre in areas adjacent Interstate Highway 30 (IH-30) and within Rockwall's Industrial Park (located adjacent to State Highway 276 (SH-276)). 
(g)  Build out projections. A build out projection for a city (also referred to as the city's carrying capacity) is an estimate of the location and density of all potential development, employment and population that a city can support within its future corporate boundaries. 

(1)  Establishing the city's population at build out. In establishing the city's population at build out staff made the following assumptions: 
a.  All vacant land within the city's corporate boundaries will develop with the maximum density permitted for the current zoning per the Unified Development Code. 
b.  All agricultural (Ag) district property is assumed to be vacant and will develop at 2.0 units per acre. 
c.  All property within the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) is assumed to be vacant and will be developed in conformance with the future land use map at the maximum density permitted by the comprehensive plan. 
d.  The city's ETJ is fixed and will not increase in the future. 
Taking these assumptions into consideration, staff utilized geographical information systems (GIS) software to calculate all the undeveloped land within the city's corporate boundaries, including the ETJ (see table 6). Once calculated the acreages were broken down by land use and multiplied by the maximum density permitted for each of the land uses as established within the Unified Development Code and the comprehensive plan. These totals were then multiplied by the average people per household (i.e. 2.81) (2010 US Census) to establish the population at build out (i.e. 139,919). From this point staff projected the population forward using the previously established four percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (see subsection (f)) until the build out population was reached (see table 7). This established a build out year of 2046. The following formula lays out the methodology used to calculate the numbers: 
BO = POP + VPOP + EPOP 
[BO = 39,817 + 48,663 + 51,439, or BO = 136,657] 
VPOP = S [(LU 1 × D 1 ) ... (LU x × D x )] × AHS or VPOP = 48,663 
EPOP = (LDR × 2.0) + (MDR × 3.0) + (HDR × 5), (i.e. EPOP = 50,123 + 1,316 + 0) or EPOP = 51,439 
WHERE, 
BO = Build Out Population 
POP = 2013 Population (i.e. Current Population) 
VPOP = Population of Vacant Land within the City Limits 
EPOP = Population of Vacant Land within ETJ 
LU = Vacant Available Land (inside the City Limits) for a Given Land Use 
D = Maximum Density Permitted for a Given Land Use (Unified Development Code) 
AHS = Average Household Size (2.81185 per US Census Bureau) 
LDR = Low Density Residential Acreage Available in the ETJ 
MDR = Medium Density Residential Acreage Available in the ETJ 
HDR = High Density Residential Acreage Available in the ETJ 
(h)  Summary. The following is a summary of staff's findings when preparing the land use assumption report in preparation for updating the roadway, water and wastewater impact fees for 2013: 
(1)  The average annual growth rate as calculated by staff is four percent. This growth rate was established based on data from the US Census, Texas Water Commission, North Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), the city and county. Using this growth rate staff projected the following population numbers: 
a.  The population of the city as of 2013 is 39,817. This is expected to increase by ~32 percent in the next ten years to an estimated 58,940 by 2023. 
b.  The population for the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) as of 2013 is 44,066. This is expected to increase by ~32 percent in the next ten years to an estimated 65,073 by 2023. 
(2)  The estimated employment for the city as of 2013 is 16,023 jobs, with another 1,991 jobs existing within its ETJ. Staff estimates this number to climb to 23,182 jobs within the city limits, and another 2,377 jobs within the ETJ by 2023. 
(3)  Staff has established that there are currently 8,610.53 undeveloped acres of land within the city limits. This represents ~45 percent of the current land in the city (see table 8). Additionally, the city has access to another 10,521.60 acres of land within its current ETJ (see table 9). At the bottom of this page is a summary of all vacant land by current land use existing within the city's corporate boundaries and its ETJ (see tables 8 and 9). 
(4)  According to staff estimates the city is expected to be built out in the year 2046, with a total population of 139,919.

ARTICLE IV. - DISASTER WARNING SIREN 

Sec. 38-399. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Commission means the planning and zoning commission of the city. 
    Council means the city council. 
    Subdivider or developer means an individual, firm, association, syndicate, co-partnership, corporation, or other organization dividing or proposing to divide land, developing or making improvements to such land, so as to effect a subdivision of land hereunder for himself, or for itself, or for another. 
    Subdivision means the division of any lot, tract, or parcel of land into two or more lots or sites for the purpose of sale or of building development, whether immediate or future. The term "subdivision" includes resubdivision or replatting of an existing subdivision, building upon, or other development of land. When appropriate to context, the term "subdivision" shall relate to the process of subdividing or to the land subdivided. Subdivisions of mobile home spaces for sale, lease or rent shall comply with all provisions of the city Code regulating mobile home parks, as it now exists or it may hereafter be amended. 
(Code 1982, § 24-72; Ord. No. 98-11, § 2, 4-6-1998) 
Sec. 38-400. - Purpose. 
    This article is adopted to ensure that adequate early warning sirens are provided to meet the additional need created by new development. 
(Code 1982, § 24-70; Ord. No. 98-11, § 2, 4-6-1998) 
Sec. 38-401. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to all new development within the city and all subdivisions within its extraterritorial jurisdiction after the effective date of ordinance from which the article was derived: 
(1)  For which a final plat is required to be submitted to the city for approval in accordance with state law and the ordinances of the city; or 
(2)  Existing vacant platted lots for which a building permit has not yet been issued by the city. 
(Code 1982, § 24-71; Ord. No. 98-11, § 2, 4-6-1998) 
Sec. 38-402. - General requirements. 
(a)  Fee established; calculation. The city council hereby establishes a disaster warning siren fee which shall be calculated as follows: 
Fee = Number of Acres Platted × Cost per Acre*  
    *The cost per acre will be based upon the cost of the last bid siren. 
    The number of acres served is determined by the radius (feet) served by the siren squared, times 3.1416, divided by 43560. 
    Example: If a siren serves a 5,000-foot radius the formula would be: 
5,000 2 × 3.1416 ÷ 43,560 = 1,803 acres  
    If the cost of the last bid siren was $23,150.00, the fee would be $12.84 per acre ($23,150.00 ÷ 1,803 = $12.84.) 
(b)  Payment required. The city council hereby establishes that the owner of any property which is to be developed, and to which this article applies, shall pay to the city at the time of subdivision platting or upon issuance of a building permit for existing platted lots at the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived a disaster warning siren fee to provide for the early warning siren needs created by such development, in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Time of payment. Payment of the disaster warning siren fee required herein shall be paid as a condition of approval of any final plat or replat. Payment shall be made prior to the filing of the plat unless otherwise stated in a facilities agreement approved by the council. In the case of existing platted lots, the fee shall be paid at the time of issuance of the building permits. 
(d)  Early warning siren fund. All cash payments paid to the city in accordance with this article shall be deposited in a separate early warning siren fund. The city shall account for all such payments with reference to each development for which the payment is made. 
(e)  Use of funds. Any payments made to the early warning siren fund shall be used solely for the acquisition, development, expansion or upgrading of early warning sirens. 
(f)  Right to refund. If all or part of the payments made pursuant to this article are not expended, or not under contract to be expended for the purposes authorized in this article, within ten years of the date that 95 percent of all certificates of occupancy have been issued for the completed development of the property for which the payments were made, the person or entity who made such payment shall be entitled to a refund of all unexpended funds if a written request for such refund is made within one year of entitlement. If no such timely request is made, the right to a refund of the unexpended funds shall be considered waived. 
(g)  Disaster warning siren map. The city secretary shall maintain a disaster warning siren map open to public inspection, indicating the sphere of influence of the early warning sirens put in place. 
(Code 1982, § 24-73; Ord. No. 98-11, § 2, 4-6-1998) 
Sec. 38-403. - Penalties, sanctions, and redeterminations. 
(a)  Requirements to be satisfied prior to development. It shall be unlawful for any person who is required to pay the disaster warning siren fee, as required by this article, to begin, or allow any other person or contractor to begin, any construction or improvements on any land within the development to which this article applies, until the required payment is made to the city in accordance with this article. 
(b)  Permits and services to be withheld. No building permits shall be issued for, and no permanent utility services shall be provided to, any land within any development to which this article applies until the required payment of the disaster warning siren fee is made to the city in accordance with this article. 
(c)  Request for adjustment. A request for adjustment to the disaster warning siren fee must be submitted in writing to the city manager. Adjustments shall only be granted upon: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the adjustment would result in exceptional; 
(3)  Hardship to the applicant; and 
(4)  A determination that the granting of an adjustment will not result in increased threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
All determinations made by the city manager shall be final.

Intermediate leveling and cover shall be required at intervals not to exceed 30 days for filling operations that will exceed 30 days in duration. In areas where fill is being placed to control erosion, the city engineer may substitute an alternate cover that is resistant to erosion for the requirement to cover fill with topsoil. 
(Ord. No. 14-32, § 3, 8-4-2014) 
Sec. 38-437. - Issuance of permits; criteria. 
(a)  The city engineer's office shall issue permits for the grading, filling, excavating or otherwise disturbing the surface of real property upon satisfaction of the following criteria: 
(1)  Applicant provides adequate assurance that the city will be reimbursed for any expense of cleaning or removal of dirt, rock, debris or other pollutants from city streets, alleys, utility facilities, rights-of-way and easements or the barricading thereof by the posting of a deposit of cash with the city to guarantee same. 
(2)  The amount of such deposit shall be established by the city council from time to time and is hereby established as follows: 
Area Amount One acre or less $500.00 minimum From one acre up  100.00 for each additional acre  
(3)  The applicant provides a notarized statement from the property owner giving permission for the applicant to fill, grade, excavate or otherwise disturb the property and acknowledgment by property owner of the responsibilities of the property owner as described in section 38-30 of this Code. 
(4)  Submission by the applicant of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWP3) for all work disturbing one acre of land or more. This storm water pollution prevention plan (SWP3) must be prepared by a licensed professional engineer in accordance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regulations and approved by the city engineer prior to issuing the grading permit. 
(5)  Submission by the applicant of a copy of notice of intent (NOI) and or a construction site notice (CSN) as required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regulations for all work disturbing one acre of land or more. 
(6)  The city engineer may exclude that portion of tracts in excess of ten acres that he/she determines to be so situated as to not contribute to erosion due to location and topography. 
(b)  If removal by the city of soil, rock, mud and debris from its streets, alleys, utility facilities, rights-of-way or easements is required by reason of work performed on property for which a deposit has been made pursuant to subsection (a), reasonable charges shall be billed to the applicant and subtracted from balance of the applicant's deposit. The city will attempt to notify applicant to clean the affected area unless deemed an emergency requiring immediate attention. 
(c)  Upon written request by the applicant to the city engineer, the unused portion of the applicant's deposit shall be refunded if the following criteria is met: 
(1)  The site for which the deposit exists has been stabilized against erosion; and permanent ground cover has been established. 
(2)  No further hazard of erosion is present at the site; 
(3)  All temporary erosion control structures have been removed; 
(4)  Permanent erosion control facilities are in place and functioning properly as designed; and 
(5)  The city engineer or his designee has given written acceptance of public improvements. 
(d)  An applicant who has submitted a written request for return of their deposit who meets the requirements of subsection (c) shall be refunded all funds not used to reimburse the city for the removal of soil, rock, mud, debris and pollutants from its streets, alleys, utility facilities, drainage facilities, rights-of-way or easements. Should an applicant fail to meet all requirements for a refund, the applicant's request will be rejected until such time as they are met. When the requirements have been met, the funds subject to refund will be sent via first class mail to the address on the applicant's grading permit application or if such address has been updated pursuant to application instructions to the applicant's updated address. If the refund mailed to the applicant is returned by the United States Postal Service as undeliverable, the funds shall be forfeited to the city and placed in the general fund if city council is unable to determine the legal address. 
(e)  If a written request for return of a deposit is not made within two years of the date the project on the property for which the deposit has been made receives written acceptance from the city engineer or his designee of the public improvements, the unused portion of the applicant's deposit shall be forfeited to the city and placed in the general fund after the city notifies the applicant. 
(f)  Grading permits shall be valid for two years after date of issuance by the city. Grading permits may be extended for one additional year (for a total of three years) upon written request by the applicant to the city engineer. The city engineer will have the site inspected to verify compliance with the permit conditions and the provisions of the submitted SWP3 before making the permit extension. Failure of the applicant to maintain compliance with the permit conditions and the provisions of the submitted SWP3 shall be adequate cause to deny a request for grading permit extension.

(Code 1982, § 25.5-34; Ord. No. 99-47, § 9, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 9, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-77. - Applicability.

(b)  Section 42-87, pertaining to indemnity, applies to a provider that has a property interest in a network. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-35; Ord. No. 99-47, § 10, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 10, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-78. - Compensation to city. 
    A provider shall compensate the city by payment of the fees as provided in this section: 
(1)  Access line fee calculation. To compensate the city for the use of the rights-of-way, a provider whose telecommunications network is used to serve persons in the city shall pay the city a monthly fee to be calculated as provided in this section for each access line owned or used by the provider, as calculated as of month-end, that is activated for use by an end-user customer of the provider or of another person as a certificated telecommunications utility, by lease or otherwise, subject to subsection (6) of this section or of any other person. 
a.  Access line fee calculation amount. 
1.  Following the effective date of the municipal consent, a provider shall submit to the city manager, on a quarterly basis, a certified statement together with the access line fee payment under section 42-79, indicating the number of access lines used to provide telecommunications service at month end, for each month of the quarter and for each customer class identified in this section. The statement shall be provided on a form prescribed by the city manager. 
2.  For each month of the quarter following the effective date of the municipal consent, a provider shall pay an access line fee which is based upon its number of access lines calculated as follows: 
Access Line Fee Monthly Calculation Amount, Type (1) or (2) 
Residential ..... $1.03 
Nonresidential ..... $2.64 
b.  The city reserves the right to make reasonable adjustments to the access line fee, with 180 days' notice, but not to exceed ten percent in any one year. 
c.  Amounts appearing in this subsection are used to calculate the total compensation due the city and are not to be construed as the setting of a charge for end-users. 
d.  To the extent allowed by law, and not at the direction or request of the city, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Utilities Code § 54.206, a provider has the discretion to collect the access line fee imposed by the city pursuant to this article through a pro rata charge to the customers in the boundaries of the city, including from any other persons who are leasing, reselling, rebundling or otherwise using the provider's access lines to provide telecommunications service. 
e.  For purposes of this section only, lines terminating at customers with "Lifeline," "Tel-Assistance," or other service that is required to be similarly discounted pursuant to state or federal law or regulation for the purpose of advancing universal service to the economically disadvantages shall not be included in the lines upon which the fee is calculated, but the provider shall provide information on the number of such lines upon request by the city. 
f.  Number of access lines. Subject to the city's agreement not to disclose this information unless required by law, the provider agrees to provide annually or as requested by the city, within a reasonable time after receipt of the city's written request, a report showing the number of access lines being maintained or operated by the provider that are serving premises within the city. The city agrees that the report shall be used solely for the purposes of verifying the number of provider's access lines service premises within the city. Upon written request, a provider shall verify the information in the report and, upon reasonable advance notice, all noncustomer specific records and other documents required for such verification shall be subject to inspection by the city expressly excluding any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 USC 2701 et seq.). 
(2)  Minimum annual fee. Notwithstanding any other provision in this article, for all new installations of facilities placed in, on or under the public rights-of-way from the effective date of the municipal consent, and for each calendar year period thereafter, the provider shall pay the city a minimum annual public street crossing fee of either the greater of: 
a.  The access line fee; or 
b.  $250.00. 
This annual minimum fee is to compensate the city for the reasonable rental value of the public rights-of-way used by the provider, and to recover the administrative cost in monitoring and enforcing the provisions of this article and of the municipal consent. Each municipal consent shall provide that the minimum fee of subsection (2)b of this section may be adjusted once every three years by the city in its sole reasonable discretion to properly reflect the reasonable rental value of the public rights-of-way and administrative cost to the city, but such adjustment shall not exceed $100.00 in any one three-year period. 
(3)  Confidential records. If the provider notifies the city by a conspicuous written notation of the confidential nature of any information including, but not limited to, the information in subsection (6)b of this section, reports, documents, or writings, the city agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the information, reports, documents, and writings to the extent permitted by law. Upon receipt by the city of requests for the provider's confidential information, reports, documents, or writings, the city shall notify the provider or the request in writing by facsimile transmission. The city shall furnish the provider with copies of all requests for attorney general opinions pertaining to the provider's confidential information, reports, documents, or writings. The city shall request an attorney general's opinion before disclosing any confidential information, reports, documents or writings, and shall furnish the provider with copies of attorney general opinion requests as soon as practicable that may pertain to the provider's confidential information, reports, documents or writings. 
(4)  No other fees. The payments due under this section shall be in lieu of any construction, building or other permit, approval, inspection, or other similar fees or charges including, but not limited to, all general business permit fees customarily assessed by the city for the use of the public rights-of-way against persons operating business similar to that of a provider. Further, such access line fee shall constitute full compensation to the city for all the provider's facilities located within the public rights-of-way, including interoffice-transport and other transmission medial that do not terminate at an end-user customer's network interface device, even though those types of lines are not used in the calculation of the public rights-of-way fee. The compensation paid in this article is not in lieu of any generally applicable ad valorem taxes, sales taxes and other generally applicable taxes, fees, development impact fees or charges, or other statutory charges or expenses recoverable under the Texas Public Utility Regulator Act, or successor statutes. 
(5)  Uncollectibles. Any other provision of this agreement notwithstanding, the provider shall not be obligated to pay the city for any access lines or private line termination points the revenues for which remain uncollectible. 
(6)  Payments by or use of the network by other telecommunications carriers and providers. 
a.  Direct payment facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers. To the extent allowed by applicable state and federal law, any telecommunications service providers who purchase unbundled network elements or other facilities or services for the purpose of rebundling those facilities and/or services to create telecommunications service for sale to persons within the city ("rebundler") must pay to the city the access line fee that is calculated as of month-end by applying the appropriate access line fee, as specified in this section, to each access line created by rebundling telecommunications service or facilities. Direct payment further ensures that the access line fee imposed in subsection (1) of this section can be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis to all telecommunications service providers that sell telecommunications service within the city. Other provisions of this article notwithstanding, the provider shall not include in its monthly count of access lines any facilities or services provided to other telecommunications service providers for rebundling into telecommunications service, if the telecommunications service provider who is rebundling those facilities for resale has provided a signed statement to the provider that the telecommunications service provider is paying the access line fees applicable to those rebundled services directly to the city. If the provider provides a copy of the signed statement to the city from the rebundler which is acceptable to the city, then the provider is absolved of any responsibility of the access line fees payable on the services, unbundled network facilities, and other facilities rebundled for the creation of telecommunications service for sale within the city by each such rebundler. 
b.  Indirect payments-Public rights-of-way fee application to use of network by others. With respect to any person leasing, reselling, or otherwise using a provider's access lines, if a provider believes it does not have sufficient information to determine the appropriate rate to apply, then the higher access line fee may be applied until such time as the person using the access lines provides to the provider sufficient written information to determine the correct access line fee. If a person provides sufficient written information for the application of the access line fee, the provider may, at its discretion and not at the city's request, bill the person on the basis of the information provided. The provider shall provide to the city any information regarding the locations to which it is providing service or facilities for use by another person for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers, so long as the city first obtains written permission of such other person for the provider to provide the information to the city. Any other provision of this article notwithstanding, however, a provider shall not be liable for underpayment of access line fees resulting from the provider's reliance upon the written information provided by any person who uses the provider's services or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-36; Ord. No. 99-47, § 11, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 11, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-79. - City payment due dates. 
(a)  Access line fee. A provider shall remit the access line fee on a quarterly basis, together with the certified statement required in section 42-78(1)a. Payment shall be made on or before the 45th day following the close of each calendar quarter for which the payment is calculated and shall be paid by wire transfer to an account designated by the city manager. 
(b)  Minimum fee payment. This fee per section 42-78(2), if applicable, shall be due on January 31 of every year of the consent agreement. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-37; Ord. No. 99-47, § 12, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 12, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-80. - Audits. 
(a)  On 30 days' notice to a provider the city may audit a provider for a period of time to the fullest extent allowed by law. The provider shall furnish information to demonstrate its compliance with the municipal consent and/or other provision of this article. 
(b)  A provider shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts and records of business and operations that cumulatively reflect the monthly count of all access lines for a period of seven years. The city manager may require the keeping of additional records or accounts that are reasonably necessary for purposes of identifying, accounting for, and reporting the number of access lines used to deliver telecommunication services or for calculation of the payments due under this article. The city may examine the provider's books and records referred to in the article, expressly excluding any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 USC 2701 et seq.), to the extent such records reasonably relate to providing information to verify compliance with this article and municipal consent. 
(c)  A provider shall make available to the city or the city's designated agent (hereinafter "agent"), for the city or its agent to examine, audit, review and copy, in the city, on the city manager's written request, its books and records, referred to in this article, including papers, books, accounts, documents, maps, plans and other provider records that pertain to municipal consent conditions and requirements obtained under this article. A provider shall fully cooperate in making records available and otherwise assist the city examiner. The city examiner shall not inspect or copy or otherwise demand production of customer specific information or any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 USC 2701 et seq.). 
(d)  The city manager may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to the providers' performance of the terms and conditions of a municipal consent conveyed under this article. The providers shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. 
(e)  Upon written request by the city manager, to the extent the documents are reasonably identified, the providers shall furnish to the city within 30 business days from the date of the written request copies of all public petitions, applications, written communications and reports submitted by the providers, to the FCC and/or to the PUC or their successor agencies, relating to any matters affecting the physical use of city public rights-of-way. 
(f)  The provisions of this section shall be continuing and shall survive the termination of a municipal consent granted under this article and shall extend beyond the term of the municipal consent granted to the provider and the city shall have all the rights described in this section for so long as the provider is providing any telecommunications service within the city. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-38; Ord. No. 99-47, § 13, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 13, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-81. - Nontransferable. 
(a)  No municipal consent or any rights or privileges that a provider has under a municipal consent, or the facilities held by a provider for use under such municipal consent which are in the public rights-of-way, shall be sold, resold, assigned, transferred or conveyed by the provider, either separately or collectively, to any other person, without the prior written approval of the city by ordinance or resolution. The city's approval shall be based upon the transferee providing adequate information to the city that it has the ability to perform and comply with the obligations and requirements of the municipal consent. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Should a provider sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests under its municipal consent, including such provider's telecommunications network, or attempt to do so, without the city's prior consent, the city may revoke the provider's municipal consent for default, in which event all rights and interest of the provider under the municipal consent shall cease. 
(b)  Any transfer in violation of this section shall be null and void and unenforceable. Any change of control of a provider shall constitute a transfer under this section. However, such a change in control shall not void the municipal consent as to the transferee, unless and until the city has given notice that such a change in control necessitates compliance with this section. If the provider does not initiate compliance with this section by a request for municipal consent within 30 days after the required notice has been given by the city, the municipal consent shall be null and unenforceable as to the transferee. 
(c)  There shall be a rebuttable presumption of a change of control of a provider upon a change of 15 percent or greater in the ownership of such provider. Such a change in control shall be deemed a transfer which requires consent of the city. 
(d)  A mortgage or other pledge of assets to a bank or lending institution in a bona fide lending transaction shall not be considered an assignment or transfer. 
(e)  Every municipal consent granted under this section shall specify that any transfer or other disposition of rights which has the effect of circumventing payment of required access line fees or minimum fees and/or evasion of payment of such fees by failure to accurately count or report the number of access lines by a provider is prohibited. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything else in this section, if the city has not approved or denied a request to transfer under this section within 120 days of written notice of such request from the provider to the city, it shall be deemed approved. Such time frame may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, a provider may transfer, without city approval, the facilities in the public rights-of-way under a municipal consent to another provider who has a municipal consent under this article. The provider transferring the facilities remains subject to all applicable obligations and provisions of the municipal consent unless the provider to which the facilities are transferred is also subject to the same, as applicable, obligations and provisions. The provider transferring the facilities must give written notice of the transfer to the city manager. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-39; Ord. No. 99-47, § 14, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 14, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-82. - Notices to city. 
(a)  A provider shall notify the city manager as is provided in the consent agreement. 
(b)  A provider shall give written notice to the city not later than 15 days before a transfer or change in operations that may affect the applicability of sections 42-85, 42-86, and 42-87, to the provider. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-40; Ord. No. 99-47, § 15, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 15, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-83. - Circumvention of fee prohibited. 
    A person may not circumvent payment of access line fees or evade payment of such fees by bartering, transfer of rights, or by any other means that result in undercounting a provider's number of lines. Capacity or services may be bartered if the imputed lines are reported in accordance with section 42-78. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-41; Ord. No. 99-47, § 16, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 16, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-84. - Construction obligations. 
(a)  A provider is subject to the reasonable regulation of the city to manage its public rights-of-way pursuant to the city's rights as a custodian of public property under state and federal laws. A provider is subject to city ordinances and requirements and federal and state laws and regulations in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  At the city's request, a provider shall furnish the city accurate and complete information relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance, operation and repair of facilities performed by the provider in the public rights-of-way. 
(c)  The construction, expansion, reconstruction, excavation, use, maintenance and operation of a provider's facilities within the public rights-of-way are subject to applicable city requirements. 
(1)  A provider may be required to place certain facilities within the public rights-of-way underground according to applicable city requirements absent a compelling demonstration by the provider that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable or feasible nor is it equally applicable to other similar users of the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A provider shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations on other similar users of the public rights-of-way. The city shall waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the provider. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. A provider shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(3)  A provider must obtain a permit, as reasonably required by applicable city codes, prior to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation or maintenance of the provider's facilities. Once a permit is issued, the provider shall give to the city a minimum of 48-hours' notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of the activities of its network listed in this section in, on or under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the provider to request and obtain a permit from the city prior to performing any of the activities in this section in, on or over any public rights-of-way, except in any emergency as provided for in subsection (10) of this section, will subject the provider to a stop work order from the city and enforcement action pursuant to this Code. If the provider fails to act upon any permit within 90 calendar days of issuance, the permit shall become invalid, and the provider will be required to obtain another permit. 
(4)  When a provider completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation or other work, the provider shall promptly restore the rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. A provider shall replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base, irrigation system and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance, or repair of the provider's facilities within 30 calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the time of the work. 
(5)  Upon failure of a provider to perform any such repair or replacement work, and five days after written notice has been given by the city to the provider, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been disturbed by the provider, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the provider will reimburse the city for the costs so incurred within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(6)  Should the city reasonably determine, within two years from the date of the completion of the repair work, that the surface, base, irrigation system or landscape treatment requires additional restoration work to meet existing standards of the city, a provider shall perform such additional restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies as provided in this article. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the city determines that the failure of a provider to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts. A provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(8)  A provider shall furnish the city with construction plans and maps showing the location and proposed routing of a new construction or reconstruction at least 15 days (subject to subsection (d) of this section), before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way. A provider may not begin construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing. 
(9)  If the city manager declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, a provider shall remove or abate the provider's facilities by the deadline provided in the city manager's request. The provider and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to ensure continuity of service. If the provider, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the provider, without paying compensation to the provider and without the city incurring liability for damages. 
(10)  Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent harm to property or person ("emergency conditions"), a provider may not excavate the pavement of a street or public rights-of-way without first complying with city requirements. The city manager or his designee shall be notified immediately regarding work performed under such emergency conditions, and the provider shall comply with the requirements of city standards for the restoration of the public rights-of-way. 
(11)  Within 60 days of completion of each new permitted section of a provider's facilities, the provider shall supply the city with a complete set of "as-built" drawings for the segment in a format used in the ordinary course of the provider's business and as reasonably prescribed by the city, and as allowed by law. 
(12)  The city may require reasonable bonding requirements of a provider, as are required of other entities that place facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  In determining whether any requirement under this section is unreasonable or unfeasible, the city manager or his designee shall consider, among other things, whether the requirement would subject the provider to an unreasonable increase in risk of service interruption, or to an unreasonable increase in liability for accidents, or to an unreasonable delay in construction or in availability of its services, or to any other unreasonable technical or economic burden. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-42; Ord. No. 99-47, § 17, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 17, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-85. - Conditions of public rights-of-way occupancy. 
(a)  In the exercise of governmental functions, the city has first priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way. The city reserves the right to lay sewer, gas, water, and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, and to do underground and overhead work, and attachments, restructuring or changes in serial facilities, across, along, over or under a public street, alley or public rights-of-way occupied by a provider, and to change the curb, sidewalks of the grade of streets. 
(b)  The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among competing users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each user type, and to the extent there is limited space available for additional users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law. 
(c)  If, during the term of a municipal consent, the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley or public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the provider. If the city closes or abandons a public rights-of-way that contains a portion of a provider's facilities, the city shall close or abandon such public rights-of-way subject to the rights conveyed in the municipal consent. 
(d)  If the city gives written notice, the provider shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of the provider's facilities that are in the public rights-of-way within 120 days, except in circumstances that require additional time as reasonably determined by the city based upon information provided by the provider. For projects expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, change or relocate, the city will confer with the provider before determining the alterations to be required and the timing thereof. The city shall give notice whenever the city has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation of a city or other governmental public improvement in the public rights-of-way. This section shall not be construed to prevent a provider's recovery of the cost of relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for relocation or removal, nor shall it be required if improvements are solely for beautification purposes without prior joint deliberation and agreement with the provider. If the provider fails to relocate facilities in the time allowed by the city in this section, the provider may be subject to liability to the city for such delay and as set forth in the city codes or ordinance, now or hereafter enacted. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (d), the city manager and a provider may agree in writing to different timeframes than those provided in this subsection if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change. 
(e)  During the term of its municipal consent, a provider may trim trees in or over the rights-of-way for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its network. All tree trimming shall be performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the city. Should the provider, its contractor or agent fail to remove such trimmings within 24 hours, the city may remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of a bill from the city, the provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred within 30 working days. 
(f)  A provider shall temporarily remove, raise or lower its serial facilities to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures, if the city gives written notice of no less than 48 hours. The expense of these temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting and benefiting from the temporary rearrangements. The provider may require prepayment or the prior posting of a bond from the party requesting temporary move. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-43; Ord. No. 99-47, § 18, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 18, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-86. - Insurance requirements. 
(a)  A provider shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts reasonably prescribed by the city with an insurance company licensed to do business in the state acceptable to the city throughout the term of a municipal consent conveyed under this article. A provider shall furnish the city with proof of insurance at the time of filing the acceptance of a municipal consent. The city reserves the right to review the insurance requirements during the effective period of a municipal consent, and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and units when the city manager determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims history of the industry or the provider require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the state or letters written by the provider in those instances where the state does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required herein. However, for the city to accept such letters the provider must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the city, based on financial information requested by and furnished to the city. The city's current insurance requirements are described in "Exhibit A" attached to the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(b)  The provider shall furnish, at no cost to the city, copies of certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required by this section to the city. The city may request the deletion, revision or modification of particular policy terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions, unless the policy provisions are established by a law or regulation binding the city, the provider, or the underwriter. If the city requests a deletion, revision or modification, a provider shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to accomplish the change. 
(c)  An insurance certificate shall contain the following required provisions: 
(1)  Name the city and its officers, employees, board members and elected representatives as additional insureds for all applicable coverage; 
(2)  Provide for 30 days' notice to the city for cancellation, nonrenewal, or material change; 
(3)  Provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the city manager by certified mail; and 
(4)  Provide that the terms of the municipal consent which impose obligations on the provider concerning liability, duty, and standard of care, including the indemnity section, are included in the policy and that the risks are insured within the policy terms and conditions. 
(d)  The provider shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the city manager during the term of a municipal consent or an extension or renewal. An insurance certificate obtained in compliance with this section is subject to city approval. The city may require the certificate to be changed to reflect changing liability limits. A provider shall immediately advise the city attorney of actual or potential litigation that may develop which may affect an existing carrier's obligation to defend and indemnify. 
(e)  An insurer has no right of recovery against the city. The required insurance policies shall protect the provider and the city. The insurance shall be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies. 
(f)  The policy clause "other insurance" shall not apply to the city if the city is an insured under the policy. 
(g)  The provider shall pay premiums and assessments. A company which issues an insurance policy has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a provider must provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the city in connection with the damage covered by the policy. 
(Code 1982, § 25.5-44; Ord. No. 99-47, § 19, 8-30-1999; Ord. No. 99-39, § 19, 9-7-1999) 
Sec. 42-87. - Indemnity.

Sec. 44-30. - Pro rata charges. 
(a)  The water works department may extend water and sanitary sewer mains in the streets and alleys, or easements, within the city limits in order to permit connections by persons desiring and seeking water service and sanitary sewer service. A charge, which shall be known as the "pro rata," shall be made against each lot or tract of land, and the owner thereof, whose water or sewer lines shall be hereafter connected with any water mains or sewer mains of the city. The charge shall be at per front foot rates, as established by the city council from time to time by resolution, which rates are a portion of the total cost of such water and sewer mains. 
(b)  The front foot rates mentioned in subsection (a) of this section shall apply to property fronting on a street in areas platted into the usual rectangular lots or tracts of land, with a depth not to exceed 150 feet. Where lots or tracts have greater depth than 150 feet from the front street line, and are occupied, or are to be occupied exclusively as dwelling places, the additional depth shall not be assessed. If the property is later subdivided, requiring an extension of mains to serve the same, then the terms of this article shall govern. On lots or tracts of land which extend through from one street to another, with frontage on both streets, and where the distance between the street lines is 260 feet or more, then the pro rata charges provided for in subsection (a) of this section shall be paid on both frontages when a connection is secured to the lot or tract. Where lots or tracts of land are irregular in size or shape, the pro rata charges shall be based upon equivalent rectangular lots or tracts using one front foot for each 150 square feet of area, or the pro rata charges provided in this section on average frontage of such tracts, whichever is smaller. 
(c)  Where lots or tracts are intended to be used for business, commercial or industrial purposes, or have a depth greater than 150 feet from the front street line, then the pro rata charges provided in this section shall be paid on the frontage on all streets which the property may abut, minus 150 feet frontage for each corner of the property abutting a street intersection. Should such property be resubdivided whereby water or sewer main extensions are required to serve the same, the terms of this article shall apply and additional pro rata charges shall be made based on such additional street frontage. 
(d)  In addition to the pro rata charge on water and sewer mains, the property owner must pay the tap charges as established from time to time by city council resolution. 
(Code 1982, § 26-17; Ord. of 1-7-1963, § 2; Ord. No. 82-47, § 1, 9-27-1982) 
Sec. 44-31. - Extension of water and sewer lines-Generally. 
(a)  Upon request of the owner, or his agent, of a given lot or tract of land, for the purpose of this article known as the applicant, accompanied by the payment of the charges due under this article, the city shall extend or cause to have extended, lay or construct all necessary sanitary sewer and water mains, including valves and hydrants, a distance of 100 feet plus the distance across the frontage necessary to provide the service for which application has been made. The applicant to be served shall be required to pay the charges provided for in this section. The owners of all intervening property served by the given main extensions shall be required to pay the charges provided for in this section at such time as their property is connected to the mains thus laid. Where an applicant for service secured an extension and service under this particular option for main extension, he shall pay the pro rata charges on all property owned by him and which is served by the requested extension. In applying the 100-foot rule, the required extension of the main shall be figured in such a manner as to leave out of the calculation of that portion of any main adjacent to property already having other than a temporary water service and for which the pro rata charge thereon has been paid or credited under the terms of this article. 
(b)  An exception to the 100-foot rule mentioned in subsection (a) of this section shall be made where two or more individual applicants desire water and/or sewer service and the nearest applicant is more than 100 feet from existing lines, the city will extend or cause to have extended their mains upon payment of the charge due under this article, provided there is one customer for every 100 feet of such extension, excluding street intersections and that portion of the extension adjacent to property already having other than temporary water and/or sewer service. 
(Code 1982, § 26-18; Ord. of 1-7-1963, § 3) 
Sec. 44-32. - Same-Alternative method. 
    At the option of the city, the following method for extending water and sewer mains may be used where the applicant's property is more than 100 feet from an existing water or sewer main. This method shall be available only for use by an individual owner, person or corporation to secure water and sewer service for the individual's residence or place of business. Where eligible for this option, the owner may advance and pay into the city the entire pro rata cost as established by the council from time to time by resolution, for water extensions and for sewer extensions on all property served by the desired main extension, and the city, when such money has been actually deposited with the city, will construct or cause to have constructed the desired water or sewer main along the street, alley or easement. When any property for which such person has advanced the pro rata cost is connected to such main extension, then, in that event, the pro rata cost so advanced on that particular property shall be refunded by the city to the person making the original deposit. Where an extension is requested by an industry or commercial concern using large quantities of water and cannot meet the requirements of one customer per 100 feet of extension, such extension may be made at the discretion of the city council, provided 40 percent of the estimated annual revenue from such customer will support interest and principal payments on a ten year loan covering the cost of such extension, such loan bearing interest at a rate of six percent per annum. 
(Code 1982, § 26-19; Ord. of 1-7-1963, § 4) 
Sec. 44-33. - Refund of cost of extension. 
(a)  Where extensions of water and sewer mains are required to serve property which has been subdivided or platted for development and resale and the final plat has been approved by the city council, the city shall construct or cause to have constructed such mains upon deposit of the total cost of such extensions, including the cost of approach mains fronting property not owned by the developer, but necessary to connect the area for which application is made with the city water and sewer system. 
(b)  The developer will bear the total cost of construction of off-site or approaching mains required to interconnect property to be developed with existing mains, the sizes to be determined by the city, and with the only refunds to be the pro rata as collected by the water department. 
(c)  Any refund to the developer shall not exceed the total of the pro rata charges if this means has been used to calculate the cost of water and sewer mains. 
(d)  In the event the construction of the ten-inch or 12-inch line exceeds the pro rata charge provided under this article, then the owner of abutting property shall pay one-half of the actual cost of installing the line. Such cost shall apply to each side abutting such line. 
(e)  There shall be a maximum of ten years as the period of eligibility wherein the original depositor may request a refund or pro rata payments under this section. In the event the abutting property is not developed during such ten-year period, then no refund shall be made under this section. The period of eligibility shall begin as of the date of final inspection and acceptance of the extensions by the city. 
(Code 1982, § 26-20; Ord. of 1-7-1963, § 5)

(Code 1982, § 26-23; Ord. of 1-7-1963, § 8) 
Sec. 44-36. - Method of enforcing payment. 
    Nothing in this article shall be deemed in any way to be an exclusive method of enforcing the payment of the pro rata cost against the consumer and property owners, and shall not be deemed in any manner to be a waiver of the city's right to validly assess the property owners and/or consumers concerned for cost of the installation of standard size water and sewer mains and to fix and enforce liens against such property, all which may be done as provided by ordinance in the manner prescribed by law. 
(Code 1982, § 26-24; Ord. of 1-7-1963, § 9)

(c)  When the project is ready for construction, line and grade stakes will be set by the developer's engineer; but these stakes will not be set until after the developer's engineer has properly staked on the ground with iron pins all points of curves, all points of tangency, all block corners, and all lot corners within the subdivision. All construction and installation of water and sewer mains shall be supervised by inspectors of the city. 
(d)  Specifications for materials and performance shall be as approved and adopted by the city. 
(e)  Upon approval of the plans by the city, the developer may enter into a contract with any individual or may himself construct the system as so planned; provided, however, that the construction and installation of the water lines and sewer lines, or either of them, shall be supervised by inspectors of the city, to see that the installation is made in accordance with the plans and specification approved and adopted by the city which, in every instance, shall be a part of such installation contract. 
(f)  No installation of water and sewer mains shall be made at any other location except the dedicated street, alley, or an easement running in favor of the city, which shall be filed of record by the owner of such addition.

(2)  The city may set limits on a permit by permit basis for any other parameter that would pose a threat to water quality, health and safety, or the POTW or the discharge of which would otherwise result in violation of section 44-137 of this division, including but not limited to, priority pollutants found in the POTW influent at a concentration at or above 0.1 mg/L or numerical aquatic life criteria as defined by TCEQ. 
(3)  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes without prior written permission from the environmental officer. 
(b)  The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. The environmental officer may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above. 
(c)  Dilution is prohibited as a substitute for treatment. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The environmental officer may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-139. - Federal categorical pretreatment standards. 
    The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 C.F.R. chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated. 
(1)  Upon the promulgation of a categorical pretreatment standard for a particular industrial category or subcategory, the categorical pretreatment standard, if more stringent than specific local limits imposed under this division for industrial users subject to that categorical standard, shall supersede the local limits imposed under this division. 
(2)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the environmental officer may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c). 
(3)  Where industrial users combine wastestreams prior to treatment, compliance with an applicable categorical pretreatment standard will be determined either prior to combining the wastestreams or following treatment of the combined wastestream (by applying the combined wastestream formula found in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e)). 
(4)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 C.F.R. § 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(5)  An industrial user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.15. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003)

Sec. 44-142. - Compliance with other authorities. 
(a)  Compliance with federal authority. Industrial users within the jurisdiction of this division shall comply with all federal general pretreatment regulations and with those categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each as specified in 40 C.F.R. chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405-471. 
(b)  Compliance with state authority. Industrial users within the jurisdiction of this division shall comply with applicable sections of chapter 26 of the Texas Water Code. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-143. - Industrial user wastewater discharge permit requirements. 
(a)  All nondomestic users shall notify the environmental officer of the nature and characteristics of their wastewater prior to commencing their discharge. The environmental officer is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose. All nondomestic users must complete the industrial user wastewater discharge permit application, the industrial waste survey, and/or other forms as identified by the environmental officer. If a nondomestic user fails to complete any form identified as required by the environmental officer, the nondomestic user will be in violation of this division. The environmental officer may periodically require industrial users to update this information. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for significant industrial users to discharge wastewater, whether directly or indirectly, into the POTW without first obtaining an industrial user wastewater discharge permit from the city. Any violation of the terms and conditions of an industrial user wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this division and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in sections 44-153, 44-169, and 44-170 of this division. Obtaining an industrial user wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to obtain any other permits required by federal, state, or local law. 
(c)  The environmental officer may require that other industrial users, including liquid waste haulers, obtain industrial user wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article. The environmental officer also may prohibit the disposal of hauled pollutants, including hauled wastewater. The discharge of hauled pollutants, including hauled wastewater, is subject to all other requirements of this division. 
(1)  Industrial waste haulers, including haulers of wastewater, may discharge loads only at locations designed by the environmental officer. 
(2)  No load may be discharged without prior consent of the environmental officer. 
(3)  The environmental officer may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. 
(4)  The environmental officer may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
(5)  Industrial waste haulers, including haulers of wastewater, must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. 
(d)  All existing significant industrial users connected to or contributing to the POTW shall obtain an industrial user wastewater discharge permit within 180 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives. The application must be submitted to the environmental officer within 90 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives. 
(e)  New connections: Any significant industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging nondomestic wastes into the POTW must obtain an industrial user wastewater discharge permit prior to beginning or recommencing such discharge. An application form must be filed by the SIU at least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge. Categorical SIUs must provide an application form and a supplemental baseline monitoring report, the two of which are to contain the information required by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12, as set out in section 44-144. 
(f)  The environmental officer may deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants, to the POTW by industrial users where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate its TPDES permit. 
(g)  Reapplication: Once permitted, the industrial user has the duty to reapply if the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by the permit after the expiration date of the industrial user wastewater discharge permit. The industrial user must submit an application for a new permit at least 90 days before the expiration of the permit. The application form may be obtained from the environmental officer. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-144. - Industrial user wastewater discharge permit application and baseline monitoring report. 
(a)  All significant industrial users required to obtain an industrial user wastewater discharge permit shall complete and file with the environmental officer, an application upon a form provided by the city. The city may charge a permit application fee, which if charged, shall accompany the application. 
(b)  The environmental officer shall issue an industrial user wastewater discharge permit if he/she determines that pretreatment facilities are adequate for efficient treatment and that discharged wastes will comply with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, including those imposed by this division. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the industrial user for revision. 
(c)  Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination under 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall be required to submit to the environmental officer an industrial user wastewater discharge permit application and a baseline monitoring report, the two of which shall contain the information identified in paragraphs (1) through (6), below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, New Sources, and sources that become subject to categorical standards subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the environmental officer a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (1) through (5), below. New sources shall also be required to include this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. New sources shall give estimates to the information requested in paragraphs (4) and (5). 
(1)  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operators and owners. 
(2)  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
(3)  Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and the standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. The user shall submit a list of all chemicals utilized in its processes and appropriate material safety data sheets (MSDSs). 
(4)  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
a.  Regulated process streams; and 
b.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e). 
The environmental officer may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants. 
a.  The user shall identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
b.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the categorical pretreatment standards or by the environmental officer) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
c.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The environmental officer may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
d.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. 
e.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the environmental officer. 
f.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where EPA determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures suggested by the environmental officer or other parties, approved by EPA. 
g.  The environmental officer may require the user to submit a pollutant scan of the wastewater discharge. 
h.  The environmental officer may allow the submission of a baseline monitoring report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
i.  The baseline monitoring report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and the industrial user shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(6)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as specified in section 44-150), and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements, the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 44-145. 
(8)  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 C.F.R. § 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 C.F.R. § 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by this section, the information required by paragraphs (6) and (7) shall pertain to the modified limits. 
(9)  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (40 C.F.R. § 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 C.F.R. § 403.13) after the user submits the report required by this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by paragraphs (6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the user to the environmental officer within 60 days after the modified limit is approved. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-145. - Compliance schedule progress reports. 
    The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by subsection 44-144(c)(7): 
(1)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). 
(2)  No increment referred to in section 44-145(1) shall exceed nine months. 
(3)  Not later than 14 days following each date in the compliance schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the environmental officer including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the environmental officer. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-146. - Ninety-day compliance report. 
    Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following the commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the environmental officer a report containing the information described in subsections 44-144(c)(4), (5) and (6). For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the environmental officer in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 44-150. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-147. - Periodic report on continued compliance. 
(a)  Any significant industrial users subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such categorical standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the environmental officer during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the categorical standard or by the environmental officer, TCEQ, or EPA, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by such categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the discharge reported in subsection 44-144(c)(4), except that the environmental officer may require more detailed reporting of flows. At the discretion of the environmental officer and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the environmental officer may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are submitted. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 44-150. 
(b)  Where the environmental officer has imposed mass limitations on an industrial user as provided for by 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(d), the report required by paragraph (a), above, shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standards in the discharge for the industrial user. 
(c)  For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the environmental officer in accordance with the procedures in 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c), the report required by paragraph (a), above, shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by paragraph (a), above, shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. 
(d)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(e)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently that required by the environmental officer, using the procedures prescribed in subsection 44-148(a), the results of this monitoring shall be included in this report. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-148. - Reporting requirements for significant noncategorical industrial users. 
(a)  Significant noncategorical industrial users shall submit to the environmental officer at least once every six months (on dates specified by the environmental officer) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the environmental officer. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the environmental officer or other persons, approved by the EPA. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the environmental officer in lieu of the significant noncategorical industrial user. Where the environmental officer collects all the information required for the report, the noncategorical significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
(b)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 44-150. 
(c)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(d)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently that required by the environmental officer, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (a) above, the results of this monitoring shall be included in this report. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-149. - Permit conditions. 
(a)  Industrial user wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this division and all other applicable regulations, user charges, and fees established by the city.

(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-151. - Permit issuance process. 
(a)  Permit duration. Industrial user wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a specified period, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than five years, at the discretion of the environmental officer. 
(b)  Permit appeals. Any interested person, including the industrial user, may petition to appeal the terms of a permit, or the denial of a permit, to the environmental appeals committee (as established by section 44-154), within 30 days of the final permit decision. 
(1)  Failure to submit to a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal. 
(2)  In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the permit provisions objected to, the reasons for these objections, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to be placed in the permit. Any reasons advanced against a permit denial shall be fully explained. 
(3)  The effectiveness of the permit shall not be stayed pending a reconsideration by the committee, unless the environmental officer expressly so states. If, after considering the petition and any arguments put forth by the environmental officer, the committee determines that reconsideration is proper, it shall remand the permit, or permit application, back to the environmental officer for reconsideration. Those permit provisions being reconsidered by the environmental officer on remand shall be stayed pending reissuance, unless the committee expressly states to the contrary. 
(4)  An environmental appeals committee decision not to reconsider a final permit, or the denial of a permit, shall be considered final administrative action for purposes of judicial review. 
(5)  If the environmental appeals committee fails to act within 30 days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. 
(6)  Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the state district court. 
(c)  Permit action and modification. The environmental officer has the power to deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants, to the POTW by an industrial user where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate the applicable TPDES permit issued for the operation of the POTW. The environmental officer may modify the industrial user wastewater discharge permit for good cause including but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(2)  To address material or substantial alterations or additions to the industrial user's operation processes, or discharge volume or character which were not considered in drafting the effective permit. 
(3)  A change in any condition in either the industrial user or the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge. 
(4)  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the POTW, POTW personnel, or the receiving waters. 
(5)  Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit. 
(6)  Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts in the permit application or in any required reporting. 
(7)  Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical standards pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 403.13. 
(8)  To correct typographical or other errors in the permit. 
(9)  To reflect transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a new owner or operator. 
(10)  Upon request of the permittee, provided such request does not create a violation of any applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or other laws, rules, or regulations. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance, does not stay any permit condition. 
(d)  Permit transfer. Industrial user wastewater discharge permits may be reassigned or transferred to a new owner and/or operator with prior approval of the environmental officer, provided: 
(1)  The permittee must give at least 30 days' advance notice to the environmental officer. 
(2)  The permittee must provide a copy of the existing permit to the new owner or operator. 
(3)  The notice must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
a.  States that the new owner or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes; 
b.  Identifies that the permittee has provided a copy of the existing permit to the new owner or operator; 
c.  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
d.  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing permit. 
(4)  Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the industrial user wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer. 
(e)  Permit termination. Industrial user wastewater discharge permits may be terminated for good cause, including but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Falsifying self-monitoring reports. 
(2)  Tampering with monitoring equipment. 
(3)  Refusing to allow proper inspecting authorities timely access to the facility premises and records. 
(4)  Failure to meet effluent limitations. 
(5)  Failure to pay fines. 
(6)  Failure to pay sewer charges. 
(7)  Failure to meet compliance schedules. 
(8)  Failure to notify the environmental officer of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the changed discharge. 
(9)  Failure to provide prior notification to the environmental officer of changed conditions pursuant to subsection 44-160(c). 
(10)  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the industrial user wastewater discharge permit application. 
(11)  Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the industrial user wastewater discharge permit application. 
(12)  Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility. 
(13)  Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the industrial user wastewater discharge permit or this division. 
A user will be notified of any proposed permit termination and offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection 44-153(h) why the proposed termination should not occur. 
Industrial user wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All industrial user wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new permit to that user. 
(f)  Permit reissuance. The user shall apply for permit reissuance by submitting a complete industrial user wastewater discharge permit application form a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit. 
(g)  Continuation of expired permits. An expired permit will continue to be effective and enforceable until the permit is reissued if: 
(1)  The industrial user has submitted a complete industrial user wastewater discharge permit application form at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the user's permit.

(a)  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the environmental officer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the environmental officer within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. 
(b)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of section 44-147 or section 44-148 monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by this division or by the environmental officer, using the procedures as prescribed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(g)(4), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(c)  Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this division or the industrial user wastewater discharge permit shall retain for a minimum of three years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this division or the industrial user wastewater discharge permit) and shall make available for inspection and copying by the EPA, TCEQ, or the environmental officer. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or the city, when requested by the state or the federal government, or when specifically notified of a longer retention period by the environmental officer. For all samples, such records shall include but not be limited to: 
(1)  The date, exact location, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking the samples; 
(2)  The date analyses were performed;

(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-153. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Telephone call or e-mail communication. After discovery of an industrial user violation, the environmental officer may inform the noncompliant user by telephone or by e-mail communication concerning the violation committed by the user. If by telephone, the environmental officer will speak to the authorized user contact and explain the violation along with the possible enforcement action against the user if the violation continues to occur. The environmental officer will gather the following information: 
(1)  Why the violation occurred; 
(2)  Whether the problem has been corrected; 
(3)  Whether the violation could occur again; and 
(4)  When the problem has been or will be corrected. 
The information received from the contact concerning the violation will be documented along with time and date of call in the violation summary file. Such telephone call may be utilized to provide verbal notification of minor violations. If communication is by e-mail and the industrial user does not provide the above information in a timely manner, the environmental officer will follow-up via telephone. Use of the telephone call or e-mail communication does not limit the environmental officer's ability to take any other action authorized by this plan. 
(b)  Notification of violation. When the environmental officer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an industrial user wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental officer may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the environmental officer. If the user denies that any violation occurred and/or contends that no corrective action is necessary, an explanation of the basis of any such denial or contention shall be submitted to the environmental officer within 15 days of receipt of the notice. Submission of an explanation and/or plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the environmental officer to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(c)  Consent orders. The environmental officer may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents may include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(d)  Show cause hearing. The environmental officer may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an industrial user wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the environmental officer and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Compliance orders. When the environmental officer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an industrial user wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental officer may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time limit. If the user does not come into compliance within the specified time limit, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Cease and desist orders. When the environmental officer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an industrial user wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the environmental officer may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The environmental officer may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after any reasonable notice to the user that is practical under the circumstances, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The environmental officer may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the environmental officer may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The environmental officer may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the environmental officer that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in paragraph (h) of this Section are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the environmental officer prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under paragraph (d) or (h) of this section. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in section 44-151(e), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of industrial user wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of pretreatment standards. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under paragraph (d) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the environmental officer shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(i)  Administrative fines. 
(1)  When the environmental officer finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an industrial user wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental officer may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(3)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(j)  Appeals from administrative enforcement actions. Any industrial user subject to any order issued, any administrative fine imposed, or any enforcement action taken by the environmental officer pursuant to his/her authority in this section may appeal the order, action, or fine by filing a written notice of appeal with the environmental officer (the environmental officer may provide forms for this purpose). Such notice of appeal shall be filed within 15 days of notice of the order, action, or fine. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-154. - Environmental appeals committee. 
(a)  An environmental appeals committee is hereby established, and authorized to hear and decide appeals from any decision, fine, or order issued or any other enforcement action taken by the environmental officer pursuant to this division. The committee shall be composed of the city manager, or assistant city manager, the mayor, and the city attorney, or any of their designated representatives. 
(b)  The committee may call and hold hearings, administer oaths, receive evidence at the hearing, issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers and documents related to the hearing, and make findings of fact and decisions with respect to administering its powers herein. 
(c)  Upon the hearing of an appeal from an order issued, enforcement action taken, or fine imposed by the environmental officer, the committee shall determine if there is a preponderance of evidence to support the environmental officer's determination, fine, action, and/or order. The decision of the committee shall be in writing and contain findings of fact. If the committee determines that there is a preponderance of evidence to support the determination, fine, action, and/or order of the environmental officer, the committee shall, in addition to its decision, issue an order: 
(1)  Requiring discontinuance of the violation or condition; 
(2)  Requiring compliance with any requirement to correct or prevent any condition or violation; 
(3)  Suspending or revoking any industrial user wastewater discharge permit issued under this division; and/or 
(4)  Imposing the proper fine. 
In any decision issued by the committee, the order shall specify the time in which the compliance with the order must be taken. A copy of the order shall be delivered to the appellant or person to whom the order is directed in person or sent to him/her by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested). 
(d)  Upon the hearing of an appeal from a permit issuance, modification, or denial by the environmental officer, the committee shall determine if there is a preponderance of evidence to support the environmental officer's permitting decision. The decision of the committee shall be in writing. If the committee determines that there is a preponderance of evidence to support the permitting decision of the environmental officer, the committee shall affirm his/her decision. If the committee determines that there is not a preponderance of evidence to support the permitting decision of the environmental officer, the committee shall remand the permit, or permit application, back to the environmental officer for reconsideration. A copy of the decision of the committee upon the permitting appeal shall be delivered to the appellant in person or sent to him/her by registered or certified mail. An environmental appeals committee decision not to reconsider a final permit, or denial of a permit, shall be considered final administrative action for purposes of judicial review. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-155. - Determining the character and concentration of wastewater. 
(a)  The wastewater discharged or deposited into the POTW shall be subject to periodic inspection and sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by the environmental officer. Sampling shall be conducted according to 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the EPA. 
(b)  The examination and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be: 
(1)  Performed in accordance with procedures established by the EPA pursuant to section 304(h) of the Act (33 U.S.C. § 1314) and contained in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the EPA. Where 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the environmental officer or other parties, approved by the EPA. 
(2)  Determined from suitable samples taken at the control manhole provided or other control points authorized by the environmental officer provided at the expense of the industry. 
(c)  The environmental officer may select an independent firm or laboratory to perform sampling and laboratory analyses. 
(d)  The determination of the character and concentration of industrial wastewater shall be made by the environmental officer at such times and on such schedules as he/she may establish. 
(e)  The environmental officer may require any industrial user to compensate NTMWD and/or the city, as appropriate, for the costs of sampling, analyses of the discharges, and any additional administrative fees provided in section 44-156, below. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-156. - User fees. 
(a)  Each significant industrial user for which the city has reporting requirements under the applicable TPDES permit issued for the operation of the POTW shall, if the environmental officer so demands, compensate NTMWD and/or the city, as appropriate, for the cost of sampling, laboratory analyses and administration required to monitor wastewater discharges. The environmental officer shall determine the number of samples and frequency of sampling necessary to maintain surveillance of discharges. 
(b)  Each industrial user for which the environmental officer takes samples and/or runs laboratory analyses to monitor wastewater discharges shall compensate NTMWD and/or the city, as appropriate, if the environmental officer so demands, for the cost of such sampling and laboratory analyses. 
(c)  NTMWD and/or the city may adopt other reasonable fees for reimbursement of its costs of setting up and operating the pretreatment program which may include: 
(1)  Fees for industrial user wastewater discharge permit applications, including the cost of processing such applications; 
(2)  Other fees to recoup costs of monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures, including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by industrial users; 
(3)  Fees to recoup the costs of responding to discharges by Users in violation of this division and/or to recoup monetary fines and/or penalties imposed on the city for violations of the applicable TPDES permit issued for the operation of the POTW attributable to pass through or interference caused by an industrial user; 
(4)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(5)  Fees for reviewing appeals; and

(d)  All fees required under this division shall be invoiced, upon the environmental officer's request, to the contributing industry or commercial firm by NTMWD and/or the city and shall be payable as indicated on the invoice. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-157. - Industrial wastewater surcharge. 
(a)  A surcharge may be applied in addition to the monthly sewer service charge for the discharge of wastewater with concentrations of either BOD or TSS concentrations exceeding that of "normal domestic sewage," to cover the additional costs of treating such wastewater. Such a charge is collected by the city. 
(b)  The surcharge shall be calculated as follows: 
C = [B(Bu-250) + S (Su-250)] × F × V 
Where: 
C = surcharge to the user in dollars 
B = unit cost factor for treating one unit of BOD (per 1,000 gallons) 
Bu = the tested BOD of the discharge 
S = unit cost factor for treating one unit of TSS (per 1,000 gallons) 
Su = the tested TSS of the discharge 
F = a factor of 8.34 to convert mg/L to pounds/ gallon 
V = monthly billing volume (discharge) in thousand gallons 
250 = average domestic BOD and TSS (250 mg/L) 
(c)  If the concentration of BOD or TSS in the discharge is less than the normal strength for that category above specified, there shall be no surcharge for that category, nor shall there be credit given to the total surcharge if the concentration of either BOD or TSS is less than the normal concentration. 
(d)  All BOD and TSS values used in determining the surcharge shall be re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect any changes in wastewater characteristics as sampling results indicate necessary. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-158. - Inspection and sampling. 
(a)  The environmental officer, as well as other authorized representatives of the city, EPA, TCEQ, and the Texas Department of Health, or any successor agencies bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter the premises of any industrial user at any reasonable time for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, examination and copying of records, sampling and testing of any wastewater discharged into the POTW, as well as of any wastewater prior to treatment or discharge, and inspection of any pretreatment facilities. 
(b)  The environmental officer shall carry out all inspection and monitoring procedures necessary to determine compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(c)  The environmental officer shall have the right to set up on the industrial user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the industrial user's operations. 
(d)  The environmental officer may require the industrial user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The user's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the industrial user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(e)  Anyone acting under this authority shall observe the established rules and regulations concerning safety, internal security, and fire protection. 
(f)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the environmental officer and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
(g)  Any denial of access or unreasonable delay in allowing the environmental officer access to a user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
(h)  Search warrants. If the environmental officer has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this division or any industrial user wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the environmental officer may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-159. - Control manhole. 
(a)  When necessary to monitor wastewater discharged into the POTW, the environmental officer may require an industrial user to provide and install, at its own expense, a suitable control manhole in an easily accessible location on the premises from which the waste is discharged in order to adequately sample and measure such wastewater. Installation of meters, equipment and accessories as deemed necessary by the environmental officer may also be required. 
(b)  A required control manhole shall be: 
(1)  Near the outlet of each building lateral, sewer, drain, pipe, or channel, which connects with the wastewater system; 
(2)  Designed and constructed to prevent infiltration by ground or surface water; 
(3)  Located to provide ample room in or near the facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analyses; and 
(4)  Maintained by the user at all times in safe and proper operating condition. 
(c)  Before beginning construction of a control manhole, the user shall submit plans to the environmental officer for review and approval to ensure compliance with this section. Plans must include any meters or other equipment required to be installed. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-160. - Pretreatment required. 
(a)  Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with all pretreatment standards and requirements, including categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in sections 44-137 and 44-138 of this division, with the time limitations specified by EPA, TCEQ, or the environmental officer, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. The environmental officer may require the development of a compliance schedule by each industrial user for the installation of technology required to meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(b)  Before beginning construction of pretreatment facilities, the user shall submit detailed plans and operating procedures for the facility to the environmental officer for review and approval. The review and approval of such plans and procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the environmental officer and city under the provisions of this division. 
(c)  All industrial users shall promptly notify the environmental officer in advance of any change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p). The environmental officer may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of an industrial user wastewater discharge permit application form. 
(d)  All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards and requirements shall be made available to the environmental officer and to other authorized officials of the City, TCEQ, or EPA upon request. 
(e)  The determination of the character and concentration of industrial wastewater shall be made by the environmental officer at such times and on such schedules as he/she may establish. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-161. - Notice of significant noncompliance. 
(a)  The environmental officer shall publish annually a list of industrial users in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards or other pretreatment requirements during the previous 12 months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the users during the same period. Said list shall be published in the largest daily newspaper published in the city. 
(b)  For purpose of this section, an industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation(s) meets one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH). 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or longer-term average) that the control authority (i.e., the environmental officer) determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public); 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation or group of violations which the control authority (i.e., the environmental officer) determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-162. - Bypass. 
(a)  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c), below. 
(b)  Notice. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the environmental officer, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass to the environmental officer within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The environmental officer may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(c)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the environmental officer may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph (b) of this section. 
(2)  The environmental officer may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the environmental officer determines that it will meet the three conditions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-163. - Slug control plan. 
    Each industrial user shall provide protection from slug discharges, as defined in section 44-133. The environmental officer may require the industrial user to develop and implement a accidental discharge/slug control plan. The plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying NMTWD and the city of accidental or slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 C.F.R. § 403.5, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days;

(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-164. - Notice of potential problems, including slug loading. 
(a)  All categorical and noncategorical industrial users shall immediately notify the environmental officer of all discharges, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or slug loadings as defined in 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(b), that could cause problems to the POTW by the industrial user. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective taken by the user. 
(b)  Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the environmental officer, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(Ord. No. 03-48, § A, 12-1-2003) 
Sec. 44-165. - Affirmative defense. 
(a)  If a person can establish that an event, which would otherwise be a violation of this division, an industrial user wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant to this division, or other federal, state, or local law, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation. 
(b)  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of affirmative defense. An industrial user who wishes to establish an affirmative defense shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operation logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  The event that resulted in a violation occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the violation as being solely an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the environmental officer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation (if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days);

Sec. 44-166. - Notification of discharge of hazardous wastes. 
(a)  If the permittee knows in advance of the need to discharge of a hazardous waste, the permittee shall submit prior written notice, at least ten days before the date of the discharge of a hazardous waste, to NTMWD and the city. If the permittee does not know in advance of the discharge of a hazardous waste, the permittee shall immediately notify NTMWD and the city and submit a written notice to NTMWD within five days of the discharge. The notification shall identify the hazardous waste discharged and the amount of the hazardous waste discharged. 
(b)  In addition to the reporting requirements set out in (a) above, industrial users shall notify the environmental officer, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. Industrial users shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b), (d) and (e). 
(c)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. § 261.30(d) and § 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. 
Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional information. 
(d)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the environmental officer, the EPA regional waste management division director and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(e)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that is has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the extent determined to be economically practical. 
(f)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, an industrial user wastewater discharge permit issued thereunder, or any applicable state or federal law.

(b)  The use of a backflow prevention assembly at the service connection shall be considered as additional backflow protection and shall not negate the use of backflow protection on internal hazards as outlined and enforced by local plumbing codes. 
(c)  At any residence or establishment where there is no actual or potential contamination hazard, a backflow prevention assembly is not required. 
(Ord. No. 07-48, § 2(exh. A(290.44)), 11-19-2007) 
Sec. 44-312. - Minimum acceptable operating practices for public drinking water systems. 
(a)  Section 290.46(i) Plumbing ordinance. Public water systems must adopt an adequate plumbing ordinance, regulations, or service agreement with provisions for proper enforcement to insure that neither cross-connections nor other unacceptable plumbing practices are permitted. See section 290.47(b) of this title (relating to Appendices). Should sanitary control of the distribution system not reside with the purveyor, the entity retaining sanitary control shall be responsible for establishing and enforcing adequate regulations in this regard. The use of pipes and pipe fittings that contain more than 8.0 percent lead or solders and flux that contain more than 0.2 percent lead is prohibited for installation or repair of any public water supply and for installation or repair of any plumbing in a residential or nonresidential facility providing water for human consumption and connected to a public drinking water supply system. This requirement may be waived for lead joints that are necessary for repairs to cast iron pipe. 
(b)  Section 290.46(j) Customer service inspections. A customer service inspection certificate shall be completed prior to providing continuous water service to new construction, on any existing service either when the water purveyor has reason to believe that cross-connections or other potential contamination hazards exist, or after any material improvement, correction, or addition to the private water distribution facilities. Any customer service inspection certificate form which varies from the format found in section 290.47(d) of this title (relating to Customer Service Inspection Certificate) must be approved by the executive director prior to being placed in use. 
(c)  Persons authorized to conduct inspection. Individuals with the following credentials shall be recognized as capable of conducting a customer service inspection certification: 
(1)  Plumbing inspectors and water supply protection specialists licensed by the state board of plumbing examiners. 
(2)  Customer service inspectors who have completed a commission-approved course, passed an examination administered by the executive director, and hold current professional certification or endorsement as a customer service inspector. 
(d)  Discovery and elimination of health hazard. As potential contaminant hazards are discovered, they shall be promptly eliminated to prevent possible contamination of the water supplied by the public water system. The existence of a health hazard, as identified in section 44-313, shall be considered sufficient grounds for immediate termination of water service. Service can be restored only when the health hazard no longer exists, or until the health hazard has been isolated from the public water system in accordance with section 44-311(1) (relating to Water Distribution). 
(e)  Customer service inspection. These customer service inspection requirements are not considered acceptable substitutes for and shall not apply to the sanitary control requirements stated in 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 290.102(a)(5) (relating to Definitions). 
(f)  Examination of private water distribution facilities; restrictions. A customer service inspection is an examination of the private water distribution facilities for the purpose of providing or denying water service. This inspection is limited to the identification and prevention of cross connections, potential contaminant hazards, and illegal lead materials. The customer service inspector has no authority or obligation beyond the scope of the commission's regulations. A customer service inspection is not a plumbing inspection as defined and regulated by the state board of plumbing examiners (TSBPE). A customer service inspector is not permitted to perform plumbing inspections. State statutes and state board of plumbing examiners (TSBPE) adopted rules require that state board of plumbing examiners (TSBPE) licensed plumbing inspectors perform plumbing inspections of all new plumbing and alterations or additions to existing plumbing within the municipal limits of all cities, towns, and villages which have passed an ordinance adopting one of the plumbing codes recognized by state board of plumbing examiners (TSBPE). Such entities may stipulate that the customer service inspection be performed by the plumbing inspector as a part of the more comprehensive plumbing inspection. Where such entities permit customer service inspectors to perform customer service inspections, the customer service inspector shall report any violations immediately to the local entity's plumbing inspection department.

(e)  All erosion and sediment control measures and other identified best management practices shall be observed in order to ensure that they are operating correctly and are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters of the state and the MS4. Based on the results of these inspections, best management practices shall be modified as appropriate, and as soon as is practicable. 
(f)  The director may require plans and/or specifications that are prepared for the construction of site improvements to illustrate and describe the best management practices required in this section that will be implemented on the construction site by means of an erosion control plan and/or storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). 
(g)  The director may deny approval of any permit or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to receive a certificate of occupancy, on the grounds that the management practices described in the erosion control plans, storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), or observed upon a site inspection by the director are determined not to control and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with clearing, grading, excavation, or other construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. 
(h)  Any owner of a site of construction activity, whether or not such owner is an operator, is jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the requirements in this section. 
(i)  Any contractor or subcontractor on a site of construction activity, who is not an owner or operator, but who is responsible under such person's contract or subcontract for implementing a best management practices control measure, is jointly and severally responsible for any willful or negligent failure on such person's part to adequately implement that control measure. 
(j)  Whenever the management practices at a construction site are modified (as a result of change in the construction project, in order to implement more effective management practices, in response to an order or request from the director, or for any other reason), a written description of such modifications of the management practices may be requested by the director. If requested, the new management plan must be submitted as soon as possible, but in no case later than seven calendar days following the request.

Sec. 44-456. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition. 
(2)  Storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants. 
(3)  Storm water runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of storm water runoff from development sites. 
(b)  The city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters in the city to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. 
(c)  It is determined that the regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety. 
(Ord. No. 18-15, § 1, 3-5-2018) 
Sec. 44-457. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to establish minimum storm water management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within the city. This division seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  To minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development or redevelopment in order to reduce flooding, siltation and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels; 
(2)  To minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development or redevelopment to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic conditions to the maximum extent practicable; 
(3)  To accommodate new development and redevelopment projects in a manner that protects public safety, groundwater and surface water quality and aquatic living resources and their habitats; 
(4)  To employ permanent nonstructural and structural best management practices (BMPs) to protect water quality thereby raising public awareness to storm water quality related issues; 
(5)  To remove and/or treat storm water pollutants prior to discharge to ground and surface waters throughout the city; 
(6)  To ensure the long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent storm water quality features; and 
(7)  To reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, to the waters of the state through storm water management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to the public.

Article I - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
SECTION 1. - SHORT TITLE 
    This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the Unified Development Code of the City of Rockwall, or simply as the Unified Development Code or UDC. 
SECTION 2. - AUTHORITY 
    The Unified Development Code is adopted pursuant to the powers granted to the city and subject to any limitations imposed by the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas. 
SECTION 3. - JURISDICTION 
    The provisions of this Unified Development Code apply generally to all property within the corporate limits of the City of Rockwall and to the lands subject to its zoning jurisdiction as conferred by state law. Those provisions pertaining to the subdivision of land, and those regulations adopted for the primary purpose of protecting water quality or to afford flood protection, apply to all property within the [city's] corporate boundaries and to all property within its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), as established by Texas Local Government Code chapter 42 and chapter 212. References to jurisdictions or the applicability of specific development regulations appearing elsewhere in this Unified Development Code take precedence over this jurisdictional statement in the event of a conflicting interpretation. 
SECTION 4. - PURPOSES 
    The Unified Development Code is adopted for the following purposes: 
  To protect, promote, improve and provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Rockwall; 
  To ensure the safe, orderly and efficient development and expansion of the City of Rockwall in accordance with and pursuant to its comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan, and open space plan; 
  To conserve, develop, protect and utilize natural resources, including, but not limited to, topography, vegetation, flood plain and other resources, in keeping with the public interest; 
  To prevent the overcrowding of land and avoid undue concentration or diffusion of population or land uses; 
  To protect and preserve places and areas of historical, cultural or architectural importance and significance to the community; 
  To protect and conserve the value of land throughout the city and the value of buildings and improvements upon the land, and to minimize the conflicts among the uses of land and buildings; 
  To provide for open spaces through the most efficient design and layout of the land; 
  To prevent the pollution of air and water, to ensure the adequacy of drainage facilities, to safeguard water resources and to preserve the integrity and aesthetic quality of the community; 
  To lessen congestion in the streets and provide convenient, safe and efficient circulation for vehicular and pedestrian traffic; 
  To facilitate the adequate and efficient provision of transportation, water, wastewater, schools, parks, public safety and recreational facilities, and other public facilities and services; and 
  To treat in one unified text those areas of regulation more typically dealt with in separate ordinances such as, but not exclusively, the zoning ordinance[s], the subdivision rules and regulations. 
SECTION 5. - EFFECTIVE DATE AND APPLICABILITY 
    The Unified Development Code takes effect upon adoption of the ordinance [from which this Unified Development Code is derived] by the city council. The provisions of this [Unified Development] Code supersede all other development regulations governing the development of land within the city. All development applications and proposals filed on or after the effective date of the ordinance [from which this Unified Development Code is derived], whether for new developments or for add-ons or expansions of existing developments, shall be processed in accordance with the standards and requirements and pursuant to the procedures herein established. 
SECTION 6. - APPLICABILITY OF EXISTING REGULATIONS 
    All existing unexpired, valid building permits which are complete and duly filed prior to enactment of the Unified Development Code in accordance with development regulations in effect prior to adoption of these regulations, shall be processed under procedures therein established, and shall be evaluated and approved or disapproved under the standards and requirements contained in such regulations, notwithstanding the adoption of the Unified Development Code. Those site plans which were technically reviewed and approved by the city council prior to the adoption of this [Unified Development] Code shall be exempt from meeting any new requirements after the adoption of this [Unified Development] Code. 
SECTION 7. - RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN, THOROUGHFARE PLAN AND OPEN SPACE PLAN 
    The Unified Development Code is intended to implement the policies and objectives contained in the comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan, and open space plan for the city and to affect the city's plan for provision of public facilities and services within town limits and within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. If a zoning or rezoning request differs from what the comprehensive plan, thoroughfare plan, or open space plan recommends for that area, the city planner will advise applicant of this and will request applicant to submit a written letter. This letter will request the city planner to prepare and process the necessary exception or amendment to the plan. The city will process this request concurrently with the (re)zoning case at no additional cost to the applicant. 
SECTION 8. - COMPLIANCE WITH CODE REQUIRED 
    All development of land within the incorporated boundaries of the City of Rockwall or its extraterritorial jurisdiction as applicable, shall conform to the requirements of the Unified Development Code, and no person may use, occupy, sell or develop land, buildings or other structures, or authorize or permit the use, occupancy, sale or development of land, buildings or other structures under his control, except in accordance with all applicable provisions of this [Unified Development] Code.

In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed unless there is a restraining order granted by the board or by a court of competent jurisdiction on application, and notice is given to the officer whose decision is the subject of appeal. 
B.  Odd shaped parcels. Permit such modifications of the height, yard, area, coverage and parking regulations as may be necessary to secure appropriate development of a parcel of land which differs from other parcels in the district by being of such restricted area, shape, or slope that it cannot be appropriately developed without such modification. 
C.  Nonconforming use. Permit the expansion or enlargement of a building occupied by a nonconforming use on the lot or tract occupied by such building, provided such reconstruction does not prevent the return of such property to a conforming use.

D.  Change of nonconforming use. To authorize a change of use from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use, provided that such change is to a use of the same or more restricted classification.

The board may establish a specific period of time for the conversion of the occupancy to a conforming use. 
E.  Discontinuance of a nonconforming use.

F.  Structure for a legal nonconforming use. Permit the construction, reconstruction, enlargement or addition of a structure occupied by or for a use, normally ancillary to a single-family residential use, when such single-family residential use or structure, is legally nonconforming; provided, however, such construction, reconstruction, enlargement or addition does not prevent the return of such property to a conforming use. 
G.  Nonconforming structure. To authorize the reconstruction and occupancy of a nonconforming structure, or a structure containing a nonconforming use, where such structure has been damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of more than 50 percent, but less than the total, of the replacement cost of the structure on the date of the damage. Such action by the board of adjustment shall have due regard for the property rights of the person or person affected, and shall be considered in regard to the public welfare, character of the area surrounding such structure, and the conservation, preservation and protection of property.

In such instance, the current value shall be established at the time of application for a hearing before the board. If such expansion or enlargement is approved by the board, all provisions of the district in which such structure is located shall apply to the new construction on the lot or parcel. 
I.  Occupation of an abandoned nonconforming structure. To authorize the occupancy of an abandoned nonconforming structure. Such action by the board shall have due regard for the property rights of the person or persons affected, and shall be considered in regard to the public welfare and safety, character or the area surrounding such structure, and the conservation, preservation and protection of property.

SECTION 4. - SPECIFIC USE PERMITS 

Sec. 4.1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of a Specific Use Permit (SUP) is to allow discretionary consideration of certain uses that would typically be considered incompatible within certain locations of a zoning district, but may become compatible with the addition of special provisions, conditions or restrictions. A SUP does not change the base zoning; it allows a particular use that would not normally be permitted in that zoning district. The SUP requirement for any land use is identified in the Permitted Land Use table contained in Article IV, Permissible Uses, of this Unified Development Code. The discretionary SUP procedure is designed to enable the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council to impose conditions upon such uses and structures that are designed to avoid, minimize or mitigate potentially adverse effects upon the community or other properties in the vicinity of the proposed use or structure, and to deny requests for a SUP when it is apparent that a proposed use or structure will or may occasionally harm the community or cause injury to the value, lawful use, and reasonable enjoyment of other properties in the vicinity of the proposed use or structure.

Sec. 5.2. - Dumping, excavating or filling floodplain. 
    Any dump, excavation, storage or filling operation within that portion of a district having a floodplain designation shall require a permit, which must be approved by the city council, before such operation is begun. However, if those operations in the floodplain were specifically approved as part of a site plan approval by the city council, then a permit may be issued by the city engineer. 
Sec. 5.3. - Local flooding may occur in other areas. 
    The fact that land or property is or is not within a district having a floodplain designation shall not constitute assurance that such land or property is not subject to local flooding and the designation of floodplain in this [Unified Development Code] shall not be so interpreted.

    When considering requests for a new land use, the commission and council shall consider the potential effects of the use on adjacent properties in terms of requirements for services, visual impact, traffic generation, the extent to which the use is consistent with other uses allowed in the district, and other issues they deem appropriate. 
SECTION 8. - NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND SITES 

Sec. 8.1. - Intent. 
    Within the zoning districts established by this [Unified Development Code], there may exist lots, structures and uses of land which were lawful before the effective date of the ordinance from which this Unified Development Code is derived, or amendment thereto, and which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under this [Unified Development Code]. It is generally the intent to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed or abandoned, or until such earlier time as they are ordered to be removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent that such nonconforming lots, buildings, or uses shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, except as otherwise specifically provided, and that such nonconforming lots, buildings or uses may not be used as justification for adding other lots, buildings or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zoning district. Except as otherwise provided, nonconforming uses are declared to be incompatible with permitted uses in the same zoning districts. 
Sec. 8.2. - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this section shall apply to lots, uses and buildings which become nonconforming by reason of the adoption of, or an amendment to, the ordinance from which this Unified Development Code is derived, as of the effective date of such amendment. 
Sec. 8.3. - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  Exceptions. 
1.  Except as specified below, any use, building, or structure lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of this [Unified Development Code] or at the time of annexation into the city may be continued, even though the use, building or structure may not conform to the provisions of this [Unified Development Code] for the district in which it is located. 
2.  The right to continue nonconforming uses shall be subject to regulations prohibiting the creation of a nuisance and regulations reasonably protecting adjacent property. 
B.  Cessation of nonconforming use. For the purposes of this subsection, a use shall be deemed to have ceased or been abandoned when it has been discontinued for 180 days during any three-year period whether with the intent to abandon the use or not. 
C.  Expansion of nonconforming use. No existing building or premises devoted to a use that is not permitted by this [Unified Development Code] in the district in which such building or premises is located shall be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, except when required to do so by law or order, unless the use is changed to a use that is permitted in the district in which the building or premises is located, and except as follows: 
1.  If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of a more restrictive classification when authorized by the board of adjustment; or it may be changed to a conforming use. 
2.  Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, the use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use. 
3.  When authorized by the board of adjustment, enlargement or completion of a building devoted to a nonconforming use may be made upon the lot occupied by the building, where the extension is necessary and incidental to the existing use of the building and does not exceed 25 percent of its original area of nonconformity. 
4.  When authorized by the board of adjustment, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout those parts of a building which were manifestly designed or arranged for such use prior to the date on which the use of the building became nonconforming, if no structural alterations except those required by law, are made. 
Sec. 8.4. - Nonconforming building or sites. 
A.  City-created nonconformity of structures. In the event that the city takes an act or action which transforms a previously conforming structure for purposes of front, side and rear yard setback requirements into a nonconforming structure for the purposes of front, side and rear yard setbacks, then such structure shall be deemed to be in conformance with the required setback prescribed in this [Unified Development Code]. (For land use nonconformity, see article IV, Permissible Uses, section 7.) 
B.  Use of nonconforming buildings, structures or land. 
1.  No building or structure which was originally designed for or used as a nonconforming use shall again be put to a nonconforming use, where such use has ceased for 180 days or more during any three-year period. 
2.  The use of land, structures, and/or buildings involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or less, which does not conform to the provisions of this [Unified Development Code] shall be discontinued within six months from the enactment of this [Unified Development Code]. The nonconforming use of land and/or buildings involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or less, which becomes nonconforming by reason of subsequent amendments to this [Unified Development Code] shall be discontinued within six months from the date of such amendment. 
C.  Construction approved prior to [Unified Development Code]. Nothing in this [Unified Development Code] shall be construed to require any change in the overall plans, construction, or designated use of any development, structure, or part thereof, where official approval and the required building permits were granted before the enactment of this [Unified Development Code], or any amendment thereto, where construction, conforming with the plans, shall have been started prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this Unified Development Code is derived or such amendment, and where such construction shall have been completed in a normal manner within the subsequent 12-month period, with no interruption, except for reasons beyond the builder's control. 
D.  Damage due to acts of God. Any nonconforming structure which is damaged more than 75 percent of its then appraised tax value above the foundation, by fire, flood, explosion, wind, earthquake, war, riot or other calamity or act of God, shall not be restored or reconstructed and used as it was before the damaging event. If such structure is damaged less than 75 percent of its then appraised tax value above the foundation, it may be restored, reconstructed, or used as before, provided that the restoration or reconstruction is completed within 12 months of the damaging event. The 12-month period does not include any necessary litigation. 
E.  Repair of unsafe buildings, structures and sites. Nothing in this [Unified Development Code] shall be construed to prohibit the strengthening or repair of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe by proper authority, unless such repairs exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost of the building. If the repairs exceed 50 percent, the building shall be brought into conformity with all requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. 
F.  General repairs and maintenance. 
1.  On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, no work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-load-bearing walls, fixture, wiring, or plumbing to an extent exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be. 
2.  If 50 percent or more of a nonconforming structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs or maintenance, and is declared by a duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
G.  Moving of a nonconforming building or structure. No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to any other location on the lot, or on any other lot, unless every portion of the building or structure is made to conform to all the regulations of the district. 
H.  Nonconforming lot sizes. All lots used for storage that do not require a building and the use of such lot is made nonconforming by this [Unified Development Code] or amendments thereto shall cease to be used for such storage within six months of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this Unified Development Code is derived, or amendments [thereto].

No fence, wall screen, billboard, sign face, tree or shrub foliage, berm, or any other item, either manmade or natural, shall be erected, planted, or maintained in such a position or place so as to obstruct or interfere within the following minimum standards; however, on non-residentially zoned lots, a single pole for mounting a sign may be placed within this area provided the pole does not exceed 12-inches in diameter, and provided every portion of the sign has a minimum height clearance of nine (9) feet: 
1.  Visibility Triangles. Vision at all intersections which intersect at or near right angles shall be clear at elevations between 24-inches and nine (9) feet above the top of the curb elevation, within a triangular area formed by extending the two (2) curblines from their point of intersection, for the following minimum distances for the applicable intersection, and connecting these points with an imaginary line, thereby making a triangle. If there are no curbs existing, the triangular area shall be formed by extending the property lines from their point of intersection for a distance as prescribed below, and connecting these points with an imaginary line, thereby making a triangle as shown below. 
2.  Intersection of two (2) public streets. The minimum required distance from the curb shall be 30-feet and the minimum distance from the property line on streets without a curb shall be 20-feet. 
3.  Intersection of a public street and an alley. The minimum required distance measured from the property line shall be 15-feet, or 25-feet from street curb. 
4.  Intersection of private drive and public street. The minimum required distance from the curb shall be 15-feet and the minimum distance from the property line on streets without a curb shall be ten (10) feet. 
C.  Sight distance requirements. The city hereby adopts the standards for both vertical and horizontal sight distance requirements set forth in the latest edition of AASHTO green book "a policy on geometric design of highways and streets" for the construction of both public street intersections and private drive intersections, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. If, in the opinion of the city engineer, a proposed street or drive intersection does not meet these standards, additional engineering information exhibiting how the standards have been addressed may be required for submission and approval by the city's engineer.

(a)  Primary Materials. Primary Materials shall include stone, brick, and cementitious materials. Specific requirements for Primary Materials are as follows: 
A.  Cementitious Materials. The use of cementitious materials (e.g. stucco, cementitious lap siding, or similar materials approved by the Director of Planning or his/her designee) shall be limited to 60% of the building's exterior façade. 
B.  Chimneys. All new homes shall be required to incorporate a masonry chimney (i.e. brick and stone only). 
(b)  Secondary Materials. Secondary Materials are any material that is not deemed to be a Primary Material as defined above. 
(2)  Exceptions. Exceptions to the material requirements, including exceptions for buildings for farm animals, may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Planning and Zoning Commission upon submission and approval of material samples and building elevations of the structure. If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies an exception request, the applicant may appeal the decision to the City Council by filing a written request to the Planning and Zoning Department. The request should provide justification for the exception being requested (i.e. detail the unique or extraordinary conditions that exist and/or the undue hardship created by strict adherence to the technical requirements). 
B.  Accessory Structures. 
1.  Accessory Structure Standards. All accessory structures shall conform to the related standards listed within Section 7.04 , Accessory Structure Development Standards. 
C.  Open Space. On all new subdivisions, ten (10) lots or greater, that are not infill projects (i.e. projects going into an established area as determined by the Director of Planning and Zoning or his/her designee) the following open space requirements shall be applied: 
a.  Unless otherwise provided by this Unified Development Code, a minimum of 20% of the gross land area within a residential subdivision that is five (5) acres or greater shall be devoted to open space. Where floodplain exists in a proposed subdivision, the floodplain may be used to meet the 20% requirement at a rate of 1/2-acre for every one (1) acre of floodplain dedicated to open space. Open space requirements for subdivisions may be satisfied by public open space/parkland, or by a combination of public and private open space. Public open space/parkland shall be dedicated to the city, and shall be approved by the Parks and Recreation Board and the City Council during the platting process. Open space requirements specified in this subsection are in addition to requirements for site landscaping and buffering. 
b.  To encourage the provision of open space, the minimum lot sizes in a residential subdivision may be reduced by up to 20% in order to preserve additional public and/or private open space, provided that the lots being reduced face onto a single loaded street (i.e. a street with open space and/or a public park on one side of the street and lots on the other side of the street). This requirement shall be approved by the City Council at the time of preliminary plat, final plat, or site plan whichever comes first. 
D.  Anti-Monotony. The front elevation of a home shall not repeat along any block face without at least four (4) intervening homes of differing appearance on the same side of the street and two (2) intervening homes of differing appearance on the opposite side of the street. The rear elevation of homes backing to open spaces or thoroughfares shall not repeat without at least two (2) intervening homes of differing appearance. Identical brick blends may not occur on adjacent (side-by-side) properties. Homes are considered to differ in appearance if any two (2) of the following elements are different:

b.  Tubular steel or wrought-iron type fencing shall be allowed. 
c.  Tubular steel or wrought-iron type fencing shall be required on all lots located adjacent to perimeter roadways, open spaces, greenbelts and/or parks. 
d.  Split rail fencing shall be allowed on lots containing 20,000 SF or more. 
e.  Fencing on corner lots constructed adjacent to the street shall provide masonry columns at 45-feet off-center spacing that begins at the rear property line corner and terminates at least 15-feet behind the front yard building setback line. A maximum six (6) foot tall, solid board-on-board, panel cedar fencing or wrought-iron type fencing shall be allowed between the masonry columns along the side and/or rear yard adjacent to a street. 
1.  On corner lots that have rear lot lines adjacent to alleyways or other rear lot lines, fences may be constructed along the side yard adjacent to the street, subject to a minimum five (5) foot setback from the right-of-way. The property owner shall maintain that portion of the property outside of the fence. 
2.  On corner lots that have rear lot lines adjacent to a side lot line of an adjoining lot(s), only tubular steel or wrought-iron type fences not exceeding 42-inches in height may be constructed beyond the building line. Fences constructed on or behind the building line shall comply with the material requirements detailed above. 
f.  All common areas and perimeter fencing shall be maintained by a Homeowners Association (HOA) as specified in the City's subdivision regulations.

(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
SECTION 4: - COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS 

Subsection 4.01: - General Commercial District Standards 
    All commercial development shall conform to the following standards: 
A.  Construction Materials. 
1.  Materials and Masonry Composition. Each exterior wall of a building's façade shall consist of a minimum of 90% Primary Materials and/or a maximum of 10% Secondary Materials, excluding doors and windows, as defined below. 
a.  Primary Materials. Primary Materials shall include stone, brick, glass curtain wall, glass block, tile, and custom Concrete Masonry Units (CMU) (i.e. CMUs that have been sandblasted, burnished or that have a split face-light weight block or smooth faced CMU shall be prohibited). Specific requirements for Primary Materials are as follows: 
1.  Stone. A minimum of 20% stone (i.e. natural or synthetic/cultured ) is required on all building façades. 
2.  Cementitious Materials. The use of cementitious materials (e.g. stucco, cementitious lap siding, or similar materials approved by the Director of Planning or his/her designee) shall be limited to 50% of the building's exterior façade. However, stucco shall not be used within the first four (4) feet from grade on a building's façade. 
3.  Accent Brick and Stone. Each building shall incorporate accent brick or stone, or brick and stone patterns and materials that create contrast through color, shape, size, and/or texture to the planes of the primary brick or stone materials used on each building elevation. 
b.  Secondary Materials. Secondary Materials are any material that is not deemed to be a Primary Material as defined above. This includes materials like aluminum composite materials, metal panels, acrylic products (i.e. EIFS products), cast stone, or other materials identified by the Director of Planning and Zoning or his/her designee. 
2.  Exceptions. Exceptions to the material requirements may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Planning and Zoning Commission upon recommendation from the Architectural Review Board (ARB). The submission and approval of material samples and building elevations of the structure shall be required. If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies an exception request, the applicant may appeal the decision to the City Council by filing a written request to the Planning and Zoning Department. The request should provide justification for the exception being requested (i.e. detail the unique or extraordinary conditions that exist and/or the undue hardship created by strict adherence to the technical requirements). 
B.  Maximum Building Height. 
1.  Setback Exceptions for Building Height in Commercial Districts. All structures shall conform to the height requirements specified for the zoning district of the subject property as stipulated by Section 7.03 , Non-Residential District Development Standards; however, the following features may be constructed 12-feet higher than the maximum height requirement if they [1] are not more than 33% of the total roof area, and [2] are setback from the edge of the roof a minimum of two (2) feet for every one (1) foot that the feature extends above the surface of the roof: 
a.  Chimneys, Church Spires, Elevator Shafts, and similar appendages not intended as places of occupancy and/or storage. 
b.  Flag Poles. 
c.  Solar Collectors and/or Similar Equipment, Fixtures, and Devices. 
C.  Building Articulation. 
1.  Primary Building Façades. A primary building façade is any building façade that has a primary entryway for a business or that has an adjacency to a public right-of-way, open space/green space, public/private park, and/or a residential zoning district or residentially used property. All commercial buildings shall meet the following standards for articulation on primary building façades: 

:  Wall Height. The wall height shall be measured from grade to the top of the wall. 
:  Wall Length. The maximum wall length shall not exceed three (3) times the wall height (i.e. 3 × = ). 
: Secondary Entryway/Architectural Element Length. The minimum length of the secondary entryway or projecting architectural element shall be 25% of the wall length (i.e. 25% × = ). 
: Wall Projection. The minimum wall projection for a primary and/or secondary entryway/architectural element shall be 25% of the wall height (i.e. 25% × = ). 
: Primary and/or Secondary Entryway/Architectural Element Width. The minimum width of the primary and/or secondary entryway/architectural element shall extend for twice the required wall projection (i.e. 2 × = ). 
: Projection Height. The primary and secondary entryways/architectural element shall extend a minimum of 25% of the wall height above the top of the wall (i.e. 25% × = ). 
: Primary Entryway/Architectural Element Length. The primary entryway/architectural element shall meet all of the same projections as the secondary entryway/architectural element, but shall extend for a minimum of twice the length of the secondary element (i.e. 2 × = ). 
2.  Secondary Building Façade. A secondary building façade is any building façade that does not have a primary entryway or an adjacency to a public right-of-way, open space/green space, public/private park, and/or a residential zoning district or residentially used property. All commercial buildings shall meet the following standards for articulation on secondary building façades: 

: Wall Height. The wall height shall be measured from grade to the top of the wall. 
: Wall Length. The maximum wall length shall not exceed three (3) times the wall height (i.e. 3 × = ). 
: Secondary Entryway/Architectural Element Length. The minimum length of the secondary entryway or projecting architectural element shall be 15% of the wall length (i.e. 15% × = ). 
: Secondary Entryway/Architectural Element Width. The minimum wall projection for a secondary entryway/architectural element shall be 15% of the wall height (i.e. 15% × = ). 
: Projection Height. The secondary entryway/architectural element shall extend a minimum of 15% of the wall height above the top of the wall (i.e. 15% × = ). 
3.  Exceptions. Exceptions to the building articulation requirements may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Planning and Zoning Commission pending a recommendation from the Architectural Review Board (ARB). In determining if an exception to the building articulation requirements is appropriate the Planning and Zoning Commission should determine if the proposed request is (1) in conformance with the spirit and intent of the building articulation requirements, and (2) if granting the exception will substantially weaken the City's ability to enforce the general purpose of the building articulation requirements in the future. If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies an exception request, the applicant may appeal the decision to the City Council by filing a written request to the Planning and Zoning Department. The request should provide justification for the exception being requested (i.e. detail the unique or extraordinary conditions that exist and/or the undue hardship created by strict adherence to the technical requirements). 
D.  Open Space Guidelines. Commercial land uses should be designed to be integrated with adjacent land uses, as opposed to separating land uses using physical barriers or screening walls (unless necessary). This should be achieved by making commercial developments pedestrian-oriented and easily accessible to adjacent developments through the use of natural buffers, open space and trails. This involves creating trails that connect commercial and residential developments, using landscape buffers that incorporate berms and landscaping to separate residential and non-residential land uses, and utilizing building design to create compatibility with surrounding land uses. 
E.  Commercial Buildings 25,000 SF or Greater. 
1.  Applicability. These criteria shall apply to new retail/commercial building construction in all commercial zoning districts. This criteria shall not be applied to the use, re-use, modification or consolidation of existing retail and/or commercial space developed on or before April 2, 2001, or to the expansion of retail space in existence on or before April 2, 2001, that is being expanded by less than ten (10%) percent of the existing floor area. 
2.  Exterior Building Materials. The area of all exterior facades shall consist of 90% brick, stone, cast stone, custom Concrete Masonry Units (CMUs) (i.e. CMUs that have been sandblasted, burnished or that have a split face-light weight block or smooth faced CMU shall be prohibited), stucco or a combination of these materials. Each facade shall not contain more than 75% of any single material. 
3.  Loading Docks. Loading docks shall not be oriented towards a residential zoning district or residentially used property. Where loading areas are located parallel to a residential zoning district or residentially used property, they must be screened by an architecturally integrated masonry screening wall that is a minimum 14-foot in height and that runs the entire length of the loading space. As an alternative, the Planning and Zoning Commission may approve the use of a berm in conjunction with landscape screening if it is determined that this screening method will (1) provide a suitable substitute to a masonry wall, and (2) if the screening method will completely screen the proposed loading docks. 
4.  On-Site Circulation Guidelines. 
a.  On-site circulation standards should try to minimize the conflict between pedestrians and vehicles by placing driveways and service areas in locations that reduce the chance of interrupting on-site vehicle movement. 
b.  Buildings should be placed in a manner that screens the drive-through lane and creates pedestrian pathways and spaces. 
c.  In order to maintain on-site circulation, each drive-through lane is to be separate from pump islands and from routes necessary for entering and exiting the property. 
5.  Residential Adjacency Standards. Where the property immediately abuts a residential zoning district or residentially used property-unless separated by an M4D (major collector, four (4) lane, divided roadway) or larger thoroughfare-a minimum ten (10) foot wide landscaped buffer must be installed for buildings with a building footprint of 25,000 SF to 49,999 SF in area, a minimum 15-foot wide landscaped buffer for buildings with a building footprint of 50,000 SF to 79,999 SF in area, and a minimum 30-foot wide landscaped buffer for buildings with a building footprint of 80,000 SF and greater in area. This shall be in addition to the screening required by the landscape regulations of the City of Rockwall for all aforementioned building sizes. The landscaped buffer must include a combination of berms, evergreen shrubs, and a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees (minimum four (4) inch caliper) placed at a minimum 25-feet on center. Planting may be grouped if approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
6.  Outside Storage. Open storage areas shall be connected to the building and screened with a wall that is constructed of the same building materials as the remainder of the primary structure. 
7.  Adaptive Reuse Standards. For those buildings over 80,000 SF in area, the applicant must demonstrate that the building can be subdivided in a reasonable manner by submitting a plan indicating potential entrances and exits and loading areas for multiple tenants. This plan will need to be submitted at the time of site plan.

Subsection 4.02: - Residential-Office (RO) District 
A.  Purpose. The Residential-Office (RO) District is a zoning district intended to recognize the existence of older residential areas of the city, where larger houses have been or can be converted from single-family and multi-family residences to low-intensity office uses in order to extend the economic life of these structures, and to allow the owners to justify the expenditures for repairs and modernization. The intent of this district is to allow for low intensity office development providing professional, medical and other office services and limited retail businesses to residents in adjacent neighborhoods. The Residential-Office (RO) District shall have principle access to major or secondary thoroughfares, and may serve as an area of transition between residential and high-intensity, non-residential uses or busy arterial thoroughfares. 
B.  Permitted Uses. All land uses permitted within the Residential-Office (RO) District are outlined in Section 1, Land Use Schedule, of Article IV, Permissible Uses. 
C.  Area Requirements. All development within a Residential-Office (RO) District shall conform to Section 4.01 , General Commercial District Standards, and the related standards listed within Section 7.03 , Non-Residential District Development Standards. 
(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
Subsection 4.03: - Neighborhood Services (NS) District 
A.  Purpose. The Neighborhood Services (NS) District is a zoning district intended to provide limited retail land uses near neighborhoods for the purpose of supplying the day-to-day retail and personal service needs of residents. The Neighborhood Services (NS) District is typically located at limited corner locations on arterials in existing developments, and is intended to serve small service areas. The average site is from 1/2-acre to a maximum of two (2) acres. Since these sites are typically small and surrounded by residential development they can appear to be spot zones; however, the Comprehensive Plan acknowledges the need to create neighborhood units, which involve the need for limited retail and service uses in close proximity to neighborhoods. These convenience centers should be constructed to a residential scale, and be visually and dimensionally compatible to adjacent residential developments. The Neighborhood Services (NS) District should not contain uses that create excessive amounts of traffic, noise, litter or that would not be conducive to residential adjacency. Due to the residential adjacency of this zoning district, increased landscaping and buffering requirements are necessary. 
B.  Permitted Uses. All land uses permitted within the Neighborhood Services (NS) District are outlined in Section 1, Land Use Schedule, of Article IV, Permissible Uses. 
C.  Area Requirements. All development within a Neighborhood Services (NS) District shall conform to Section 4.01 , General Commercial District Standards, and the related standards listed within Section 7.03 , Non-Residential District Development Standards. 
(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
Subsection 4.04: - General Retail (GR) District 
A.  Purpose. The General Retail (GR) District is a zoning district intended to provide limited retail and service uses for one (1) or more neighborhoods. The land uses specified in this district include most types of retail and office activity, and are typically located on/at the intersections of major thoroughfares. This district does not include strip commercial/retail centers, large shopping centers, wholesaling operations, lumberyards, contractor yards, and/or warehouses with high volumes of commercial truck traffic. The General Retail (GR) District is not a major commercial/retail district, and should try to avoid intensive commercial land uses that carry large volumes of retail traffic. The noise, traffic, litter, late night hours, and other influences that could be harmful to residential areas require adequate buffering and screening from residential areas. Traffic from land uses in this district should not pass through residential areas, except on arterial or major collectors. There are restrictions on access to prevent traffic congestion or an adverse effect on major thoroughfares adjacent to residential areas. Areas should not be zoned General Retail (GR) District unless they are located on or close to an arterial or major collector that is capable of carrying increased traffic. Since the General Retail (GR) District will be located close to residential areas, the development standards are stringent and require high standards of development similar to the Residential-Office (RO) and Neighborhood Services (NS) Districts. 
B.  Permitted Uses. All land uses permitted within the General Retail (GR) District are outlined in Section 1, Land Use Schedule, of Article IV, Permissible Uses. 
C.  Area Requirements. All development within a General Retail (GR) District shall conform to Section 4.01 , General Commercial District Standards, and the related standards listed within Section 7.03 , Non-Residential District Development Standards. 
(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
Subsection 4.05: - Commercial (C) District 
A.  Purpose. The Commercial (C) District is the proper zoning classification for most types of commercial development (e.g. larger shopping centers at major intersections, commercial strips along arterial roadways, etc.). The land uses specified for the Commercial (C) District include most types of office and retail activity with some special provisions for wholesale land uses. This district mostly excludes land uses that are not compatible with retail shopping (e.g. lumberyards, contractor yards, warehousing, or other land uses with high volumes of truck traffic and low volumes of retail traffic). The noise, traffic, litter, late night hours, and other influences that could be harmful to neighborhoods require adequate buffering and mitigating factors when locating adjacent to residential areas. Areas should not be zoned to Commercial (C) District unless they are located on or close to an arterial or major collector that is capable of carrying the additional traffic generated by land uses in this district. In addition, these areas may require increased water, fire protection, wastewater and drainage capacity. The Commercial (C) District is a general business zone, and is intended to service most commercial land uses, with the exception of land uses that would fall into the Heavy Commercial (HC) District. Since the Commercial (C) District is general in nature, the development standards are less stringent and do not require as high of standards of development as the Residential-Office (RO), Neighborhood Services (NS) and General Retail (GR) Districts. 
B.  Permitted Uses. All land uses permitted within the Commercial (C) District are outlined in Section 1, Land Use Schedule, of Article IV, Permissible Uses. 
C.  Area Requirements. All development within a Commercial (C) District shall conform to Section 4.01 , General Commercial District Standards, and the related standards listed within Section 7.03 , Non-Residential District Development Standards. 
D.  Special District Requirements. 
1.  Business Operations and Storage. All business operations including storage shall be conducted within a completely enclosed building unless specifically authorized for the use as stipulated in Section 1, Land Use Schedule, of Article IV, Permissible Uses. This excludes off-street parking and loading, incidental display of retail items for sale, retail outlets where gasoline products are sold and drive-in businesses. 
(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
Subsection 4.06: - Heavy Commercial (HC) District 
A.  Purpose. The Heavy Commercial (HC) District is the proper zoning classification for commercial establishments that may involve uses that would not be suitable in the other commercial zoning districts. Included in this district are commercial uses that involve large volumes of commercial truck traffic, outside operations, outside storage of materials and equipment, excessive noise from heavy service operations, and/or any other possibly adverse operations. The Heavy Commercial (HC) District is commercial in nature, but has some aspects that are similar to industrial land uses. The zoning district allows noise, traffic, litter, late night hours, outside storage of materials and equipment, and other influences that could be harmful if directly adjacent to residential areas, and will require adequate buffering and other mitigating factors if such an adjacency exists. Areas should not be zoned to Heavy Commercial (HC) District unless they are located on or close to an arterial that is capable of carrying large volumes of commercial truck traffic. Businesses locating in the Heavy Commercial (HC) District should work with the City to ensure that water, wastewater, and drainage capacity is adequate before locating on a particular property, and that streets in and adjacent to this district are of a size and strength to accommodate commercial truck traffic. 
B.  Permitted Uses. All land uses permitted within the Heavy Commercial (HC) District are outlined in Section 1, Land Use Schedule, of Article IV, Permissible Uses. 
C.  Area Requirements. All development within a Commercial (C) District shall conform to Section 4.01 , General Commercial District Standards, and the related standards listed within Section 7.03 , Non-Residential District Development Standards. 
D.  Special District Requirements. 
1.  Outside Storage. 
a.  All outside storage shall be placed behind the front facade of the main structure. This does not apply to uses that allow incidental display, in which case only the amount of goods necessary for display purposes shall be exempt from this requirement. 
b.  All outside storage shall be screened from streets and public areas. 
(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
Subsection 4.07: - Downtown (DT) District 
I.  Purpose, goals and intent. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the Downtown District is to implement the adopted recommendations of the comprehensive plan and Downtown Plan by encouraging new development and redevelopment in the Downtown area. 
The goals of this zoning district are: 
1.  To make the downtown area a sustainable "Great Place" within the region that will attract high quality investment and reinvestment over time. 
2.  To capitalize on the existing historic character of the downtown and provide Rockwall with a thriving downtown center. 
3.  To provide development and land use flexibility within the framework of a form-based development zoning district. 
4.  To provide a mix of residential, retail and office uses in a pedestrian-friendly environment. 
The intent of this zoning district is: 
1.  To provide a comfortable and attractive environment for pedestrians which include such things as buildings framing public space, street trees, lighting and awnings that will attract pedestrians. 
2.  To construct continuous building frontage along block faces except where it is desirable to provide for pedestrian and auto pass-throughs to parking at mid-block. 
3.  To provide shared and consolidated parking both on-street and in the center of blocks that will benefit the entire district. 
4.  To contribute to the definition and use of public sidewalks, parks and plazas. 
5.  To design and build an infrastructure of buildings to accommodate a range of uses over time without the need to destroy older buildings and rebuild them for each successive use. 
6.  To design streets and buildings which will contribute to creating a safe environment. 
II.  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply. 
    Building facade, primary. Any facade that faces a public street or open space. 
    Downtown District engineering and landscape standards (district standards). Any approved city standards which govern such items as street, streetscape, drainage, signage and other public improvements in the Downtown District. 
    Entry, primary. The main entry to a building on a block face. There must be at least one main building entry for each ground floor use, tenant or lobby on each block face which contains the use or tenant. Any additional building entries may be considered a secondary entry. 
    Feature buildings. Buildings which are located on axis with a terminating street or open space, or at the intersection of streets. Such buildings shall incorporate architectural features which address height and articulation that emphasize the importance of such a location. 

    Historic core. See the regulating plan for historic core boundaries which is on file in the city secretary's office. 
    Parking, long-term. Customer or tenant parking which is intended for the primary use of vehicles parked for a duration of more than two hours and neither priced nor managed to encourage turnover. 
    Parking, reserved. Parking which is assigned or reserved for tenants or visitors of a building or business. 
    Parking, shared. Parking which is shared by tenants, visitors and the public. Hours of availability may be further defined in cooperation with the city. 
    Parking, short-term. Customer or tenant parking which is intended to serve commercial businesses or residential uses that has a regular turnover of two hours or less. 
    Regulating plan. The plan approved by the city which applies the Downtown District and which identifies certain subdistricts and the location of required retail at grade, among other items. 
    Stoop. A structure that is located approximately at the level of the first floor of the structure and intended to provide access to a residential unit. 
    Story. That portion of a building, other than a basement, included between the surface of any floor and the surface of the floor next above it, or if there is no floor above it, then the space between the floor and the ceiling above the floor of such story. This includes any mezzanine or loft which may comprise only a portion of a full floor plate. 
    Waiver to design standards, major (major waiver). A significant change to both the standards and intent of this zoning district, and involves planning and zoning commission and city council approval. 
    Waiver to design standards, minor (minor waiver). A minor change to the standards, but not the intent, of this zoning district and involves staff approval. 
III.  General District standards. 
A.  Regulating plan. 
1.  Authority. A regulating plan is the coding key for application of this district's provisions to properties, and shall be considered part of this zoning district. It may establish such things as: 
a.  Major street types within the district; 
b.  Sub-district areas; 
c.  Required at-grade retail construction; 
d.  Public open space and plazas; and 
e.  Regional hike and bike corridors. 
2.  Zoning of Property. 
a.  Downtown Development Plan Required. An approved downtown development plan which is consistent with this [Unified Development Code] and the regulating plan shall be required prior to issuance of any building permit. 
b.  Nonconformity. Uses which are legal and conforming at the time of rezoning to the Downtown District shall continue as legal conforming uses under their current standards until those uses are deemed abandoned, e.g.: 
i.  They have been replaced with a conforming use; 
ii.  Such building or structure is or hereafter becomes vacant and remains unoccupied or out of use for a continuous period of six months, or the special equipment and furnishings peculiar to the nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced within such six-month period; or 
iii.  The intention of the owner to permanently discontinue the use is apparent. 
B.  Waivers of design standards. In order to provide flexibility and create high quality projects, standards in the Downtown District may receive a waiver from City staff, the Planning and Zoning Commission, and/or the City Council. (See subsection VIII.B, Waivers, below, for applicability, processes and procedures.) 
Minor waivers are limited to the following: 
?  Depth or height of required retail space. 
?  Requirement to line a parking garage with buildings. 
?  Requirement for continuous building frontage. 
?  Establishment of build-to line. 
?  Encroachment into the build-to line. 
?  Residential landscape requirement. 
?  Increased building height for "feature" buildings. 
?  Design of buildings without tri-partite architecture. 
?  Required frequency of building entries along a street edge. 
?  Window detailing. 
?  Exterior building materials. 
?  Exterior building color. 
?  Retail at grade design standards. 
?  Balcony and patio railing. 
?  Landscape standards. 
?  Location of bicycle parking. 
Major waivers may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
?  Required retail construction. 
?  Building height for non-feature buildings. 
?  Exceeding the maximum leasable retail area. 
?  Required setback of the fourth floor and above. 
?  Residential at grade design standards. 
?  Parking requirements. 
?  Parking garage design standards. 
C.  Function/land use. 
1.  Land use. 
a.  Retail, personal service, residential and office uses shall be allowed throughout the district. For a specific list of permitted uses, see article IV, Permissible Uses, table 1, Land Use Tables. 
b.  Where "required retail construction" is designated on the regulating plan, the ground floor adjacent to the street shall be constructed to retail building standards for a depth of at least 50 feet, however, a smaller depth may be allowed if the retail is serving as a "liner" use which is masking a parking garage by minor waiver. 
c.  All access drives shall require a minor waiver. 
D.  Block face. It is intended that building walls should be continuous along block faces to create a strong edge to the street and contribute to creating an attractive and active pedestrian environment. Contributing to that goal, however, is to allow some limited variation and opportunities for outside dining, pocket parks and special building entry features. 
1.  Block length. The length of new blocks should not be less than 200 feet, nor more than 600 feet. 
2.  Block faces shall contain continuous building frontage with the exception of a mid-block access to parking which is no greater than 34 feet in width and 16 feet in height. 

"Continuous building frontage" will be considered to be met if the primary building facade is located within five feet of the build-to line requirement. However, administrative approval of a minor waiver will permit up to 15 percent of the building frontage to be up to 15 feet behind the build-to line provided that it results in an attractive outdoor dining area, building entry feature or other amenity which contributes to the streetscape. A greater increase shall require approval of a major waiver. 
3.  Facades shall generally be built parallel to the street frontage, except at street intersections, where a corner facade containing a primary building entrance may be curved or angled toward an intersection. 
4.  Build-to lines (setbacks). 

a.  Build-to lines shall be measured from the planned street back-of-curb, as established on the approved regulating plan for the district and the standards in this [Unified Development Code] (see table 1, Downtown District Standards below), or the city's approved thoroughfare plan. The entire area between the back-of-curb and the primary building facade shall be dedicated as public right-of-way or have a public easement placed upon it. 
b.  Awnings may encroach above the public sidewalk without limit, provided they leave a minimum clearance of 7.5 feet above the sidewalk, and are set back a minimum of 18 inches from the back of curb and will not impede street tree growth. 
E.  Streetscape and landscape. 
1.  Streetscape standards shall be established by the city for sidewalk paving, street trees, tree grates, lighting fixtures, trash receptacles and benches for both residential and nonresidential ground-level frontages. 
2.  Nonresidential ground floor frontages shall not be required to provide additional landscaping beyond that required in the Downtown District engineering and landscape standards. 
3.  Residential ground floor frontages shall be required to landscape a minimum of five feet between the edge of sidewalk and the primary building facade, excluding access to sidewalks, stairs, stoops, porches and patios. This area may be landscaped with ground cover, low shrubs, ornamental trees and street trees. In addition, street tree wells may also be landscaped. Landscaping for tree wells is limited to ground cover and low shrubs.

3 Increased height for feature buildings may be approved as part of site plan approval by minor waiver. Additional height for other buildings shall be considered a major waiver. 
4 Except along Goliad between Washington and Kaufman, where existing building lines will be enforced. 
5 Sidewalk tables may be allowed by the city in retail areas. 
6 Except Rusk between St. Augustine and Alamo Streets where existing historic building lines will be enforced. 
IV.  Buildings. 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this zoning district to create an attractive and active village style district and the size, disposition, function, and design of buildings, play an important role in achieving that goal. 

1.  Buildings should directly contribute to the attractiveness, safety and function of the street and other public areas. 
2.  Buildings that accommodate retail at grade should feature the retail activity over the building's architecture. 
3.  Buildings should be constructed in a manner, and with materials, that are highly durable and will continue to endure and be attractive over a long time, especially adjacent to public and pedestrian areas. 
4.  It is intended by this zoning district to encourage a variety of building and design solutions in response to the standards and regulations outlined herein. 
B.  Building standards. 
1.  Building form. 
a.  The maximum retail area allowed for a single user shall be 40,000 square feet. Any lease which exceeds this size shall require approval of a major waiver. 

b.  All buildings shall be designed and constructed in tri-partite architecture so that they have a distinct base, middle and top. 
c.  Buildings which are located on axis with a terminating street or at the intersection of streets shall be considered a feature building. Such buildings shall be designed with features which take advantage of that location, such as an accentuated entry and a unique building articulation which is off-set from the front wall planes and goes above the main building eave or parapet line. 
2.  Architectural features. 

a.  Buildings which are greater than three stories in height must be set back at the fourth floor at least eight feet behind the building face of the first three floors along street frontages. Any change to this standard shall be considered a major waiver. 
b.  Windows shall have at least a four-inch reveal and except for retail at grade, shall be vertical in proportion. 
c.  No glass curtain wall shall be permitted except by approval of major waiver. 
d.  Each building and separate lease space at grade along the street edge shall have a functioning primary entry from the sidewalk. Such entries must be inset from the front building plane by at least five feet. Secondary entries may be set back as little as three feet. Functioning entries must be located no greater than 30 feet apart. Corner entries may count as a primary entry for both intersecting street frontages. 
e.  Architectural elements of the primary building facade may encroach beyond the build-to line by up to five feet provided that pedestrian flow will not be significantly impeded, with a minor waiver. These elements may include stoops, porches, bay windows, eaves, planters and light wells for a belowgrade floor. Balconies, canopies and awnings are not limited in their encroachment, provided that they do not substantially interfere with pedestrian movement and street tree growth. This does not apply to the historic core. 
3.  External facade materials. The following shall apply to all exterior walls of buildings and parking structures which are clearly visible from a public street, walkway or open space: 
a.  Ground floor exterior walls, excluding windows, doors, and other openings, shall be constructed of 100 percent brick, natural or cast stone on the exterior facade. 
b.  Overall, a minimum of 85 percent of exterior walls which face on a street right-of-way, plaza or open space, excluding windows, doors, and other openings, shall be constructed of brick, natural or cast stone. Where such a wall turns a corner, the surface materials shall continue around the corner a minimum of eight feet. 
c.  The remainder may be constructed of noncombustible materials including exterior stucco and class PB exterior insulating and finishing systems (EIFS). Stucco and EIFS shall be used only for walls, architectural features, and embellishments not subject to pedestrian contact. On wholly residential structures, cementitious fiberboard may be used for up to ten percent of the facade provided it is above the ground floor. 
d.  Unpainted metal, or metal subject to ordinary rusting shall not be used as a building material. Factory finished metal elements as well as metals that develop an attractive oxidized finish, such as copper, galvanized metal, stainless steel or weathering steel, may be used as architectural accents by minor waiver approval. 
e.  Windows and glazing shall be a minimum of 30 percent up to a maximum of 70 percent of each building elevation. (See 6.b below for special requirements for retail at grade.) 
f.  A variation of up to 15 percent of the standards above, and the material type may be approved by administrative approval of a minor waiver, provided that the change will result in an improved architectural design without degrading the quality of public areas or increasing the need for maintenance. 
4.  Color. 
a.  The dominant color of all buildings (including abovegrade parking structures shall be muted shades of warm gray, red, green, beige and/or brown. Black, gold and stark white shall not be used except as an accent color. 
There are no restrictions on accent colors which comprise less than 1.0 percent of the building face, except that florescent colors are prohibited. 
b.  Roof colors shall be a shade of cool gray, warm gray, brown or red. 
5.  Residential at grade. 
a.  All buildings which are constructed for residential units at grade shall include a primary front door entrance into the unit which may be accessed from the sidewalk. Any change to this standard shall be considered a major waiver. 
b.  The entry shall be located a minimum of two feet above the sidewalk elevation and include a minimum 24-square-foot stoop. Any change to this standard shall be considered a major waiver. 
c.  Units must also include windows which provide residents a view of the street and sidewalk area. Any change to this standard shall be considered a major waiver. 
d.  Lobbies to upper stories may be located at grade level. 
e.  Balcony and patio railings and fences shall be constructed of wrought iron or metal. Wood fences and railings and chain-link fencing are prohibited. Masonry columns may be used on patios provided that they are used as accents. 

6.  Nonresidential at grade. 
a.  The ground floor entry must be located at the approximate elevation of the adjacent sidewalk. 
b.  Retail uses adjacent to the sidewalk at grade shall: 
i.  Be constructed to meet fire code separation from any other uses constructed above; 
ii.  Have a minimum clear height of 16 feet between finished floor and the bottom of the structure above. Mezzanines within the retail space shall be allowed per building code; 
iii.  Have a canopy which extends at least six feet over the sidewalk for at least 75 percent of the frontage on any portion of a building located on the north, east or west side of a street and public sidewalk; and 
iv.  Have clear glass windows for at least 60 percent, but no greater than 80 percent, of the ground floor facade. 
No outdoor storage is permitted. Outdoor retail display or sales shall require a permit from the city. 

V.  Parking. 
A.  Automobile parking. 
1.  Intent. The following is the intent of the city's parking policies and the Downtown Zoning District: 
a.  Support the creation of shared parking in order to enable visitors to park once at a convenient location and to access a variety of commercial enterprises in a pedestrian-friendly environment. 
b.  Manage parking so that it is convenient and efficient, and supports an active and vibrant retail environment. 
c.  Ensure visibility and ease of access to parking. 
d.  Maximize on-street parking. 
e.  Provide flexibility for changes in land uses which have different parking requirements within the district. 
f.  Provide flexibility for the redevelopment of small sites. 
g.  Design parking structures so that they do not dominate the public environment by lining the edge of structures with residential or commercial uses. 
h.  Avoid diffused, inefficient single-purpose reserved parking. 
i.  Avoid adverse parking impacts on residential neighborhoods. 
2.  Parking requirements. Off-street and on-street facilities shall be provided as required in article VI of [this Unified Development Code]. 
a.  Parking reductions. 
i.  Properties in the historic core shall receive a credit for the number of parking spaces which would normally be required for retail use on the ground floor of any existing or new structure. To achieve this credit, however, retail or restaurant use must be located on the ground floor. 
ii.  In the remainder of the district, on-street parking which is directly in front of the development site may be counted toward the parking requirement for the development. 
b.  Achieving automobile parking. 
i.  Parking requirements may be met on-site, curb-side, by lease from the city or its designated authority or by payment of cash-in-lieu of parking to the city or its designated authority. 
ii.  Due to the limited land area within the historic core and the need to provide off-site parking, development shall be eligible to receive a reduction in the cost for the payment to the city for the required cash fee or the lease payments. The amount and the terms of the reduction shall be determined by the city manager or his designee by individual agreements. 
iii.  The city manager or designee shall annually establish the following: 
?  The leasing rates for city-provided parking spaces as a result of the need to provide such spaces for new development; and 
?  The cost of construction of a parking space in a parking structure for the purposes of establishing cash-in-lieu payments. 
c.  Parking location. All off-street parking shall be located behind buildings which face on a street or public open space. Any change to this standard shall be considered a major waiver. 
d.  At-grade parking. Any at-grade parking lots fronting roadways which may be approved shall be set back not less than ten feet from the right-of-way line of such roadways, and screened from view as outlined in subsection VII, Landscaping. 
e.  Parking garages. Parking garages that have frontage on public streets shall comply with all setback and build-to standards as established in table 1, Downtown District Standards, and subsection IV.B.3, External Facade Materials. However: 
i.  Parking garages which are adjacent to a street shall be set back a minimum of 50 feet and lined with buildings containing any permitted use but parking. 
ii.  All parking garages shall be constructed with flat parking decks for ease in re-use of all or portions of the structure when parking demand wanes, unless otherwise approved by major waiver. 
iii.  Off-street below grade parking is permitted to the lot lines, but must be designed to allow for utilities and planting of landscape as defined in subsection VII, Landscaping. 
f.  Shared parking. 
i.  Uses may join in establishing shared parking areas if it can be demonstrated that the parking for two or more specific uses occurs at alternating time periods.

3.  Interior parking lot landscape shall be consistent with article VIII, Landscape Standards of the Unified Development Code. 
4.  Parking spaces shall not exceed ten spaces in a row without being interrupted by a landscaped island (nine-foot minimum). Islands shall be planted with a minimum of one shade tree for every ten cars. 
VIII.  Administration. 
A.  Intent. It is the intent that a developer or builder who wishes to develop under this zoning district will be processed in an expedited manner with administrative approvals, and may in fact qualify for incentives under other separate city programs. However, if there are substantial major waivers requested, additional approvals shall be required which may delay development progress. 
B.  Waivers of design standards. 
1.  For the purposes of this district, there shall be two types of waivers of design standards: minor and major. Requests for waivers shall not be subject to review or decision by the zoning board of adjustment. A waiver request may only be made in conjunction with an application for a downtown development plan. 
2.  Minor waivers are those changes to design standards in the Downtown District identified in Subsection III.B. Minor waivers may be approved administratively by the director of planning or his designee in conjunction with a decision on an application for approval of a downtown development plan. All minor waivers must meet the full intent of this zoning district as stated in section I. Appeals to decisions concerning minor waivers may be made to the planning and zoning commission. 
3.  Major waivers are major changes to the design standards in the Downtown District. Major waivers may only be approved by the city council, following a recommendation by the planning and zoning commission, in conjunction with a decision on an application for approval of a downtown development plan. Examples of major waivers are listed in Subsection III.B above; however, the City Council reserves the right to grant a major waiver to any standard not specifically designated as a minor waiver contained in this article pending the City Council finds that the waiver: 
a.  Meets the general intent of this district in which the property is located; 
b.  Will result in an improved project which will be an attractive contribution to the district; and 
c.  Will not prevent the realization of the intent of this district. 
4.  The city may impose conditions on granting any waiver to mitigate negative impacts neighboring properties or public streets or open space. 
C.  Downtown development plan approval. 
1.  Prior to obtaining a building permit, a downtown development plan must be approved by the director of planning or his designee, to certify that it meets the purpose, intent and standards contained in this zoning district. 
2.  Downtown development plans must include the following information: 
a.  Site plan. 
b.  Building elevations and sections. 
c.  Building function/proposed use. 
d.  Parking standards being met. 
e.  Landscape plan. 
f.  Any waivers being requested. 
3.  Applications for downtown development plan approval shall be reviewed within 30 days of being formally accepted by the city. At such time, the approval, approval with conditions or denial shall be forwarded to the applicant. However, applications including a request for a major waiver shall be scheduled for planning and zoning commission and city council action. 
4.  Denial of a downtown development plan may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission and city council within 30 days of notification of such denial. 
D.  Lapse of approval. If a building permit has not been obtained within two years following approval of the downtown development plan, such plan shall lapse unless the property owner requests an extension prior to the expiration of the two-year period. The request for an extension shall be considered by the planning director, or he may at his discretion refer the decision to the planning and zoning commission and city council in the same manner as for approval of the downtown development plan. The director (or council, upon recommendation by the commission) may grant an extension of the time for expiration of the downtown development plan for a period not to exceed one year from the date of initial approval of the application. Every request for an extension shall include a statement of the reasons why the expiration date should be extended. The decision-maker may grant a request for extension upon demonstration that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have resulted in the applicant's inability to perform the tasks necessary to prevent the downtown development plan from expiring before the lapse date. The commission or the council also may terminate the downtown development plan or may attach additional conditions to the extension of the plan. 
E.  Platting in the downtown district. Plats in the Downtown District shall ensure public access easements over sidewalk areas and shared drive access. 
IX.  Downtown district engineering and landscape standards. 
A.  Downtown plan. The Downtown District Engineering and Landscape Standards shall be in accordance with the approved Rockwall Downtown Plan.

SECTION 5: - INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS 

Subsection 5.01: - General Industrial District Standards 
    All industrial development shall conform to the following standards: 
A.  Construction Materials. 
1.  Materials and Masonry Composition. Each exterior wall of a building's façade shall consist of a minimum of 90% Primary Materials and/or a maximum of 10% Secondary Materials, excluding doors and windows, as defined below. 
a.  Primary Materials. Primary Materials shall include stone, brick, glass curtain wall, glass block, tile, and custom Concrete Masonry Units (CMU) (i.e. CMUs that have been sandblasted, burnished or that have a split face-light weight block or smooth faced CMU shall be prohibited). Specific requirements for Primary Materials are as follows: 
1.  Stone. A minimum of 20% stone (i.e. natural or synthetic/cultured) is required on all building façades. 
2.  Cementitious Materials. The use of cementitious materials (e.g. stucco, cementitious lap siding, or similar materials approved by the Director of Planning or his/her designee) shall be limited to 50% of the building's exterior façade; however, stucco shall not be used within the first four (4) feet from grade on a building's façade. The use of concrete tilt-up walls may be permitted on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the exception requirements outlined below. 
3.  Accent Brick and Stone. Each building shall incorporate accent brick or stone, or brick and stone patterns and materials that create contrast through color, shape, size, and/or texture to the planes of the primary brick or stone materials used on each building elevation. 
b.  Secondary Materials. Secondary Materials are any material that is not deemed to be a Primary Material as defined above. This includes materials like aluminum composite materials, metal panels, acrylic products (i.e. EIFS products) cast stone, or other materials identified by the Director of Planning and Zoning or his/her designee. 
2.  Exceptions. Exceptions to the material requirements may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Planning and Zoning Commission upon recommendation from the Architectural Review Board (ARB). The submission and approval of material samples and building elevations of the structure shall be required. If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies an exception request, the applicant may appeal the decision to the City Council by filing a written request to the Planning and Zoning Department. The request should provide justification for the exception being requested (i.e. detail the unique or extraordinary conditions that exist and/or the undue hardship created by strict adherence to the technical requirements). 
B.  Maximum Building Height. 
1.  Setback Exceptions for Building Height in Industrial Districts. All structures shall conform to the height requirements specified for the zoning district of the subject property as stipulated by Section 7.03 , Non-Residential District Development Standards; however, the following features may be constructed 12-feet higher than the maximum height requirement if they (1) are not more than 33% of the total roof area, and (2) are setback from the edge of the roof a minimum of two (2) feet for every one (1) foot that the feature extends above the surface of the roof: 
a.  Chimneys, Church Spires, Elevator Shafts, and similar appendages not intended as places of occupancy and/or storage. 
b.  Flag Poles. 
c.  Solar Collectors and/or Similar Equipment, Fixtures, and Devices. 
C.  Building Articulation. 
1.  Primary Building Façades. A primary building façade is any building façade that has a primary entryway for a business or that has an adjacency to a public right-of-way, open space/green space, public/private park, and/or a residential zoning district or residentially used property. All industrial buildings shall meet the following standards for articulation on primary building façades: 

: Wall Height. The wall height shall be measured from grade to the top of the wall. 
: Wall Length. The maximum wall length shall not exceed four (4) times the wall height ( i.e. 4 × = ). 
: Wall Projection. The minimum wall projection for an entryway/architectural element shall be 25% of the wall height ( i.e. 25% × = ). 
: Entryway/Architectural Element Length. The minimum entryway/architectural element length shall be 33% of the wall height ( i.e. 33% × = ). 
: Projection Height. The entryways/architectural elements shall extend a minimum of 25% of the wall height above the top of the wall ( i.e. 25% × = ). 
: Entryway/Architectural Element Width. The minimum width of the entryway/architectural element shall extend for twice the required wall projection ( i.e. 2 × = ). 
2.  Secondary Building Façade. A secondary building façade is any building façade that does not have a primary entryway or an adjacency to a public right-of-way, open space/green space, public/private park, and/or a residentially zoned district or residentially used property. All industrial buildings shall meet the following standards for articulation on secondary building façades: 

: Wall Height. The wall height shall be measured from grade to the top of the wall. 
: Wall Length. The maximum wall length shall not exceed three (3) times the wall height ( i.e. 3 × = ). 
: Secondary Entryway/Architectural Element Length. The minimum length of the secondary entryway or projecting architectural element shall be 15% of the wall length (i.e. 15% × = ). 
: Secondary Entryway/Architectural Element Width. The minimum wall projection for a secondary entryway/architectural element shall be 15% of the wall height ( i.e. 15% × = ). 
: Projection Height. The secondary entryways/architectural elements shall extend a minimum of 15% of the wall height above the top of the wall ( i.e. 15% × = ). 
3.  Exceptions. Exceptions to the building articulation requirements may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Planning and Zoning Commission pending a recommendation from the Architectural Review Board (ARB). In determining if an exception to the building articulation requirements is appropriate the Planning and Zoning Commission should determine if the proposed request is [1] in conformance with the spirit and intent of the building articulation requirements, and [2] if granting the exception will substantially weaken the City's ability to enforce the general purpose of the building articulation requirements in the future. If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies an exception request, the applicant may appeal the decision to the City Council by filing a written request to the Planning and Zoning Department. The request should provide justification for the exception being requested (i.e. detail the unique or extraordinary conditions that exist and/or the undue hardship created by strict adherence to the technical requirements). 
D.  Open Space Guidelines. Industrial land uses should be designed to be integrated with adjacent land uses, as opposed to separating land uses using physical barriers or screening walls ( unless necessary ). This should be achieved by making industrial developments pedestrian-oriented and easily accessible to adjacent developments through the use of natural buffers, open space and trails. This involves creating trails that connect commercial and residential developments, using landscape buffers that incorporate berms and landscaping to separate residential and non-residential land uses, and utilizing building design to create compatibility with surrounding land uses. 
(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
SUBSECTION 5.02: - LIGHT INDUSTRIAL (LI) DISTRICT 
A.  Purpose. The Light Industrial (LI) District is a zoning district intended to create a limited industrial zone that provides for modern types of industrial land uses. With the exception of hazardous materials/manufacturing, this zone allows the same uses as the Heavy Industrial (HI) District. Limitations have been placed on the uses in this district to significantly restrict outside activities and the storage of materials, noise, vibration, smoke, pollution, fire and explosive hazards, glare and any other potentially adverse externalities. The Light Industrial (LI) District is intended for industrial parks and larger, cleaner types of industries. The manufacturing uses should be conducted within a totally enclosed building, and any activities conducted outside should be screened and buffered to ensure no external effects (e.g. excessive noise or odor) extend beyond the property lines. The locations for these types of industrial land uses are typically a minimum of two (2) acres and average of five (5) to ten (10) acres. These types of development also incorporate open space and significant amounts of land dedicated to landscaping. 
Since this zoning district accommodates limited industrial activities that require substantial screening and buffering requirements, the Light Industrial (LI) District is a suitable zoning designation for high visibility locations (e.g. IH-30 and SH-276) or within a reasonable distance of residential areas as long as they are separated by an appropriate amount of open space. Residential uses should be discouraged from locating directly adjacent to or near the Light Industrial (LI) District to protect these types of businesses from excessive complaints about performance standards. Areas should not be zoned to Light Industrial (LI) District unless they are located on or close to an arterial capable of carrying commercial truck traffic. In industrial parks, internal streets should be of a size and strength to accommodate commercial truck traffic. Businesses locating in the Light Industrial (LI) District should work with the City to ensure that water, wastewater, and drainage capacity is adequate before locating on a particular property. 
B.  Permitted Uses. All land uses permitted within the Light Industrial (LI) District are outlined in Section 1, Land Use Schedule, of Article IV, Permissible Uses. 
C.  Area Requirements. All development within a Light Industrial (LI) District shall conform to Section 5.01 , General Industrial District Standards, and the related standards listed within Section 7.03 , Non-Residential District Development Standards. 
D.  Special District Requirements. 
1.  Manufacturing Operations and Storage. All business and manufacturing operations including storage shall be conducted within a completely enclosed building unless specifically authorized for the use as listed in Section 1, Land Use Schedule, of Article IV, Permissible Uses. 
(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
Subsection 5.03: - Heavy Industrial (HI) District 
A.  Purpose. The City of Rockwall recognizes that some industrial uses cannot be conducted within a totally enclosed building, are not visually attractive, may involve hazardous materials, and could have adverse impacts to adjacent land uses due to noise, odor, pollution, and truck traffic. The Heavy Industrial (HI) District is intended to provide adequate space and site diversification for these types of developments. The development standards in the Heavy Industrial (HI) District are minimal, and allow both large and small industrial uses either on separate small lots or as part of a larger industrial park. Some screening is required, but because of the potential for hazardous or possibly adverse uses, this district should not be located close to residential areas of any type. Areas should not be zoned Heavy Industrial (HI) District unless they are located on or close to an arterial roadway capable of carrying commercial truck traffic. Internal streets in the Heavy Industrial (HI) District should be of a size and strength to accommodate commercial truck traffic. Businesses locating in the Heavy Industrial (HI) District should work with the City to ensure that water, wastewater, and drainage capacity is adequate before locating on a particular property. 
B.  Permitted Uses. All land uses permitted within the Heavy Industrial (HI) District are outlined in Section 1, Land Use Schedule, of Article IV, Permissible Uses. 
C.  Area Requirements. All development within a Heavy Industrial (HI) District shall conform to Section 4.01 , General Industrial District Standards, and the related standards listed within Section 7.03 , Non-Residential District Development Standards. 
(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
SECTION 6: - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

Subsection 6.01: - Overlay Districts 
    Overlay districts are applied to land that has a traditional zoning district designation already applied to it. It establishes additional uses and standards, which may be either more or less restrictive than the underlying zoning district. The overlay district governs in all cases where it sets out a particular use or standard that conflicts with other sections of this Unified Development Code (UDC). In cases where the overlay district does not specifically address a standard or requirement, the underlying zoning district will govern. 
(Ord. No. 18-47, § 4, 11-19-2018) 
Subsection 6.02: - General Overlay District Standards 
A.  Applicability. The General Overlay District Standards shall be applied to the following overlay districts: 
?  IH-30 Overlay (IH-30 OV) District 
?  SH-205 Overlay (SH-205 OV) District 
?  Scenic Overlay (SOV) District 
?  SH-66 Overlay (SH-66 OV) District 
?  SH-205 By-Pass Overlay (SH-205 BY OV) District 
?  North SH-205 Overlay (N. SH-205 OV) District 
?  East SH-66 Overlay (E. SH-66 OV) District 
?  FM-549 Overlay (FM-549 OV) District 
?  SH-276 Overlay (SH-276 OV) District

Subsection 6.03: - Historic Overlay (HO) District 
A.  Purpose. The protection, enhancement and perpetuation of districts and landmarks of historical and cultural importance and significance are necessary to promote the economic, cultural, educational and general welfare of the public. It is recognized that within the city numerous areas, sites and structures represent the unique confluence of time and place that shaped the identity of generations of citizens, collectively and individually, and produced significant historic, architectural and cultural resources that constitute their heritage, and therefore this overlay district is intended to: 
1.  Protect and enhance the district and landmarks which represent distinctive elements of the city's historic, architectural and cultural heritage; 
2.  Foster civic pride in the accomplishments of the past; 
3.  Protect and enhance the city's attractiveness to visitors and the support and stimulus to the economy thereby provided; 
4.  Ensure the harmonious, orderly and efficient growth and development of the city; 
5.  Promote economic prosperity and welfare of the community by encouraging the most appropriate use of such property within the city; 
6.  Stabilize and improve values of such properties. 
7.  Promote education of significance and importance of historical preservation including the exploration of tax incentives (federal, state or local) that may apply to individual property owners or properties within the historic district as a whole; and 
8.  Provide guidance to property owners restoring and/or rehabilitating historic significant in an effort to maintain the historical integrity of the area. 
B.  Terms and definitions. The following terms and definitions are used in the historic district ordinance and the historic guidelines.

1.  It was present during the period of significance and possesses historical integrity reflecting its character at that time or is capable of yielding important information about the period, or 
2.  It independently meets the National Register criteria. The level by which a property is "contributing" (high-, medium- and low-contributing property) was originally determined by a historic survey of the properties within the (HO) Historic Overlay District implemented by the city community development department through the spring and summer of 2000. This survey may be amended from time to time. 
    District. A designated area within the preservation district or elsewhere in the city subject to the requirements and standards of the historic district ordinance. An identifying name will precede the word "district". 
    Guidelines. The adopted historic district design guidelines. 
    Landmark property. A property or structure(s), not contiguous to or part of an existing historic district that is deemed worthy of preserving. 
    Non-contributing structure. A building, site, structure, or object which does not add to the historical architectural qualities, historical associations, or archaeological value for which a property or district is significant because 
1.  It was not present during the period of significance, or 
2.  Due to alterations, disturbances, additions, or other changes it no longer possesses historic integrity reflecting its character at that time or is incapable of yielding important information about the period, or 
3.  It does not independently meet the National Register criteria.

e.  Painting of a masonry surface not previously painted. For other painting, see design guidelines, residential properties Section III.M. 
Any addition or deletion of landscape materials or landscape design elements need not receive a certificate of appropriateness from the council. It is recommended, however, that all proposed landscaping used in the district be extracted from the "recommended plant list" as provided in the landscape ordinance of the city. City staff shall maintain a list of plant material that is appropriate for all designated historic areas. 
Any person wishing to paint a structure within a historic district may do so without receiving a certificate of appropriateness from the board. City staff and/or the board shall provide review and comment as requested by the property owner about color selection and design. Such review and comment, however, shall not be binding. 
The board may recommend guidelines to enable the historic preservation officer to issue a certificate of appropriateness for exterior restorations and renovations requiring a building permit. 
G.  Application procedure. 
1.  Application form. Prior to the commencement of any work requiring a COA the owner shall file with the historic preservation officer an application for such a certificate. The application, a copy of which is available as Exhibit (2) of the historic design guidelines, shall contain: 
a.  Name, address, telephone number of applicant, detailed description of proposed work. 
b.  Location of the proposed work (street address) and photographs of the property and adjacent properties. (Historical photographs also may be helpful.) 
c.  Elevation drawings of the proposed changes, if available, and preferably in color. 
d.  Samples of materials to be used, if requested by the board.

f.  Site plan in accordance with the Unified Development Code, if applicable. 
g.  Any other information which the board may deem necessary in order to visualize the proposed work, and any additional material the applicant wishes to submit. 
2.  Building permit. A COA issued by the board is required before a building permit will be issued for any work. 
3.  Time frame for actions. The board shall deny, approve, or approve the COA with modifications within 60 days from receipt of the completed application and supporting documentation. The board shall hold a public hearing on the application at which an opportunity will be provided for proponents and opponents of the application to present their views. 
Should the board not take action within the 60-day period, the COA shall be automatically referred to the city council for their approval or denial, following a public hearing. 
4.  Written decisions. All decisions of the board shall be in writing. An approved certificate of appropriateness shall be sent to the applicant and a copy filed with the city secretary's office for public inspection. The board's decision shall state the reasons for denying or modifying any application. 
5.  Standards for approval. The historic preservation advisory board must approve the application for a certificate of appropriateness if it determines that: 
a.  For contributing structures, the application will not adversely affect the character of the site; and the proposed work is consistent with the regulations contained in this section and proposed preservation criteria; or 
b.  For non-contributing structures, the proposed work is compatible with the historic district. 
6.  Public hearing. A public hearing before the board is required as defined in subsection E.6 before a decision can be made on a zoning recommendation forwarded to the planning and zoning commission. 
a.  The board shall hold a public hearing on all actions considered and appeals made to it. Said public hearing shall be held, when necessary, on the third Thursday of the month. In cases where this "regularly scheduled" meeting date is not appropriate (e.g., in cases as set forth under section I, emergency procedure) an alternative meeting date will be set. 
b.  Written notice of the public hearing shall be sent to the applicant, all persons who are owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the subject property and to all other persons deemed by the board to be affected. 
c.  Written notice shall be given not less than ten days before the date set for the public hearing to all such owners of record as the ownership appears on the current on-line tax roll. The notice may be served by deposition of the same, properly addressed and postage paid, in the U.S. Post Office. 
H.  Actions after board decision. 
1.  Appeal process. If the certificate of appropriateness is denied, the applicant may appeal to the city council by filing a written notice with the historic preservation officer within ten business days after the decision of the board. In considering an appeal, the sole issue before the city council shall be whether the board erred in its decision. The city council shall consider the same standards and evidence that was considered in making the decision. Appeal to the council constitutes the final administrative remedy. 
If the certificate of appropriateness is approved, any property owner within the subject historic district aggrieved by any decision of the board may appeal to the city council. Said appeals may be made by filing a written notice with the historic preservation officer within ten business days after the decision of board. 
2.  Reapplication. If an appeal is denied by both the board and the council, no further applications may be considered for the subject matter of the denied certificate of appropriateness for one year from the date of the final decision unless: 
a.  The certificate of appropriateness has been denied without prejudice; or 
b.  The board waives the time limitation because it that there are changes or circumstances sufficient to warrant a new hearing. A simple majority vote by the board is required to grant the request for the waiver of the time limitation. 
3.  Suspension of work. After the work authorized by the certificate of appropriateness is commenced, the applicant must make continuous progress towards completion of the work, and shall not suspend or abandon the work for a period of more than 180 days. The historic preservation officer and/or building official may, in writing, authorize a suspension of work for a period greater than 180 days upon written request by the applicant showing circumstances beyond his control. 
I.  Emergency procedure. If any applicable structure is damaged and the building official determines that it is a public safety hazard or will suffer additional damage without immediate repair, the building official may allow the property owner to temporarily protect the structure whether or not the materials used conform to the guidelines. However, in such a case, the property owner must then apply for a certificate of appropriateness for the restoration, rebuilding, remodeling, demolition or removal of the structure within ten days of the occurrence that caused the damage. The temporary protection authorized under this subsection must not permanently alter the architectural features of the structure. 
J.  Demolition. 
1.  Requires a certificate of appropriateness. A certificate of appropriateness is required prior to receiving a permit for demolition of a property within a historic district, including secondary buildings. An application for demolition of a contributing structure on the grounds of hardship may be filed. The applicant must establish the following elements to prove hardship: 
a.  The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible; and 
b.  The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return; and 
c.  Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it have failed; and/or 
d.  The structure or property is in such condition as to be irreparably damaged and as such poses a nuisance to the surrounding area and is a "threat" to the health, safety and general welfare of the community. 
2.  Demolition delay. The historic preservation officer upon receipt of an application for a demolition permit of a subject property designation as a historic landmark or located within a designated historic district shall forward on the application for demolition to the historic preservation advisory board for consideration at their next regularly scheduled meeting. 
a.  The issuing of a demolition permit shall be delayed for minimum of 60 days from the date of approval of an application by the historic preservation advisory board. 
b.  During this 60-day delay, the historic preservation officer shall work with the historic preservation advisory board to notify all potentially interested parties of the pending demolition in order to allow such parties to take whatever steps they deem appropriate to accomplish the preservation of the subject property. 
c.  If it is determined by the director of planning in consultation with the historic preservation officer that a property poses an immediate threat to the public health and safety, this determination shall be reported to the city manager who may instruct the building official to issue a demolition permit without delay. 
3.  Expiration. A certificate of appropriateness for the demolition or removal expires if the work authorized by the certificate for demolition or removal is not commenced within 180 days from that date of the issuance of the certificate for demolition. 
K.  Enforcement. All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness (COA) issued under this Unified Development Ordinance shall conform to all requirements included therein. It shall be the duty of the building inspection department to periodically inspect any such work to assure compliance. In the event work is found that is not being performed in accordance with the COA, the building inspection department may suspend the COA, issue a stop work order and all work shall immediately cease. No further work shall be undertaken on the project as long as a stop work order is in effect. A certificate of appropriateness may be reinstated, any stop work order lifted, and work may resume upon assurance that compliance will henceforth exist. 
L.  Ordinary maintenance. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance and repair of any exterior architectural feature of a landmark or property within a historic district that does not involve a change in design or material. In-kind replacement or repair is included in this definition of ordinary maintenance. 
M.  Preservation incentives. To promote the goal of stabilizing and improving values of properties within the district, and encourage the rehabilitation and stabilization of structures, the city council by resolution may offer tax incentives. 
N.  Minimum maintenance standards. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a landmark or a property located within a district shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the significant deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the judgment of the HPAB, create a detrimental effect upon the historic character of the landmark or district. 
1.  Serious disrepair and significant deterioration examples. Examples of serious disrepair or significant deterioration include: 
a.  Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations, or other vertical support that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling. 
b.  Deterioration of external chimneys that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling. 
c.  Deterioration or crumbling of exterior plaster finishes, surfaces or mortars. 
d.  Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, and foundations, including broken windows or doors. 
e.  Defective protection or lack of weather protection for exterior wall and roof coverings, including lack of paint, or weathering due to lack of paint or other protective covering. 
f.  Rotting, holes, and other forms of material decay. 
g.  Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails, window and door frames, cornices, entablatures, wall facings, and architectural details that causes delamination, instability, loss of shape and form, or crumbling. 
h.  Deterioration that has a detrimental effect upon the special character of the district as a whole or the unique attributes and character of the contributing structure. 
i.  Deterioration of any exterior feature so as to create or permit the creation of any hazardous or unsafe conditions to life, health, or other property. 
O.  Procedure to mitigate demolition by neglect. Demolition by neglect refers to the gradual deterioration of a property when routine or minimum maintenance is not performed. The HPO and the development services department staff shall work together in an effort to reduce demolition by neglect involving landmarks or properties located within districts within the city. A demolition by neglect citation as determined by the HPAB may be issued against the owner of the property for failure to comply with the minimum maintenance standards by permitting the subject property to exhibit serious disrepair or significant deterioration as outlined in section N herein. 
1.  Due to the time consuming nature of pursuing enforcement under this section, no more than one property will be under consideration during each of the following quarters (January- March, April-June, July-September, and October- December). 
2.  While the HPO will act as the point of contact, the development services department staff shall, when needed, assist with inspections. If there is a dispute between the HPO and development services department staff, the city manager may be consulted as a mitigating party. 
3.  Citation procedures. The procedure for citing a property for Demolition by Neglect shall be as follows: 
a.  Initial identification is made by visual inspection of the area by the HPO or an HPAB member or by referral from someone in the area. All referrals shall be made in writing and shall be submitted to the HPO. 
b.  Once the initial identification is made, followed by a preliminary determination by the HPO, the property owner shall be notified by US mail of the defects of the building and informed of various incentive programs that may be available for repair. The owner is given 30 days in which to respond to the preliminary determination by submitting a stabilization proposal to HPO. The stabilization proposal will be presented to the HPAB at the next available meeting. If the HPAB approves the proposal, a certificate of appropriateness (if necessary) may be issued administratively by the HPO. The approval will detail the specific work which is necessary to correct the demolition by neglect conditions, as well as a time period to begin and complete the work. The HPO shall update the HPAB on the status of the property every 30 days once work begins on the property. 
c.  If the property owner receives the letter regarding the preliminary determination, but fails to respond, a second notice shall be sent in the same manner as described above. 
d.  If the property owner fails to receive and/or respond to the letter regarding the preliminary determination after two attempts, the matter returns to the HPAB for a citation hearing. The HPO shall send a third notice via certified mail informing the owner of the hearing, the property is posted with a notice of the violation in accordance with the provisions of this article, and a public hearing on the citation is scheduled. 
e.  At the public hearing the owner is invited to address the HPAB's concerns and to show cause why a citation should not be issued. The HPAB may take action to approve any proposed work, defer the matter to give the owner more time either to correct the deficiencies or make a proposal for stabilization, or issue a citation to the owner of the property for failure to correct the demolition by neglect conditions. 
f.  If the owner is cited for the condition of demolition by neglect of the property, he is given 14 days to submit a stabilization proposal to the HPO, and at the discretion of the HPAB, up to one year to correct the defects. The HPO shall update the HPAB on the status of the property every 30 days once work begins on the property. 
g.  If the owner does respond with a stabilization proposal, the matter is turned over to the city attorney in which case the citation will be taken forward to the municipal court where the city attorney shall request the court allow the property owner the time prescribed by the HPAB to correct the defects as described in section F.

Subsection 6.04: - North Goliad Corridor Overlay (NGC OV) District 
A.  Purpose. The North Goliad Corridor Overlay District is a specialized zoning district overlay along North Goliad Street beginning north of the Downtown District and terminating at Live Oak Street. This Corridor has been identified as one of the important entry points into the City of Rockwall. The district has been established to protect scenic and historic qualities through the use of additional development criteria. The district establishes design standards to guide the new construction and rehabilitation of buildings, streetscapes and architectural styles consistent with the existing historic residential homes and businesses located along the corridor. 
B.  Application and boundaries. The boundaries of the North Goliad Corridor Overlay District are as established in the official zoning map of the City of Rockwall. The boundary generally extends from Olive Street north to Live Oak and being more particularly described herein as Exhibit "A" [Ord. No. 07-30, Exhibit A which is on file in the city secretary's office]. use or change of use within the North Goliad Corridor Overlay District. 
All property developed within the Overlay District must meet both the terms and requirements of the underlying zoning classification applicable to the property and the provisions set forth in the Overlay District. The most restrictive requirement applicable to the property shall apply. 
C.  Architectural standards. Most of the historic architecture of the district does not follow one specific style, but is influenced by many. The development along the corridor is an eclectic mix of buildings, but there is a similar vocabulary in the building design and construction materials. The development for the residential and commercial buildings shall generally fit within one or more of the following architectural styles. 
Bungalow 

The bungalow style is a unique house type that borrows from other cultures, but is a truly American design. Developed on the west coast, the bungalow reduces the distinction between inside and outside space, reflecting open practical living. It is generally a low, small house that used natural materials and relief on simplified design. The roof structure is most often broad gables, often with a separate lower gable covering the porch, although hipped roof structures are also common. There is little ornamentation, and what is found is of simplified design. The first bungalow development period was from 1895 to 1915. 
Cottage 

A cottage is basically a small frame single-family home that does not use any particular architectural style or ornamentation pattern. Roof styles vary, but most often use gable, hip or a combination of the two. This is a style that often borrows elements from classic styles, but does not incorporate other elements that make the style unique. 
Craftsman 

An extension of the early bungalow, the craftsman design included a low-pitched gabled roof with a wide, unenclosed eave overhang. Roof rafters are usually exposed and decorative beams or braces are commonly added under gables. Porches are either full or partial-width, with a roof often supported by tapered square columns. The most distinctive features of this are the junctions where the roof joins the wall, where the most ornamentation occurs. This was the dominant style for smaller homes from 1905 to early 1920s. The popularity of the style faded quickly, however, and few were built after 1930. 
Folk Victorian 

The folk Victorian style uses a simple, folk type house style that is often one story and has a roof that is gabled or hipped (pyramidal). It lacks the intricate, irregular roof structure of the Queen Anne style, but includes ornamentation common to Victorian-style detailing, especially spindle work. Facades are generally symmetrical. 
Queen Anne 

The Queen Anne architectural style was common from about 1880 to 1910. Identifying features include a steeply pitched, irregular shaped roof, often with a dominant front-facing gable, patterned shingles, cutaway bay windows, and other features to avoid a smooth walled appearance. The decorative detailing is usually of two types: 
1.  Spindle work includes turned posts and may also include decorative gables and ornamentation under the wall overhangs. 
2.  Free classic detailing uses classical columns, instead of delicate turned posts, and other ornamentation is less "lacy" and delicate than that found in spindle work. This style became common after 1890. 
D.  Building design. The height of new buildings shall not exceed this Unified Development Code standards: generally one and two stories are allowed (36 feet maximum). New building additions and alterations should be compatible with the adjoining area and not exceed height, lot coverage and floor area ratio requirements as specified in this Unified Development Code. 
The use of consistent architectural styles from the years 1870 to 1940 is strongly encouraged rather than additions or alterations from more recent or different design styles (see architectural styles in subsection C of this section for examples). 
New construction should include elements such as cladding, roofing material, roof structure and ornamentation common to the district. 
The existing pattern of building facades generally respecting pedestrian or human scale design should be incorporated into new development projects. Roof types generally associated with residential buildings such as gable, hip or gambrel are also appropriate for structure within the North Goliad Corridor Overlay District. 
All decorative fixtures, including awnings, signs and lighting, shall be integrated with other design elements of the structures. 
Building elevations shall be submitted as part of the development application for review by the historic preservation advisory board who shall make its recommendations to planning and zoning commission. Perspectives, accurate sections or a model of the project may be required to depict the height, mass and scale of the proposed project with respect to its setting and adjacent development. 
E.  Parking area restrictions. Any surface parking shall be provided in well-screened parking lots at the rear or behind the main facade of the building. All parking structures shall adhere to the standards of this Unified Development Code and any additional requirements of the underlying zoning district. 
F.  Cross access. Cross access easements may be required by the planning commission and/or city council at the time of site plan approval or platting to ensure access between adjoining properties and to reduce the number of needed curb cuts. 
G.  Accessory buildings. New accessory or outbuildings, including garages and enclosures for service areas, trash or recycle containers, or storage structures should be compatible with materials, textures, colors and architectural styles of the principle buildings. 
H.  Landscaping standards. Existing trees should be retained where possible. Street trees and other sidewalk area landscaping shall be incorporated if pedestrian circulation will not be obstructed. Front yards should be landscaped compatible with the majority of neighboring properties. All sites shall, as a minimum, meet the requirements of article VIII, Landscape Standards. 
I.  Signs. All signs shall comply with [chapter 32 of the Code of Ordinances] (sign ordinance) and the underlying zoning district that applies to the North Goliad Corridor Overlay District and to the following additional standards. Signs shall be freestanding with two support standards. The maximum size shall be 16 square feet and shall not impede pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic. Monument signs are not allowed. All lighted signs shall be indirectly light no direct or internally light sign shall be allowed. All lighting elements such as wires, junction boxes, transformers, switches and panel boxes shall be concealed from view. 

J.  Lighting standards. In addition to the requirements of the outdoor lighting requirements no light pole, pole base or combination thereof shall exceed 20 feet in the North Goliad Corridor Overlay District. All lighting fixtures shall focus light downward and be contained on the site. Lighting elements shall be incandescent, metal Halide, or halogen only. No HID or fluorescent lights (except fluorescent bulbs that screw into standard socket fixtures) may be used on the exterior of buildings. All street lighting shall meet the specifications contained in article V, section 4.07 Downtown (DT) District included in section VI, Streetscape, Lighting and Mechanical, and as attached herein. 

K.  Variance. The city council may, upon request from the applicant, grant a variance to any provision of this section where unique or extraordinary conditions exist or where strict adherence to the provisions of this section would create a hardship. Approval of any variance to any provision of this section shall require city council approval by a three-quarter majority vote of those city council members present with a minimum of four affirmative votes.

Article VI - PARKING AND LOADING 
SECTION 1. - PURPOSE 

Sec. 1.1. - Parking. 
    The purpose of this article is to regulate the number of required off-street vehicular parking spaces so as: 
  To provide for the needs of occupants, customers, visitors or others involved in the use or occupancy of any building, structural improvement or place of assembly; 
  To eliminate undue use of the street system for parking purposes; 
  To avoid the occurrence of nonresident on-street parking in adjoining neighborhoods; 
  To protect the environment by promoting trip reduction and efficient land use through an analytic process in which the amount of parking may be limited to what is realistically needed for the uses on the site, thus reducing concrete/asphalt areas, heat islands and air pollution; 
  To promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare; and 
  To grant and define the administrative powers and duties necessary to enforce this article. 
Sec. 1.2. - Loading. 
    It is also the purpose of this article to require allocation of sufficient off-street/on-site loading facilities by businesses and industry to ensure that the loading and unloading of vehicles will not interfere with traffic flow or block roadways or fire lanes. 
SECTION 2. - APPLICABILITY 

Sec. 2.1. - Construction or creation of use. 
    Any building, improvement, or use of land approved or erected shall include the necessary off-street parking spaces, and require off-street/on-site loading facilities subject to the standards established in this article. 
Sec. 2.2. - Change of use. 
    Whenever any building, improvement, or use of land is proposed to be changed to a new use, the provision of off-street parking and loading shall be required for the new use in accordance with this article. 
Sec. 2.3. - Expansion of an existing use. 
    If any building, improvement, or use of land is expanded, the provisions for parking and loading shall be provided for the portion of land use and/or building that has been added. 
Sec. 2.4. - Renovation or redevelopment. 
    Notwithstanding subsection 2.2 above, if any building, improvement, or use of land is repaired, renovated, altered, expanded or redeveloped, and the cost of such changes exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the building improvement prior to the subject improvements, the parking and loading facilities set forth in this article shall be made conforming, unless a specific use permit has been approved for such reduction in the provision of parking or loading. 
SECTION 3. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 3.1. - Calculation of spaces. 
A.  Fractional number of spaces. In determining the required number of parking spaces, fractional spaces shall be counted to the nearest whole space. Parking spaces located in buildings used for repair garages or auto laundries shall not be counted as meeting the required minimum parking. 
B.  Parking structures excluded. Floor area of structures devoted to off-street parking of vehicles shall be excluded in computing the floor area for off-street parking requirements. 
C.  Requirements for uses not listed. The off-street parking requirements for a use not specifically listed in the schedule below shall be the same as required for a use of a similar nature as determined by the director of planning. 
Sec. 3.2. - Paving materials. 
    All required parking and loading areas, public and private drives, and fire lanes shall be constructed of concrete, but may have a surface treatment of brick, stone or other similar material. However, cast interlocking concrete, brick, or stone pavers installed on a prepared base may be used in parking areas and on public and private drives where approved by the city engineer. 
Sec. 3.3. - Location of commercial parking and loading spaces. 
    The required off-street parking and loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building or use served; except, off-street parking may also be located as follows: 
A.  Parking may be located off-site. 
1.  When an increase in the number of off-street parking spaces is required by a change or enlargement of use, or where off-street parking spaces are provided collectively or used jointly by two or more buildings or establishments, the required off-street parking spaces may be located at a distance not to exceed 400 feet from the building being served; provided, however, that a written agreement thereto is properly executed and filed as provided below. 
2.  The distance from the land use requiring parking to the off-site parking site shall be measured along the shortest legal pedestrian path between one site and the other. 
3.  All off-site parking must first be approved by city council. 
B.  Joint use of parking. Parking adjustments may be allowed according to the following percentages by time of day:

Article VII - ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 
SECTION 1. - PURPOSE 
    The purpose of this article is to set forth regulations which protect the public from the potential negative effects of industrial and intense commercial development by regulating smoke and particulate matter, odorous matter, fire or explosive materials, toxic and noxious matter, vibration, open storage, glare and fuel supply in the vicinity of such sites. 
SECTION 2. - APPLICABILITY 
    The following performance standards shall apply to all zoning districts in the City of Rockwall. 
SECTION 3. - OUTDOOR LIGHTING FOR NONRESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES 

Sec. 3.1. - Definitions. 
    Candela means a measurement quantified in unit(s) of luminous intensity in any given direction. It is also commonly referred to as candlepower(s). 
    Floodlight means an artificial illumination in broad beam, above 15 watts with a light source that extends more than two inches below the horizontal plane of the laminar. 
    Footcandle or FC means the amount of illumination provided by one lumen uniformly distributed on one square foot of surface. 
(Ord. No. 10-14, § 50, 7-6-2010) 
    Full cut-off means a light source that does not extend below the horizontal plan of the luminaire. 
    Light source means the device which produces visible energy, such as a bulb. 
    Lumen means the quantity of luminous flux intercepted by a surface of one square foot, all points of which are one foot from a uniform source of one candela. A one-candela source provides 12.57 lumens. 
    Luminaire means a complete lighting unit including a light source and all necessary mechanical, electrical, reflective, and decorative parts. 
    Partial cut-off means a light source that extends no more than one inch below the horizontal plan of luminaire. 
(Ord. No. 10-14, § 50, 7-6-2010) 
    Standard means the light pole and base. 
    Temporary holiday lighting means the type of lighting typically used during the holiday periods. 
Sec. 3.2. - Prohibited lighting. 
    It shall be unlawful to display or operate the following: 
A.  An unshielded light source, including bare bulbs, above 15 watts, except for temporary holiday lighting. 
B  The operation of search lighting is prohibited except it shall be permitted for a period not to exceed 14 days from grand openings and promotional events with permission of the building official. 
Sec. 3.3. - Minimum requirements. 
A.  Glare. In order to preserve the night sky and to reduce glare on roadways, pedestrian areas and adjacent development, light sources (e.g. light bulbs) shall be oriented down and toward the center of the site or shielded so as to not be visible from the property line. This applies to refractory lenses which extend beyond the lighting fixture and are designed to redirect the lighting source horizontally. This does not apply to neon or internally lit signs, or to decorative lighting with 15 watts or less per bulb. 
B.  Light at residential property line. The allowable maximum light intensity measured at the property line of a residentially zoned lot shall be 0.2 of one footcandle. 
C.  Light at nonresidential property line. The allowable maximum light intensity measured at the property line of any nonresidentially zoned lot shall be 0.2 of one footcandle. For planned shopping centers or other commercial developments that contain more than one lot, the planning and zoning commission may consider lighting plans that are intended to increase lighting efficiency and reduce the number of overall light fixtures, but result in light spillover across common lot lines within the same development. However, in no case shall light levels exceed 0.2 FC at the property lines adjacent to the street and/or along the perimeter of the development. 
(Ord. No. 10-14, § 51, 7-6-2010) 
D.  Height. No light pole, base or combination thereof shall exceed 30 feet, unless further restricted within an Overlay District as specified in article V of this [Unified Development] Code.

Sec. 5.8. - Right-of-way landscaping requirements. 
    All street rights-of-way located adjacent to the proposed development shall be improved with grass or ground cover material and shall be maintained. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to design the irrigation system within the lot to ensure that the grass placed in the right-of-way is watered and maintained and to ensure that minimal water will enter the street itself. The designer of the irrigation system shall base the design on the ultimate proposed width of the street when designing the system. The plans for design of the irrigation system shall be approved by the city prior to installation. 
Sec. 5.9. - Parking lot landscaping. 
A.  Any parking lot with more than two rows of spaces shall have a minimum of five percent or 200 square feet, whichever is greater, in the interior of the parking lot in landscaping. Such landscaping shall be counted toward the total landscaping.

1.  No required parking space may be located more than 80 feet from the trunk of a large canopy tree. 
2.  No tree may be planted closer than 21/2 feet to the pavement. 
3.  All trees must be internal to the parking lot. 
Sec. 5.10. - Xeriscaping standards. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the establishment of water conscious landscaping through the implementation of xeriscaping principles. Additionally, this section is intended to provide an alternative to the typical landscape requirements for commercial properties. 
B.  Principles. All xeriscaping plans submitted to the city should demonstrate conformance with the following principles: 
1.  Planning and design. Landscape designs and plans should take into account the regional and microclimatic conditions of the site, its existing vegetation and topographical conditions, the intended use, and the zoning (i.e. vegetation zone) of plant materials according to their unique water needs. Plans should take into account the various heights of landscaping materials. If the landscape plan is proposed in phases, to account for optimum planting times, all future phases should be included on the submitted landscape plan. In reviewing plans to ensure proper site planning and design, staff shall ensure that the plan: 1) preserves and protects existing vegetation, 2) preserves and protects topsoil, 3) stabilizes and covers all bare soil areas, and 4) incorporates energy/water conservation. 
2.  Soil improvement. Since soil tends to vary from site to site all soil should be analyzed to determine what plants are suitable to include on the landscape plan and if any soil amendments are required. Soil may require additional organic material be added to ensure the continued health of plants. 
3.  Appropriate plant selection. Plant selection should be based on the plant's adaptability to the existing site conditions and need for supplemental watering. Most xeriscape plants will not require supplemental watering. In selecting plant materials, mature plants and shrubs should be used to ensure establishment after installation. A list of plants that are native and acceptable within the city has been provided in Appendix F, Recommended Plantings, of the Unified Development Code; however, staff may approve alternate plantings if they are deemed appropriate for the site. In reviewing plans for conformance to this principle staff will consider the: 1) diversity of the plant species being proposed, 2) size, maturity and water requirements of the selected plantings, and 3) variation of height, spread and color. 
4.  Practical turf areas. The type and location of turf areas are considered to be a major design element in xeriscape plans. Turf in this case involves typical varieties of Bermuda, St. Augustine, Ryegrass blends, etc. The maintenance needs of turf can be minimized by the shape, area, irrigation equipment, and turf type selected. Drainage areas and sloped areas are especially suited to the use of native grasses as opposed to turf. In reviewing plans to ensure that the turf areas being proposed are practical staff will review: 1) the design of the turf areas (with rounded, compact turf areas being more efficient), 2) turf areas should be designed to be on a separate zone from other landscaping, 3) turf should be appropriate for the selected location, 4) turf should be avoided on slopes and drainage areas in favor of native grasses, and 5) minimize turf areas by using native grasses, hardscape elements and alternatives. 
5.  Efficient irrigation. All landscaping is required to have an irrigation system that is designed by a licensed irrigator. Additionally, all irrigation systems should be designed to be water efficient utilizing low-flow irrigation equipment. The plan should show that turf areas should be watered separately, and plants should be grouped in separate zones based on water need. Finally, all irrigation systems are required to be maintained in proper working order. 
6.  Use of mulches. Mulches minimize evaporation, reduce weed growth, slow erosion and help maintain soil temperature. In reviewing the use of mulches in xeriscape plans staff shall ensure: 1) the use of a deep layer of mulch in planting beds (typically three to four inches) is utilized, and 2) mulches should be locally or regionally derived materials. Additionally, mulches may include the use of pea gravel, crushed granite, rock or pebbles in unplanted areas. 
7.  Appropriate maintenance. Proper pruning, weeding and fertilization as required with all landscape plans shall be required. Typically, xeriscape plans require less maintenance, fertilizer and other chemicals and pesticides. 
C.  Standards. 
1.  If approved with a Landscape Plan native grasses shall be exempt from the rules and requirements of section 16-43, weeds, brush and grass; however, the grass should be maintained to a height typical for the particular native grass. 
2.  Drainage or detention areas that utilize native grasses in lieu of turf shall be exempt from the requirements stipulated by section 5.12.C (i.e. one tree per every 750 square feet of dry land area). Instead, a shrub or ornamental grass per every 1,500 square feet of dry land area shall be required to be planted on the site or around the detention area. 
3.  A maximum of 30 percent mulches or hardscape is permitted to be incorporated into all xeriscape plans. This may be increased by the planning and zoning commission if deemed appropriate and necessary for the proposed plan. 
D.  Approval of xeriscape plans. All xeriscape plans shall require approval by the planning and zoning commission, upon a recommendation by staff concerning conformance to the requirements of this section, at the time of site plan approval. 
(Ord. No. 15-32, § 2, 12-7-2015)

SECTION 5. - TREE MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS 
    The tree mitigation requirements shall apply for all properties that do not fall under the exemptions listed in section 1.3, Exemptions, of this article. In addition, if a treescape plan or tree removal permit allows for the removal of a protected or feature tree(s), the applicant and/or property owner shall account for the number of inches of tree being removed using the following criteria: 
1.  Primary protected trees. Primary protected trees measuring four inches through 25 inches DBH shall be replaced on an inch-for-inch basis (i.e. the total number of caliper inches of tree being replaced shall equal the total number of caliper inches being removed). 
2.  Secondary protected trees. Hackberry and cedar trees measuring 11 inches through 25 inches DBH shall be replaced with a half-inch for every inch removed (i.e. the total number of caliper inches of tree required to be replaced shall be half (1/2) of the inches being removed). 
3.  Featured trees. Featured trees (i.e. all trees greater than 25 inches) shall be replaced with twice the number of inches being removed (i.e. the total number of caliper inches of tree being replaced shall be twice the number of caliper inches being removed). 
4.  Non-protected tree. No mitigation will be required for the removal of any tree that is less than four inches DBH or less than 11 inches DBH for hackberry and cedar trees. In addition, no mitigation shall be required for the removal of Bois d'Arc, willow, cottonwood, locust and Chinaberry trees. 
Table 1: Summary of Mitigation Requirements 
Type of Tree Mitigation Value Mitigation Requirement Example of Mitigation Requirements Primary protected trees 4"-25" 1":1" A 20-inch tree would require 20-inches of mitigation. Secondary protect trees 11"-25" 1":1/2" or 1":0.5" A 20-inch tree would require ten inches of mitigation. Featured trees Greater than 25" 1":2" A 30-inch tree would require 60 inches of mitigation.  
5.  Tree preservation credits. For each saved oak, pecan or elm tree(s) 25 inches DBH or greater the mitigation balance can be reduced on an inch-for-inch basis for up to 20 percent of the total mitigation balance (i.e. total mitigation balance × 20 percent = Total eligible tree preservation credit). 
6.  Mitigation balance. The total mitigation balance (i.e. mitigation balance - tree preservation credits = total mitigation balance) may be satisfied through one or a combination of the following: 
(a)  The developer/property owner can provide the required number of trees-three-inch caliper DBH minimum-on the subject property to offset the total mitigation balance (e.g. if the total mitigation balance is nine inches then three three-inch caliper trees could be planted on-site to satisfy the mitigation requirements). 
(b)  The developer/property owner may petition the parks and recreation department to accept the required number of trees-three-inch caliper DBH minimum-to offset the total mitigation balance (e.g. if the total mitigation balance is nine inches then three three-inch caliper trees could be submitted to the parks and recreation department to satisfy the mitigation requirements). Depending on the number of trees being submitted the director of parks and recreation or his/her designee could require a facilities agreement be approved prior to accepting the trees. 
(c)  Tree preservation credits may be purchased at a rate of $200.00 per inch for up to 20 percent of the total replacement inches (e.g. if total mitigation required was 100 inches the developer/property owner could pay a total of $4,000.00 (i.e. (20% × 100) × $200.00 = $4,000.00) into the city's tree fund; however, the developer/property owner would still be required to satisfy a remaining tree mitigation balance of 80 inches). In addition, if the developer/property owner plants a tree on (i) the property for which the tree preservation credit was assessed or (ii) a location that is mutually agreed upon by the city and the developer/property owner, the developer/property owner shall be eligible for a reduction in the cost of tree preservation credits of up to 50 percent. These funds will be deposited in the city's tree mitigation fund and will be used for planting trees in the city's parks, medians, street rights-of-way, or other similar areas as determined by the parks and recreation department. 
(d)  Trees required by article VIII, landscape standards, of this Unified Development Code shall be permitted to be subtracted from the total mitigation balance if provided on site as part of the required landscaping. 
7.  Alternative tree mitigation settlement agreements. In certain cases, the city council-upon recommendation from the planning and zoning commission-may consider an alternative tree mitigation settlement agreement where, due to hardship, the applicant is unable to meet the requirements of this article or where it is determined that adherence to the tree mitigation requirements will create a hardship for an applicant. These funds will be deposited in the city's tree mitigation fund and will be used for planting trees in the city's parks, medians, street rights-of-way, or other similar areas as determined by the parks and recreation department.

1.  All replacement trees must be maintained in a healthy growing condition for a minimum of two years from the date of planting. 
2.  Replacement trees shall not be planted within an area such that the mature root zone will interfere with underground public utility lines, and/or where the mature canopy of the tree will interfere with overhead utility lines. In addition, no tree shall be planted within five feet of an existing fire hydrant, water line or sewer line. 
3.  Replacement trees shall be selected from the reclamation/tree preservation section of table 1.1: required trees by district contained in appendix F, landscape guidelines and requirements, of the Unified Development Code. 
4.  All replacement trees shall be a minimum of three caliper inches DBH. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 6.2. - Transplanting trees. 
    All trees conforming to the species permitted in the reclamation/tree preservation section of table 1.1: required trees by district contained in appendix F, landscape guidelines and requirements, of the Unified Development Code can be transplanted to meet the replacement requirements and shall be subject to the following planting requirements: 
1.  All trees three-caliper inches DBH through six caliper inches DBH are eligible for transplanting. 
2.  All transplanted trees must survive and be maintained in a healthy condition for a minimum of two years from the date of transplanting. The developer/property owner who received the transplanting credit must replace trees that do not meet these criteria. 
3.  Transplanted protected trees will be listed in the tree survey with the notation that they are being transplanted. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
SECTION 7. - TREE PROTECTION DURING CONSTRUCTION 

Sec. 7.1. - Tree protection. 
1.  Prior to any construction or land development, the developer shall clearly mark all protected and feature trees with an aluminum tag-indicating the trees relationship to the treescape plan-and flag ( i.e. bright fluorescent red vinyl tape ). The red tape should be wrapped around the main trunk of the protected and/or feature tree at a height of approximately five feet so that the tape is clearly visible during construction. In those instances where a protected tree is so close to the construction area that construction equipment could possibly damage the tree, a protective fence shall be required. The protective fence must be maintained during all construction phases until the project is finished. 
2.  The developer or property owner shall be responsible for preserving all protected and feature trees during construction. This includes hiring an arborist, if necessary. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 7.2. - Material and equipment storage. 
    The developer or contractor shall not store any material or equipment under the canopy of any protected or featured tree. During the construction stage of the development no cleaning or storage of equipment or material shall be allowed within the drip line of any tree scheduled to be preserved on an approved treescape plan. Those materials include, but are not limited to, oils, solvents, mortar, asphalt and concrete. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 7.3. - Signs. 
    No signs, wire or other attachments shall be affixed to any tree scheduled to be preserved on an approve treescape plan. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 7.4. - Traffic. 
    No vehicular traffic, construction equipment traffic or parking shall take place within the drip line of any tree unless on existing street pavement. This restriction does not apply to single incident access for purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for routine utility maintenance or emergency restoration of utility service or routine mowing operations. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 7.5. - Grade. 
    No grade change in excess of two inches shall be allowed within the drip line of any protected or featured tree unless adequate construction methods are approved beforehand. If approved, major grade changes (i.e. two inches or greater) within the critical root zone of a protected or featured tree will require additional measures to maintain proper oxygen and water exchange with the roots. Root pruning will be required when disturbance will result in root exposure. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 7.6. - Tree flagging. 
    At the time of submittal of a treescape plan all protected trees or feature trees should be marked with an aluminum tag, which indicates its relationship to the treescape plan, and clearly flagged with bright fluorescent red vinyl tape. The red tape should be wrapped around the main trunk of the protected tree at a height of approximately four feet so that the tape is clearly visible. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 7.7. - Boring. 
    Boring of utilities under protected or feature trees shall be required in those circumstances where it is not possible to trench around the critical root zone of a protected or feature tree. When required, the length of the bore shall be the width of the critical root zone plus two feet on either side of the critical root zone and shall be at a minimum depth of 48 inches. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 7.8. - Damage. 
    Any physical damage to a tree being preserved for a tree credit that is considered to place the survival of the tree in doubt shall be eliminated as a credited tree and will require additional trees to planted in its place at the required ratio. A certified arborist shall be consulted to determine whether physical damage to a tree places the survival of the tree in doubt. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
SECTION 8. - TREE PRUNING 

Sec. 8.1. - General. 
    No protected or featured tree shall be pruned in a manner that would significantly disfigure the tree, or in a manner that would lead to the death of the tree. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 8.2. - Pruning by utility companies. 
    Utility companies may prune trees as necessary to reestablish disrupted service or maintain existing service without obtaining a permit. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 8.3. - Allowed pruning. 
    A protected or featured tree may be pruned in cases where it is necessary to remove branches broken during the course of construction, or where protected or featured trees must be pruned to allow construction of a structure. Pruning should be done in manner that does not significantly disfigure the tree or lead to the death of the tree. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
SECTION 9. - TREE FUND 

Sec. 9.1. - Administration of the tree fund. 
    The city shall administer the tree fund. The funds shall be used to purchase plant material as permitted by this ordinance, install (including the equipment or labor necessary to install the plant materials) and maintain trees on public property including the necessary irrigation equipment, to acquire wooded property that remains in a naturalistic state in perpetuity, to perform and maintain a city wide tree inventory and to educate citizens and developers on the benefits and value of trees. The city council shall have the ability to adopt alternative methods of creating tree credits and methods of distribution of trees and/or funds for purchasing trees. 
    Funds collected as a result of the mitigation of trees may be used to purchase trees, both deciduous and coniferous, any woody type plant or any perennial appropriate for the climatic conditions of the north Texas region. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Sec. 9.2. - Collection of money for the tree fund. 
    Money contributed to the tree fund shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit and/or prior to the filing of a final plat. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
SECTION 10. - VIOLATIONS 
    Any person, firm, corporation, agent or employee thereof who violates any of the provisions of this article shall be fined $500.00 for each offense. The unlawful damage, destruction or removal of each tree shall be considered a separate incident and each offence subjects the violator to the maximum penalty of $500.00 for the first tree with each subsequent tree increasing by $500.00 increments. 
    No acceptance of public improvements shall be authorized and no certificates of occupancy (CO) shall be issued until all fines for violations of this article have been paid to the city. 
(Ord. No. 18-01, § 1, 1-2-2018) 
Article X - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS 
SECTION 1. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT-GENERAL 

Sec. 1.1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide for the creation of planned development zoning districts ("PD Districts"). PD Districts are intended to provide for the development of land as an integral unit for single or mixed use in accordance with a PD concept plan that may include uses, regulations and other requirements that vary from this Unified Development Code or from other ordinances, rules or regulations of the city. PD Districts are intended to implement the goals and objectives of the city's comprehensive plan, but may be accompanied by specific amendments to provisions of the comprehensive plan, the parks and open space plan or the thoroughfare plan. PD Districts are also intended to encourage flexible and creative planning, to ensure the compatibility of land uses, and to allow for the adjustment of changing demands to meet the current needs of the community by meeting one or more of the following purposes: 
  To provide for a superior design of lots or buildings; 
  To provide for increased recreation and/or open space opportunities for public use; 
  To provide amenities or features that would be of special benefit to the property users or community; 
  To protect or preserve natural amenities and environmental assets such as trees, creeks, ponds, floodplains, slopes or hills and view corridors; 
  To protect or preserve existing historical buildings, structures, features or places; or 
  To provide an appropriate balance between the intensity of development and the ability to provide adequate supporting public facilities and services. 
(Ord. No. 10-14, § 55, 7-6-2010) 
Sec. 1.2. - Nature of PD districts and minimum standards. 
    Each PD District is intended to be a freestanding zoning district in which land uses and intensities of land use may be tailored to fit the physical features of the site and to achieve compatibility with existing and planned adjacent uses. In order to ensure that a PD District implements the policies of the comprehensive plan, and to further ensure that the PD District is in accordance with a comprehensive plan of zoning regulation, it is necessary to establish minimum standards for residential and nonresidential uses proposed for the PD District that must be incorporated within an ordinance adopted by the council (the "PD ordinance"). 
A.  Land use. 
1.  Uses. Unless otherwise provided by the PD ordinance, only those uses authorized by this Unified Development Code are permitted in PD Districts. 
(Ord. No. 10-14, § 56, 7-6-2010) 
2.  Location. The location of all authorized uses shall be consistent with the PD concept plan and PD site plan. 
B.  Open space standards. 
Public and private open space. Unless otherwise provided by the PD ordinance, a minimum of 20 percent of the gross land area within the entire PD District shall be devoted to open space, except where a floodplain exists in the proposed development in which case the dedicated floodplain shall be allowed to count for up to 50 percent of the 20 percent open space requirement, and shall be consistent with the open space requirements of the city's parks and open space plan. Open space for PD Districts may be satisfied by either public or by a combination of public and private open space. Open space requirements specified in this subsection are in addition to requirements for site landscaping and buffering. Public open space shall be dedicated to the city. 
(Ord. No. 07-18, 6-04-2007) 
1.  Preservation of natural features. Unless otherwise provided by the PD ordinance or PD concept plan: 
a)  Floodplain areas shall be preserved and maintained as open space; and 
b)  Significant stands of native trees and shrubs shall be preserved and protected from destruction or alteration. 
2.  Open space allocation. Open space requirements shall be satisfied for each phase of a multi-phased residential development. If open space is not to be provided proportionally among phases of development, the applicant must execute a reservation of open space in a form that will assure the city that such open space will be provided. The city may require that all open space within the district must be provided prior to completion of development within the district. 
In a residential planned development, all lots less than 12,000 square feet shall be located within 800 feet of a neighborhood-oriented park or open space corridor, which shall be landscaped and serve as a visual amenity and/or gathering place for socializing with neighbors. 
(Ord. No. 07-18, 6-04-2007) 
C.  Other minimum development standards. 
1.  Dimensional and area standards. Unless otherwise provided by the PD ordinance, dimensional and area standards for uses shall be the most restrictive standards authorized by this Unified Development Code for the same or similar uses. 
(Ord. No. 10-14, § 57, 7-6-2010) 
2.  Density standards for residential use. Unless otherwise provided by the PD ordinance, a residential planned development shall allow for a density greater than one unit per gross acre and up to two units per gross acre with a mixture of uses and residential unit size with no minimum lot size. The planned development zoning may be allowed based on the following: 
  Topographic conditions that will result in quality open space and building arrangements. 
  Mix of unit types to accommodate elements of "life-cycle" housing. 
  Amount and distribution of open space to enhance value-creation. 
  The overall master plan and arrangement of buildings and uses. 
  The property should be 50 acres or more in size to adequately accommodate the transition to surrounding development. 
Additionally, in a residential planned development, a density up to 2.5 units per gross acre may be allowed with the dedication and/or development of additional amenities that would exceed the minimum standards for residential planned developments which could include: 
  Parks and open space. 
  Golf course. 
  Neighborhood amenity/recreation center. 
  Integration of schools into the community fabric. 
  Development of trails and parks in floodplains. 
  Development of municipal parks and recreation facilities. 
3.  Anti-monotony standards for residential use. 
a)  Exterior wall materials must comply with section 3.1, General Residential District Standards, of article V of this [Unified Development] Code. Additionally, masonry chimneys shall be required on all homes. 
b)  Front elevations shall not repeat along any block face without at least four intervening homes of differing appearance on the same side of the street and two intervening homes of differing appearance on the opposite side of the street. The rear elevation of homes backing to open spaces or thoroughfares shall not repeat without at least two intervening homes of differing appearance. Identical brick blends may not occur on adjacent (side by side) properties. Homes may differ in appearance in any two of the following ways: 
  Number of stories. 
  Garage location. 
  Roof type and layout. 
  Articulation of the front facade. 
4.  Fencing standards. 
a)  Solid fencing shall be cedar standard fencing material (minimum one-half-inch thickness or more). Spruce fencing will not be allowed. All cedar pickets shall be placed on the "public side" facing a street or an alley. All posts and framing shall be placed on the "private side" of the fence. Other types of solid fencing (such as vinyl) may be considered on a case-by-case basis during the review of the PD development plan. 
b)  Tubular steel or wrought-iron type fencing shall also be allowed. 
c)  Tubular steel or wrought-iron type fencing shall be required on all lots located adjacent to perimeter roadways, open spaces, greenbelts and parks. 
d)  Split rail fencing shall be allowed on lots containing 20,000 square feet or more. 
e)  Fencing on corner lots constructed adjacent to the street shall provide masonry columns at 45 feet off-center spacing that begins at the rear property lien corner and terminates at least 15 feet behind the front yard building setback line. A maximum six-foot-high, solid board-on-board "panel" cedar fencing or wrought iron-type fencing shall be allowed between the masonry columns along the side and/or rear yard adjacent to a street. 
  On corner lots which have rear lot liens adjacent to alleys or other rear lot lines, fences may be constructed along the side yard adjacent to the street, subject to a minimum five feet setback from the right-of-way. The property owner shall maintain that portion of the property outside of the fence. 
  On corner lots which have rear lot lines adjacent to a side lot line of an adjoining lot(s), only tubular steel or wrought iron-type fences not exceeding 42 inches in height may be constructed beyond the building line. Fences constructed on or behind the building line shall comply with the materials requirement in section 4.e above. 
f)  All common areas and perimeter fencing shall be maintained by a homeowners association as specified in the city's subdivision regulations. Perimeter fencing shall be constructed of six-foot-tall tubular steel or wrought iron type fencing with masonry columns and entry features. The planning and zoning commission may consider alternative perimeter screening such as earthen berms with landscaping during the review of the PD development plan. 
(Ord. No. 07-18, 6-04-2007) 
Sec. 1.3. - PD plans required. 
    There are three types of plans that may be required as part of the development process within a PD District. Each successive plan may modify the previous plan provided that it does not substantially change the general intent of the original PD district. Each successive plan becomes part of the zoning ordinance governing the property and replaces the previously approved plan. 
A.  PD concept plan. The PD concept plan is mandatory and is intended to be used as the first step in the PD development process. It establishes the most general guidelines for the PD District by identifying the land uses and intensities, thoroughfare locations, and open space boundaries (including public trail systems). It may include images of intended style and type of development. The concept plan illustrates the integration of these elements into a master plan for the whole PD District. The PD concept plan establishes the development standards for the PD district. 
B.  PD development plan. A PD development plan is optional and is intended to be used where appropriate as the second step of the PD development process. It may be required by the PD ordinance, or it may be submitted voluntarily by the property owner. A PD development plan constitutes an amendment to the approved PD concept plan and PD ordinance and may be used where the developer requests, or the council requires, certain standards for the PD District to be specified after initial establishment of the PD District. A PD development plan includes more detailed information as to the specific development standards and land uses, including their boundaries. The purposes of a PD development plan are to allow flexibility in the development process by deferring specification of all development standards at the time of PD District creation and to enable developers to satisfy conditions imposed on creation of the District prior to submittal of a PD site plan. 
C.  PD site plan. A PD site plan is mandatory and is the final step of the PD development process. The purposes of a PD site plan are to ensure that the development of individual building lots, parcels, or tracts within the PD District are consistent with the approved concept plan and development plan, if any, and to ensure that the standards applicable within the PD District are met for each such lot, parcel or tract. A PD site plan shall continue to be valid for a period of two years after it is approved by the commission; however, such period may be extended by the council upon recommendation of the planning commission. 
1.  The site plan shall be accompanied by building elevations and landscape and master sign plans, which shall be reviewed by the architectural review board for consistency with the overall objectives of the district. The board's recommendation shall be forwarded to the planning and zoning commission for consideration in their recommendation to city council, if applicable. 
2.  A PD site plan shall terminate at the end of a two-year period (or more with an extension approved by the city council) unless, within such period, a preliminary or master plat as required by the city's subdivision ordinance has been filed with the city for all of the land covered by the PD site plan. In which case, the site plan will remain valid as long as there is an approved plat for the property. If a PD site plan terminates, development of the land covered by the terminated plan cannot occur until a new PD site plan has been approved for the land as provided by this article. 
(Ord. No. 06-14, 4-17-2006) 
Sec. 1.4. - PD compliance with approved plans. 
    Except as otherwise provided by the subdivision provisions of this Unified Development Code, no development shall begin and no building permit shall be issued for any land within a PD District until a PD site plan that is consistent with the PD concept plan and applicable PD development plan has been approved. Each PD District shall be developed, used, and maintained in compliance with the approved PD site plans for the district. Compliance with the PD ordinance shall be construed as a condition precedent to granting of certificates of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 10-14, § 58, 7-6-2010) 
SECTION 2. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES 

Sec. 2.1. - Establishment of a PD District. 
A.  Zoning amendment. An application for the establishment of a PD District shall be made to the [planning and zoning] commission. The application shall: 
1.  Be accompanied by a PD concept plan; 
2.  Be accompanied by a list of proposed PD District development standards; 
3.  Identify the city's then-current zoning district which shall apply to the extent not otherwise provided by the PD concept plan or by the proposed PD District development standards; 
4.  Be accompanied by a concept plan informational statement, and traffic impact analysis unless waived by the council. 
Except to the extent provided by the PD concept plan and the PD ordinance, development within the PD District shall be governed by all of the ordinances, rules, and regulations of the city in effect at the time of such development (including the standards of the city's zoning district so identified in the application). In the event of any conflict between: 
(i)  The PD concept plan and the PD ordinance; and 
(ii)  The then-current ordinances, rules, and regulations of the city; 
the terms, provisions, and intent of the PD concept plan and PD ordinance shall control. In addition, prior to action by the commission on the establishment of the PD District, the applicant shall submit a traffic impact analysis. 
B.  PD concept plan. A PD concept plan (or, at the applicant's option, a PD development plan) shall be processed simultaneously with the zoning amendment application, and if the zoning amendment application is approved, the PD concept plan (or PD development plan) shall be incorporated as part of the PD ordinance. The graphic depictions contained on a PD concept plan shall be considered as regulatory standards. Each PD concept plan shall be prepared on one or more standard sheets of sizes of 30 inches by 42 inches or 24 inches by 36 inches and at an engineering scale of one inch equals 100 feet or larger. If multiple sheets are required, an overall plan shall be submitted as well (which may be to any scale). Unless waived by the council on recommendation of the zoning administrator, each PD concept plan shall graphically depict the following: 
1.  A diagram or drawing of the boundaries of the proposed PD District; 
2.  Proposed and existing land uses by category (including, if applicable, proposed and existing land uses by category for any sub-areas to be developed within the PD District); 
3.  Proposed density by type of residential uses, including the maximum numbers of dwelling units for residential uses other than single-family detached, and lot sizes for single-family detached; 
4.  Proposed estimated total floor area and floor area ratios by category of nonresidential uses, together with residential view analysis, if any; 
5.  Proposed configuration of public and private open space serving the development, showing the relationship to the city's parks and open space plan, including trail system and access points to the trail system, estimated dimensions and approximate area, and areas to be dedicated to the public or to a private maintenance organization, if known; 
6.  Proposed and existing thoroughfares, boulevards and roadways; 
7.  To the extent known for adjoining land, existing land uses (by zoning district), existing thoroughfares; and existing open space for such adjoining land; and 
8.  A general plan for circulation of traffic and pedestrians within and external to the development, including designated points of access. 
C.  Concept plan informational statement. A PD concept plan shall be accompanied by an informational statement containing the information set forth below. If the zoning amendment application is approved, the informational statement shall not be binding on the applicant or the land owner and shall not be considered part of the PD concept plan or the PD ordinance. Informational statements shall be updated concurrently with any amendment to the PD concept plan and with each PD development plan. Each statement shall include the following: 
1.  A general statement setting forth how the proposed PD District will relate to the city's comprehensive plan; 
2.  The total acreage within the proposed PD District; 
3.  If the development is to occur in phases, a conceptual phasing plan that identifies the currently anticipated general sequence of development, including the currently anticipated general sequence for installation of major capital improvements to serve the development; and 
4.  An aerial photograph with the boundaries of the PD concept plan clearly delineated. 
D.  Proposed PD development standards. Proposed PD District development standards shall be processed simultaneously with the zoning amendment application, and if the zoning amendment application is approved, such standards shall be incorporated as part of the PD ordinance. Such proposed development standards may include (but shall not be limited to) uses; density; lot size; lot dimensions; setbacks; coverage; height; landscaping; lighting, fencing, parking and loading; signage; open space; drainage; and utility and street standards. Any graphic depictions used to illustrate such standards, unless otherwise provided in the PD ordinance, shall be considered as regulatory standards. 
E.  Traffic impact analysis. Prior to or simultaneous with submission of an application for the establishment of a PD District, the applicant shall submit to the city's transportation engineer a traffic impact analysis for the proposed PD District, unless waived by council. The analysis must be approved by the council prior to or concurrently with the approval by the council of the PD District. The traffic analysis shall not be considered part of the PD concept plan or the PD ordinance but may be used to condition the density or intensity of uses or the timing of development within the district based upon the existence of a supporting roadway network adequate to accommodate the traffic expected to be generated. The traffic impact analysis shall be updated with each PD site plan. 
F.  Complete application. No application for the establishment of a PD District shall be deemed to be filed with the city until the zoning administrator has determined that the PD concept plan is complete, that the proposed PD District development standards have been identified, a traffic impact analysis has been submitted, and that the informational statement is complete. Fifteen copies of all such materials shall be submitted. 
G.  Commission recommendation. The commission, after notice and public hearing in accordance with this Unified Development Code procedures, shall formulate its recommendation with respect to establishment of a PD District. The recommendation of the commission shall be forwarded to the council for decision. 
(Ord. No. 10-14, § 59, 7-6-2010) 
H.  Council decision. Following receipt of the commission's recommendation, the council, after notice and public hearing in accordance with this [Unified Development Code] procedures, shall conduct a public hearing and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application for establishment of the PD District. 
I.  Approval criteria. Based upon the PD concept plan, the commission, in making its recommendations to the council, and the council, in determining whether the PD District should be established, shall consider whether the following criteria have been met: 
1.  The plan of development is generally consistent with the city's comprehensive plan (as such plan may be amended prior to or concurrently with approval of the PD District); 
2.  Proposed uses and the configuration of uses are compatible with existing and planned adjoining uses; 
3.  The general arrangement of streets conforms to the city's thoroughfare plan (as such plan may be amended prior to or concurrently with approval of the PD District); 
4.  Proposed uses, development densities and intensities, and development regulations are generally consistent with this article; 
5.  The configuration of the proposed open space serving the development is consistent with the city's parks and open space plan (as such plan may be amended prior to or concurrently with approval of the PD District); 
6.  The amenities proposed justify proposed densities or intensities; 
7.  The proposed plan of development furthers the public health, safety and general welfare of the community; and 
8.  The traffic impact analysis demonstrates that the capacity of the proposed roadways shown on the proposed PD concept plan, together with any roadways within related PD Districts and the supporting roadway network, are adequate to accommodate the traffic expected to be generated by the uses, densities and intensities of use shown on the PD concept plan in and authorized in the PD ordinance in a timely and efficient manner. 
J.  Conditions. The commission may recommend, and the council may require, such conditions to the establishment of a PD District and to the approval of a PD concept plan as are reasonably necessary to ensure that the purposes of the district and the approval criteria for the PD concept plan are met. Such conditions may include the requirement of a PD development plan. 
K.  Adopting ordinance. The PD ordinance shall include the PD concept plan as an exhibit to [this article] and shall include the following: 
1.  A statement of the purpose and intent of the PD District;

Sec. 2.2. - PD development plans. 
    If the council requires as a condition of establishing the PD District and approving a PD concept plan that PD development plans be submitted prior to submittal of a PD site plan, a PD development plan may be prepared and submitted for the entire development at one time or for individual phases of development. Each required copy of the PD development plan shall be accompanied by (i) a development plan informational statement and (ii) a preliminary drainage study for the area covered by the proposed plan. If deemed necessary by the city's transportation engineer or zoning administrator, the applicant for a PD development plan shall also submit an updated traffic impact analysis prior to commission action.

12.  A list identifying each proposed addition or amendment to the PD ordinance. 
D.  Preliminary drainage study. Each PD development plan shall be accompanied by a preliminary drainage study for the area covered by the study. The study shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Texas and experienced in the study of drainage issues. 
1.  Purpose. The purposes of the drainage design policies are to prevent flooding of adjacent properties, owned by third parties and to regulate water surface elevations and peak discharges. Development within the PD District shall not produce any increase in the water surface elevation (either upstream or downstream) due to a five-year, ten-year, 50-year, or 100-year storm. If the discharge from the area proposed for development would increase the water surface elevation above predevelopment conditions on any property owned by third parties due to any of such storms, then such peak discharge must be regulated to the extent necessary to eliminate the increased water surface elevation. The regulation of discharges to eliminate such increases may be achieved using either on-site or off-site stormwater management facilities (such as detention areas, retention areas, and infiltration and sedimentation ponds). 
2.  Content. The preliminary drainage study shall: 
a)  Contain a topographical map of the area proposed for development to a scale not smaller than one inch equals 200 feet; 
b)  Generally describe how the proposed development will comply with the drainage design policies set forth below; 
c)  Include all information deemed necessary by the preparing engineer to support his determination that the proposed development will comply with the drainage design policies; and 
d)  Include all information reasonably requested by the city engineer to support his review of the preliminary drainage study. 
E.  Updated traffic impact analysis. If deemed necessary by the city's transportation engineer or if required by the PD ordinance, the applicant for a proposed PD development plan shall submit an updated traffic impact analysis prior to action by the commission. The purpose of the updated analysis is to determine whether the traffic estimated to be generated by the development shown on the proposed PD development plan will necessitate specific on-site or adjacent traffic improvements (e.g., turn lanes, stacking lanes, signalization, etc.) and to determine whether conditions attached to the concept plan based on the original traffic impact analysis have been met. 
F.  Commission recommendation. The commission, after notice and public hearing in accordance with this Unified Development Code procedures, shall recommend to the council whether to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove each PD development plan, together with each proposed amendments to the PD ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 10-14, § 60, 7-6-2010) 
G.  Council decision.

Sec. 2.4. - Amendment of PD Plans. 
A.  PD concept plans. PD concept plans (excluding informational statements) are considered part of the PD ordinance. Any amendment to a PD concept plan shall be considered a zoning change, and the provisions of V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 211 relating to notices, public hearings, and written protests for changes in zoning districts or regulations shall apply. If a PD District is established subject to approval of PD development plans, the provisions of this subsection 2.4.A shall apply to such PD development plan. 
B.  PD site plans. PD site plans are not considered part of a PD ordinance. Except as otherwise provided, any amendment to an approved PD site plan must be approved by the commission. However, "minor modifications" to any PD site plan may be approved by the zoning administrator. If the zoning administrator believes that a request for minor modification entails a significant change in the site plan, he may refer the request to the commission for determination. A "minor modification" to a PD site plan is defined as any modification that does not: 
1.  Alter the basic relationship of proposed development to adjacent property; 
2.  Change the uses permitted; 
3.  Increase the maximum density, floor area, or height; 
4.  Decrease the amount of off-street parking, unless parking remains sufficient in number and conforms to [article] requirements; or 
5.  Reduce the minimum yards or setbacks. 
Sec. 2.5. - Periodic review. 
A.  Applicability. Each tract of land not yet fully developed, for which (PD) Planned Development District zoning has been granted, shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission in order to make inquiry and ascertain the following: 
1.  Whether a preliminary plan and/or development plan can reasonably be expected to be filed; 
2.  If a preliminary plan and/or development plan can be reasonably expected to be filed at any time within the two-year interval as set out herein; 
3.  Whether the granted uses for the tract of land under consideration continues to have a desired relationship with the surrounding area; and 
4.  If such density and other design standards originally granted are in accordance with the current community growth patterns and values. 
B.  Determination. If, upon inquiry and review, the planning and zoning commission finds that a particular tract of land zoned (PD) Planned Development is not reflective of current community growth patterns or community design policies, or is not in accordance with the comprehensive plan, it may request the city council to initiate hearings on the particular tract of land to consider: 
1.  Reform or modification of the PD District on the particular tract; or 
2.  Change the zoning to a more suitable land use classification. 
C.  Frequency. The planning and zoning commission shall review each tract of land for which Planned Development zoning has been granted beginning in January of each year, at least on two year intervals. The planning and zoning commission may review certain tracts (for which Planned Development zoning has been granted) more frequently if it determines such review is necessary.

Sec. 2.5. - Effect of site plan approval. 
A.  Site plan expiration. If development of a lot or tract with an approved site plan has not been completed within two years, or more with an extension, of its final approval, the site plan shall be deemed to have expired and a new review and approval of a site plan for development of the property shall be undertaken, and this new approval shall be required before a building permit is issued for development. This review and approval shall be evaluated according to the standards of this [Unified Development Code], taking into account all changes to this [Unified Development Code] which have occurred subsequent to the prior site plan approval. 
B.  Phasing plan expiration. If the site plan is submitted in conjunction with an approved phasing plan for development of the lot or tract, the site plan shall be deemed to have expired if any phase is not completed within the time period approved for such phase. No site plan phase may be planned to exceed three years unless specifically authorized by the planning and zoning commission and city council when demonstrated that due to the size or complexity of the site the three-year time period would create a hardship. If any phase is not completed within the time period approved, the entire remaining uncompleted site plan shall be deemed to have expired and the provisions of subsection A above shall be followed. 
C.  Extension of site plan. Extension of an approved site plan may be granted by the planning and zoning commission and city council upon submission of a request for such extension by the property owner at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the plan. The planning and zoning commission and city council shall take into consideration any changes that have occurred in this [Unified Development Code] subsequent to original approval of the plan and the property owner may be required to bring such plan into compliance with the current requirements. The period of time approved for any such extension shall be indicated in any approval, but in no case, shall the period for extension exceed three years. 
Sec. 2.6. - Amendment of site plans.

Appendix D - HISTORIC PRESERVATION GUIDELINES 
INTRODUCTION 
    These guidelines have been compiled for the residents and property owners of City of Rockwall designated historic properties located within the Old Town Rockwall Historic District. The preservation, rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of old buildings contribute to the community aesthetically and economically. Rehabilitation is often less expensive than demolition or new construction. This guide was created to aid property owners in rehabilitating and maintaining their property in order to assist the City of Rockwall and the Old Town Rockwall residents in their effort of "preserving the past for the future." 
CITY OF ROCKWALL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ADVISORY BOARD 
    The City of Rockwall historic preservation advisory board was created June 17, 1991 (Ord. No. 91-25, section 2.20.C.2. and Ord. No. 92-25), to serve as an advisory body to the city council. The seven members of the board are appointed for a term of two years by the city council. Functions of the advisory board include maintaining the Historic District register and reviewing applications for construction, alteration, removal, or demolition affecting proposed or designated Historic District properties, and approving or denying certificates of appropriateness. 
PURPOSE 
    The city council of the City of Rockwall, Texas, declared that as a matter of public policy the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of districts of historical and cultural importance and significance is necessary to promote the economic, cultural, educational and general welfare of the public. It is recognized that numerous areas, sites and structures within the City of Rockwall represent the distinguishing characteristics of a period style or method of construction that shaped the identity of generations of citizens, collectively and individually, and produced significant historic, architectural and cultural resources that constitute their heritage. Therefore, this policy is intended to: 
1.  Protect, identify and enhance distinctive historical and architectural characteristics and landmarks, which represent distinctive cultural, social, economic, political, and architectural history of Rockwall; 
2.  Foster civic pride in the accomplishments of the past; 
3.  Protect and enhance Rockwall's attractiveness to visitors and the support and stimulus to the economy thereby provided; 
4.  Ensure the harmonious, orderly and efficient growth and development of the city; 
5.  Promote economic prosperity and welfare of the community by encouraging the most appropriate use of such property within the city; 
6.  Stabilize and improve values of such properties; 
7.  Promote education of significance and importance of historical preservation including the exploration of tax incentives (federal, state or local) that may apply to individual property owners or properties within the Historic District as a whole; and 
8.  Provide guidance to property owners restoring and/or rehabilitating historic significant properties with discretion and flexibility in an effort to maintain the historical integrity of the area with a corresponding understanding of the economic realities of these types of restorative efforts. 
Applicable Property/Structure Flowchart 

DEFINITIONS

    Contributing structure means a building, site, structure or object which adds to the historical architectural qualities, historical associations or archaeological value for which a property or district is significant because it was present during the period of significance. It also possesses historical integrity reflecting its character at that time or is capable of yielding important information about the period, or it independently meets the National Register criteria. The level by which a property is "contributing" (high-, medium- and low-contributing property) was originally determined by a historic survey of the properties within the (HO) Historic Overlay District implemented by the City of Rockwall community development department through the spring and summer of 2000.

Some information in the guidelines repeats material that is available elsewhere and restates information, requirements and standards that are found in ordinances and code[s]. 
I. - IMPLEMENTATION 
    These guidelines provide the general standards for acceptable physical characteristics of each building or structure and site, and any modifications thereto within the Old Town Rockwall Historic District). The goal is to achieve maximum adherence to the guidelines with a minimum of delay or confusion to designated Historic District property owners. 
    The guidelines are designed to provide as much flexibility as possible while continuing to promote the objectives set forth in the [Unified Development Code]. 
A.  A committee of the Old Town Rockwall Historic District residents is available to serve in an advisory role for individual projects in the district. The Old Town Rockwall historic district committee is established as a standing committee of the Rockwall historic preservation advisory board. The Old Town Rockwall historic district committee will also be available to assist the board at their request. 
B.  The "contributing" historic structures and "non-contributing" properties within the designated Historic District are listed in appendix A. 
C.  Historic properties 50 years of age or older are deemed to have acquired historical significance in their own right and are eligible to be included in the Old Town Rockwall historic district registry. Nomination applications may be obtained from the department of community development. Completed forms should be submitted to the historic preservation advisory board for Historic District designation approval. Forms delivered to the historic preservation officer will be forwarded to the board chairman. 
II. - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
A.  The development standards in the City of Rockwall building codes shall apply to all "applicable properties" within the district as shown on the map in appendix B. 
B.  All city ordinances, building codes must be followed, including the landscape ordinance, the lighting and landscape ordinances for commercial development. In addition, these guidelines will serve as reference material to ensure the approval of a certificate of appropriateness. In the event of a conflict or absent a specific directive in these guidelines, the provisions determined by the historic preservation advisory board to be historically beneficial shall control. 
III. - BUILDING STANDARDS 
    New additions to existing buildings or structures, including the construction of an additional freestanding building or structure on a lot, or new construction which utilizes existing party walls, should be accomplished as outlined in these guidelines if the definition of an "applicable property" is met. 
    For new construction on any vacant lot, the scale, mass, volume, period and style shall be compatible with other historic buildings or structures in the Historic District. 
A.  Height. All new buildings and additions shall be constructed to a height and number of stories which are consistent and compatible with existing neighboring historic buildings or structures on the same block face. 
B.  Building setback and orientation. 
1.  All new additions, alterations, infill and new infill construction should recognize and maintain the established historic home site orientation, and side and front side setbacks within the block face, thereby being visually compatible and maintaining the established rhythm and setback spacing. 
2.  Consideration will be given to the historic precedence for previous site configuration. Out buildings such as garages and storage buildings are historically set upon the lot line in this district, therefore this configuration is proper. 
3.  New structures should be built to maintain an elevation with a "pier-and-beam" appearance. 
4.  A new commercial structure should not be oriented toward a residential block face. Residential block for new construction is defined as a block face having at least 50 percent residential use at the time the new structure is proposed. 
C.  Building facades and materials. In cases where the original exterior facade materials are unavailable, complementary exterior materials may be used. 
1.  All exterior wood and masonry materials and their use should be compatible to the style and period of the building or structure. 
2.  The existing building facade materials on a building should be respected and not be changed or concealed by the introduction of a different material. 
3.  When the existing facade materials are not the original type, then materials may be replaced with, or returned to the original type. 
4.  Exterior building columns should be of a style and materials typical of the period and style of the building. 
5.  All new chimneys should be of a style, proportion and materials compatible with the period and style of the building. Any new construction or additions should not conceal or destroy existing chimneys. 
6.  Materials, structural and decorative elements and the manner in which they are used, applied or joined together should be typical of the style and period of the existing structure. New additions, alterations and new construction should be visually compatible with neighboring historic buildings or structures. 
7.  The overall relationship of the size, width, height and number of doors and windows on the exterior building facades should be typical of the style and period of the structure. These elements should be proportionally balanced, sized and located in a manner typical of the style and period of the structure and compatible with neighboring historic buildings or structures. 
8.  Storm doors and storm windows are permitted so long as they do not damage or conceal significant features and are visually compatible in size, style and color with the structure. Finishes or should be consistent with the historical materials of the property. 
9.  Metal and corrugated or slatted plastic awnings are not permitted except where these awnings are a historical feature of the property. The shape, size and color of awnings shall be compatible with the structure and not conceal or damage any significant architectural details. 
D.  Roofs. 
1.  Roof shape, form and design should be typical of or consistent with the style and period of the architecture of buildings within the Historic District. 
2.  The accepted roof overhang for a new structure should be typical of a structure of similar style and period. Replacement, addition or alteration to an existing roof should have the same overhang as the existing roof. 
3.  The eaves or soffit heights of a structure should be consistent with the heights of neighboring contributing structures or with those in the closest block face with buildings of a similar period and style and the same number of stories.

6.  Mechanical equipment placed on the roof should not to be visible from the street. 
E.  Front yards. 
1.  The front yard is defined as a yard across the full width of a lot extending from the front line of the main building to the front street line of the lot. 
2.  Generally, the use of the front yard will be reserved for landscaping with the purpose of enhancing the structures on the lot with plant material. 
3.  Any paving in the front yard should be consistent with the historic character of the property or nearby contributing properties. As a general rule, the following standards will be followed: 
a.  A paved walkway from the front lot line to the front or, on a corner lot, from the side lot line to a side entry of the structure. In all cases, the walkway should not be wider than the entry steps and in no instance should the walkway be wider than ten feet. 
b.  A paved walkway is allowed from the driveway to the front and/or side entry walkway, with a maximum width of three feet.

These structures should reflect the character of the existing residence and be compatible in terms of scale, height, size, roof shape, materials and detailing. 
3.  Consideration should be given to the historic precedence for previous site configuration. Outbuildings such as garages and storage buildings are historically set upon the lot line in this Historic District. This configuration is proper for new additions, alterations, infill and new infill construction. The location of these buildings should be sensitive to the character, site and environment of any adjacent contributing structures, especially when the rear yard is on a corner lot visible from street public rights-of-way. 
H.  Fences. A fence in the front, side, or rear yards should meet all applicable city codes. Most fences require only a fence permit; however, a fence requiring a building permit will also be reviewed and approved by the board. Any fence that requires review must be architecturally compatible in height, materials, color, texture and design with the style and period of the main structure on the lot. 
I.  Driveways. 
1.  The purpose of the driveway shall be to create a paved surface for the movement of vehicles to parking areas. The driveway is defined as the paved area within the property line extending from the back of the sidewalk or lot line to the garage, out building or porte cochere. 
2.  The driveway should not exceed a width of ten feet. 
3.  The driveway may extend along the side of the residence or structure, through the porte cochere (if applicable) to the to the rear yard.

M.  Paint and color. 
1.  Brick, stone or other naturally or historically unpainted materials should not be painted unless the material has been painted before. 
2.  Florescent and metallic colors are not recommended on the exterior of any structure. Paint does not require a building permit and therefore is not subject to board review. Appropriate colors complimentary to the style and period of the structure and to neighboring historic structures are preferred; however, specific approval of paint colors is not required. 
3.  For new commercial construction and for additions requiring site plan approval, finishes and color may be a part of the review. 
N.  Signage, generally. 
1.  An unlighted sign with the address or name of the occupant of the residence may be attached or detached and should not measure more than one square foot.

An awning or canopy should be subjected to the same requirements as an attached sign. An awning or canopy and an attached sign combined should not exceed the total area permitted for a wall sign. 
b.  Projecting signs should not extend higher than the bottom of the second story windows or not less than 11 feet above grade level. Projecting signs should not extend more than two feet beyond the building surface. 
5.  Lighted signs will receive approval from the City of Rockwall historic preservation advisory board on a case-by-case basis. 
6.  Roof top signs are not permitted. Banners signs are permitted for 30 days and "special event" banners are allowed for two weeks. The City of Rockwall sign ordinance requires permits for banners.

The maximum size is 16 square feet and it should not impede pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic. Monument signs should not be permitted. Detached signs will be approved the City of Rockwall historic preservation advisory board on a case-by-case basis. 
IV. - MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS 
    Nothing in these guidelines should be construed to prevent routine maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature of a property. Repairs should be made in accordance with these guidelines. 
    The historic preservation officer will answer inquiries as to what is "routine maintenance" where no certificate of appropriateness is required. Examples of routine maintenance include, but are not limited to, touch-up painting, spot replacement of shingles, or replacement of a pane of glass. If there is doubt that an activity is "routine maintenance," the historic preservation officer should be consulted. 
V. - RELOCATION CRITERIA 
A.  Structure relocated within the district should be rebuilt in compliance with these guidelines and retain and maintain the original architectural details, materials, design and character. 
B.  A structure may be relocated into the Historic District if it possesses architectural character similar to existing historic structures on the block face. 
C.  A structure may be moved from one site to another in the Historic District if: 
1.  The integrity of location and setting of the building in its original location has been lost or is seriously threatened; 
2.  The new location will be similar in setting and siting; 
3.  The structure will be compatible with the buildings adjacent to the new location; and 
4.  The relocation of the building will not result in a negative visual impact on the site and any surrounding historic structures in the area from which it will be removed. 
VI. - DEMOLITION CRITERIA 
    Demolition of a structure which contributes historically or architecturally to the Historic District should be prohibited, except as provided below. Demolition of a structure would be allowed if: 
1.  The building has lost its architectural and historical integrity and importance, and its removal will not result in a negative, less appropriate visual effect on the Historic District; or 
2.  A structure does not contribute to the historical or architectural character and importance of the Historic District (such as a non-contributing structure), and its removal will result in a positive, appropriate visual effect on the Historic District; or 
3.  There is an imminent threat to the health, safety and welfare to the surrounding residents and/or property because of an unsafe condition that constitutes an emergency (see section VII, Demolition-by-Neglect). 
VII. - DEMOLITION-BY-NEGLECT 
    Although the property maintenance code should prevent this situation from occurring in the future, there may be some properties to which this section could apply. 
A.  Definition. Demolition-by-neglect is the absence of maintenance of any structure that results in the deterioration and threatens the preservation of the structure. 
B.  Purpose. The demolition-by-neglect procedure serves as a mechanism that allows the city staff and the historic preservation advisory board to work with property owners to encourage maintenance and stabilization of the structure and identify possible resources available before any enforcement is taken. 
C.  Request for investigation. Any interested party may request that the historic preservation officer or appropriate city investigate whether a property is being "demolished-by-neglect." 
D.  Certification and notice. Following the investigation, a report will be made detailing the issues and a determination made whether to follow steps required to secure a "certificate of appropriateness" or to follow the procedure under the property maintenance code. 
VIII. - HISTORIC TREES 
    In addition to the protection offered our trees through the City of Rockwall tree preservation ordinance, individual trees located on an historic property which are considered historic landmarks in our community may be registered as "historic trees." The registry application in exhibit 1 [attached to the ordinance from which this appendix is derived] should be completed and submitted to the historic preservation officer to forward to the board chairman. 
    A registered tree will not be removed under any circumstances unless the tree becomes unhealthy or damaged. The "historic trees" will be listed within an appendix C to be attached to these guidelines. 
Appendix E - SCENIC OVERLAY (FM 740) DESIGN GUIDELINES
