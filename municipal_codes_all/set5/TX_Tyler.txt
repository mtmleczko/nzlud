PREFACE
This Code is a codification of the ordinances of the City of Tyler of a general
and permanent nature. As expressed in the original Adopting Ordinance, the Code
supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing
in force by reference thereto.
The chapters of the Code are arranged in an order suggested by responsibilities
within the City organization and grouped with departments that have
responsibility for that section of the code and the sections within each
chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage.  Footnotes which tie related
sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the
state law have been included.  The source of each section is indicated by the
history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof.  The absence of such
a note indicates that the section was adopted in 1978 at the time of a prior
codification.  By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of
the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Citations to "Texas law" refer to Vernon's Annotated Civil Statutes, unless
otherwise described.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state
and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts
separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number
and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the
chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the seventh
section of Chapter 6 is 6-7. Under this system each section is identified with
its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be
inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for
amendments. By way of illustration:  If new material consisting of three
sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to
be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3 respectively.
New chapters may be included by the addition of a decimal after the chapter
number; e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 6 and 7 it
will be designated as Chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles
and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles,
may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case
of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject,
the next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
Index
Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the
headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and
still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees.
There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as
guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and
supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically.
Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited
and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be
distributed to the holders of the Code by the City Attorney's office who will
insert the new pages and delete the obsolete pages.  A new feature is that this
Code is now available on computer disk.  As changes are made, the City
Attorney's office will make those changes available to "computer users" by
removing their old Code and reinstalling a new current Code.
The object of this recodification and changed supplement method is to ensure
that every copy of the Code is kept current at all times.
Acknowledgments
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of the City
Attorney's office.
The City Attorney's office is most grateful to all city officers and employees
for their supervision, cooperation and interest during the preparation of this
Code. Special acknowledgment is made to Connie Land, Legal Assistant; Steven M.
Kean, Assistant City Attorney;  Ann Lanier, City Clerk; Pinkney L. Butler,
Assistant City Manager; and Ernest R. Clark, City Manager for their efforts and
assistance.

APPROVED:
/s/ Gary C. Landers______________
CITY ATTORNEY
DATE:      February 20, 1995
TO:      Persons Interested in Tyler City Code
FROM:   Gary Landers, City Attorney
SUBJECT:   Reorganization of City Code
*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
EXPLANATION
On February 15, 1995, the Tyler City Council approved Ordinance No. O-95-
7 which completely reorganized the Code, changing it from 31 chapters and three
(3) appendices into 20 chapters.  The old Code was organized under a
traditional approach which grouped regulations under related topic headings in
chapters that were in alphabetical order, based upon the name of the topic. 
The reorganized Code tries to, wherever possible, take all regulations that are
administered by the same department and place them in chapters which are more
closely related to the structural organization of the City.  The chapters of
the new Code are then put in an order roughly equalling Administrative Services
Departments, Police, Planning and Neighborhood Services, and Public Services.
The result of the new organization of the Code is that the first three new
chapters named Administration, Finance & Taxation, and Personnel are those
three chapters which apply to all City employees.  Chapter 4, "Offenses and
Miscellaneous Provisions," is still a catch-all chapter that consists mainly of
ordinance regulations that are administered by the Police Department, but may
include other provisions which would not easily fit into another chapter.  The
remaining chapters, some of which have new names, are mostly regrouped and
reorganized so that only that department or those departments that are involved
in using those ordinance regulations would need to be familiar with that
chapter.  Since there is some crossover responsibility within the City, where
the same ordinance may be administered by more than one department, it was
impossible to separate all ordinances into individual "department" chapters. 
However, the majority of the new Code is organized in department specific
chapters.
Although this change, like any change, will initially make it more difficult
for individuals using the code to find a particular section, eventually it
should result in a situation where it is much easier for City user departments
to find and be familiar with their provisions of the Code and for citizens or
other persons unfamiliar with the Code to find the specific sections they are
interested in.  Remember to check all forms and letters because the references
to Code in them wil probably need to be changed.
HOW TO GET "NEW" CODE
The new reorganized Code is to become effective March 1, 1995.  That just means
that the old unusual sized black bound code books will no longer be the City
Code on that date.  The new reorganized code will be available in regular
letter-sized three-ring binders through the three Assistant City Managers and
two Chiefs.  Along with this reorganizing of the Code, the  City Council has
also cancelled the contract the City has had for many years with an outside
codifier company, and it will now become the responsibility of  Legal to
provide in-house supplements for the City Code.  Thus, Legal, along with the
City Clerk and Print Shop, will become responsible for providing the original
copies of the new Code and supplements as changes are made.  The plan is for
Legal to make changes to the Code approved by the City Council within a week
after the Council approves the changes and then bring copies of those changes
(supplements) to each location that has City Codes and will change or
supplement the Codes.  Thus, under this new plan, it will no longer be the
responsibility of each individual department to receive a stack of supplements
and update their own code book.  Instead, Legal will provide this service to
all user departments providing current codes more timely.
Number of Codes and Partial or Entire Codes
An option now available to departments is that each department may choose to
have either a copy of the entire code in their three-ring binder or only those
specific chapters of the Code that that department is involved in regulating. 
Since Chapter 1, "Administration," Chapter 2, "Finance & Taxation," and Chapter
3, "Personnel," apply to all departments, it is expected that all departments
will want a copy of those three chapters in addition to the chapter or chapters
that department administers.  For example, the Police Department might choose
to have a partial code that just includes Chapters 1 -3 , plus Chapters 4 and
17.  The Parks Department might choose to have a partial code that includes
Chapters 1-3 and Chapter 8, "Parks."  After receiving this memo, each
department head or each work- site supervisor that has in the past had a copy
of the City Code or which would like to have a copy of the Code in the future,
should contact their Assistant City Manager or Chief to discuss how many copies
of the code are needed in that department, and whether those copies should be
of the entire Code or excerpts from the Code.  The Assistant City Managers and
Chiefs will then pass this information on to Legal which can then make the
needed copies.  It is expected that these copies will be distributed to
department heads during one of their division meetings where a representative
of Legal  will come and answer questions and distribute copies of the new
reorganized Code.
A one-page chart showing the chapters of the old Code and the chapters of the
new Code and explaining where chapters of the old Code are found in the new
Code is attached for your information.
Code on Computer Disk
Another option that is now available is for a department to choose to have the
Code on a 3 1/2 x 5 computer disk rather than in a hard copy.  A partial code
would be available on one disk, and the entire City Code is available on two
disks.  In order to effectively use the Code on disk, the user department would
also need to buy a site license allowing them to use software called "Folio"
which provides for almost instant access to keywords or regulatory terms in the
Code by means of electronic search.  The site license cost is $25.00.
Recodification
All of the above are steps in an overall project the City Council approved last
fall to completely revise and recodify City ordinances bound in the Code book. 
A more specific memo detailing the recodification process and proposed
timetables will be distributed in a short time. 
Conclusion
The effective date of the new Code will arrive very soon, and thus, it is vital
that each City work site that has a copy of the Code or wants a copy of the
Code get together with their Assistant City Manager or Chief right away and
decide how many  copies and whether they will be partial or entire copies.  The
sooner this information is returned to the City Attorney's Office, the sooner
the new Codes can be distributed.

New Chapter 6 entitled "Building and Structures" is one of two chapters (along
with Chapter 15) which has not had its numbers changed.  That is, Chapter 6 is
still the chapter where uniform building and other code regulations are found. 
The Fire Prevention and Protection regulations have now been moved to Chapter
6, and it is an example of a chapter that is administered by more than one
department, including Fire, Building Inspection, and Neighborhood Services.
New Chapter 8, "Parks," is simply the result of taking old Chapter 18 and
transferring all of its provisions to a new chapter.  New Chapter 9, "Library,"
is the result of taking the regulations relating to the Library Board from old
Chapter 2 and placing them in a new separate department specific chapter.  New
Chapter 10, "Planning and Zoning," is the result of combining several related
regulations, taking the Landscape Ordinance from old Chapter 14, all of old
Chapter 24, "Planning and Zoning," and combining them with old Appendix "A"
Zoning and Appending "B" Subdivisions.  New Chapter 12 is the result of simply
taking all airport-related regulations from old Chapter 5 and moving them to a
new Chapter 12.
New Chapter 14, "Animals," simply takes all provisions from all Chapter 4 and
moves them to this new chapter.  New Chapter 15, "Franchises," is the other
chapter in the reorganized code which was not moved around so that it has
remained unchanged in the way it codifies the cable, electric, gas, and
telephone franchises, but it also has combined with it now the remainder of old
Appendix "C."
New Chapters 16, 17, and 19 are primarily associated with the Public Services
Division Departments.  New Chapter 16 was previously reviewed by the City
Council and created as a separate department specific chapter prior to this
reorganization ordinance.  Chapter 17, "Streets, Sidewalks and Traffic,"
combines provisions from many old chapters including Chapters 26, 29, and 31. 
This chapter is also an example of a set of regulations which are administered
by several departments, and thus it includes regulations that are the
responsibility of the Police, Traffic, Street, and Engineering Departments. 
New Chapter 19, "Utilities," combines old Chapters 21 (lake regulations) with
old Chapter 30 (water utilities regulations).

following the particular sections or subsections amended. For the purposes of
clarity, a uniform style of capitalization has been utilized, catchlines have
changed to more accurately reflect the contents thereof, and words have been
added in brackets where deemed necessary by the editor.

deemed to be exclusive, but, in addition to the powers enumerated herein,
implied thereby or appropriate to the exercise thereof, the City shall have,
and may exercise all other powers which, under the constitution and laws of
Texas, it would be competent for this charter specifically to enumerate. And it
is hereby expressly provided that it shall have all the powers that are granted
to cities of more than five thousand inhabitants by State law regarding home
rule cities, platting and subdividing, zoning, and building lines as the law is
now and as it may be amended. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)

known as, "Council-Manager Government." Pursuant to the provisions of and
subject only to the limitations imposed by the State laws and this Charter, all
powers of the City shall be vested in an elective Council, which shall
hereinafter be referred to in every section of this Charter as the "Council,"
which shall enact legislation, adopt budgets, determine policies, and appoint
the City Manager who shall execute the laws and administer the government of
the City. (Amdt. of 4-1-75; Prop. 1, 5-5-90)

unless sooner removed under the provisions of this Charter and laws of the
State of Texas, for a term of two (2) years or until their successor shall have
been elected or [appointed] and qualified; provided, however, that no person
shall be elected to the Council for terms of office which would cause such
person to serve on the Council in a term beginning after they shall have
completed six (6) consecutive years on such Council. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)
   c. Meetings: There shall be regular public meetings of the Council at such

members of the Council. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)

held in accordance with state law, for the voters to choose between two (2)
candidates receiving the highest number of votes at the prior election. The

Sec. 17. Filling vacancies.
   Vacancies in the council arising from any cause shall be filled for the
remainder of the unexpired term by a special election to be held on the next

Sec. 18. Recall and election to fill vacancy created; authorized; procedure.
   Any councilmember of this City may be recalled and removed from office by
the voters qualified to elect such member. The procedure to remove
Councilmembers shall be as follows:
   a.   A petition signed by qualified voters entitled to vote for a successor
to the councilmember to be removed, equal in number to at least fifteen (15)
per centum of the entire number of persons entitled to vote for such position,
as appears from the appropriate voter registration list, demanding the recall
of said Councilmember, shall be filed with the City Clerk; provided such
petition shall contain a general statement of the grounds for which the removal
is sought. The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to one
paper, but signers shall add to their signatures their places of residence,
giving the street and number. One of the signers to each of such papers shall
make oath before an officer competent to administer oaths that each signature
is that of the person whose name it purports to be. Within ten (10) days from
the filing of such petition, the City Clerk shall examine the same and, from
the list of qualified voters, ascertain whether or not said petition is signed
by the requisite number of qualified voters and, if necessary, the council
shall allow extra help for that purpose. The City Clerk shall attach to said
petition a certificate showing the result of such examination. If, by the
Clerk's certificate, the petition is shown to be insufficient, it may be
amended within ten (10) days from the date of said certificate. The Clerk
shall, within ten (10) days after such amendment is filed, in case one is
filed, make like examination of the said amended petition and, if that
certificate shall show same to be insufficient, it shall be returned to the
person filing same without prejudice, however, to the filing of a new petition
based upon new and different grounds, but not upon the same grounds. (Props. 1
and 8, 5-5-90)
   b.   If the petition is found sufficient, the City Clerk shall submit the
same to the Council without delay, and the Council, in the event the
Councilmember fails to resign, shall order the said election at the next
possible date allowed by law; provided that, if an election is to be held
within the City for any other purpose within sixty (60) days from the date of
said certificate, then the said recall election shall be held on the same day.
If the Councilmember in question resigns, no recall election shall be necessary
and the vacancy shall be filled as in other cases of vacancies. (Prop. 1, 5-5-
90)
   c.   If the majority of the votes cast at a recall election be for the
recall of the Councilmember, the Council, upon canvassing of the ballots, shall
immediately declare that position vacant and order a special election to fill
it as provided for any vacancies herein. (Prop. 8, 5-5-90)
   d.   No recall petition shall be filed against Councilmembers during the
first six months of their terms, and no Councilmember shall be subject to more
than one recall election on the same grounds. (Prop. 8, 5-5-90)
   e.   Should the Council fail or refuse to order an election as herein
provided for the recall of a Councilmember, when all the requirements for such
election have been complied with by the petitioning citizens, in conformity
with this Charter, then it shall be the duty of any one of the district judges
of Smith County, Texas, upon proper application being made therefor, to order
such election and to enforce the carrying into effect of the provisions of this
Charter. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)
Sec. 19. Law governing elections.
   All elections provided for in this charter shall be conducted and the
results canvassed and announced by the election authorities. The general
election laws of the State of Texas governing municipal elections, Federal law,
and relevant court orders shall control in all municipal elections. (See
federal court order in Cause = TY-75-74-CA, a copy of which is on file in the
City Clerk's office.) (Props. 1 and 8, 5-5-90) (Combined with sec. 18)

   The Council shall appoint a City Manager who shall be the chief executive

indefinite term, as hereinafter provided. The City Manager shall receive such
compensation as may be fixed by the Council. The City Manager shall be
removable at any time at the pleasure of the Council. If removed at any time
after he has served six (6) months, he may demand written charges and the right
to be heard thereon at a public meeting of the Council prior to the date on
which his final removal shall take effect but, pending and during such hearing,
the Council may suspend him from office. The action of the Council in
suspending or removing the City Manager shall be final, it being the intention
of this Charter to vest all authority and fix all responsibility for such
suspension or removal in the Council. The Council may designate some other
officer of the City to perform the duties of the City Manager during absence or
disability. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)
Sec. 21. Department heads; appointment, removal, qualifications.
   The City Manager shall be responsible to the Council for the proper

Council. Such appointments or removals may be disallowed by three-fifths (3/5)
vote of the Council (formerly secs. 24, 25; see sec.
74). The City Manager shall make all appointments to other positions in the
City service upon recommendations of Department Heads. (Props. 1, 5, and 9, 5-
5-90)
   Department Heads shall in every case be chosen for their particular
qualifications in the field of work assigned to them, and shall possess certain
minimum requirements of training and experience, to be determined by the
Council. (Props. 1 and 9, 5-5-90)
Sec. 22. Power and duties specifically of City Manager.
   The powers and duties of the City Manager shall be:
   a.   To assure that the laws and ordinances and policies are enforced;
   b.   To appoint and remove all Department Heads, subject to Council
approval, all such appointments to be upon merit and fitness alone; to oversee
and review the appointment and removal of all subordinate officers and
employees in the departments, all such persons appointed to be qualified and
suitable;
   c.   To exercise control over all departments and divisions created herein
or that may be hereafter created;
   d.   To attend all meetings of the Council with the right to take part in
the discussion but having no vote;
   e.   To recommend to the Council for adoption such measures as deemed
necessary or expedient;
   f.   To keep the Council fully advised as to the financial condition and
needs of the City; and
   g.   To prepare and submit the annual budget on the basis of estimates made
by the departments;
   h.   To perform such other duties as may be prescribed by this Charter or be
required by ordinances or resolutions of the Council. In no case (save when the
Council is considering the removal of the City Manager) shall the Council act
without first having asked the opinion of the City Manager on that point.
(Props. 1 and 9, 5-5-90)
Sec. 23. Administrative departments.

for, all of the offices and departments of the City, and shall represent the
city in all litigation and legal proceedings. The City Attorney shall draft,
approve, or file legal objections to every ordinance adopted by the Council,
and shall pass upon all documents, contracts, and legal instruments in which
the City may have an interest.
   There shall be such Assistant City Attorneys as may be authorized by the
Council and appointed by the City Attorney with the approval of the City
Manager, and such Assistant City Attorneys shall be authorized to act for and
on behalf of the City Attorney. (Prop. 9, 5-5-90)
Sec. 25. Municipal Court.
   There shall be a court known as the Municipal Court of the City, which court
shall be deemed always open for the trial of causes, with such jurisdiction,
powers, and duties as are given and prescribed by the laws of the State of
Texas. The Municipal Court shall be presided over by a magistrate who shall be
known as the Judge of the Municipal Court. The Judge shall be a competent
attorney who is licensed to practice law in the State of Texas and shall be
appointed by the City Manager. The Judge with the approval of the City Manager
shall appoint such equally qualified individuals as necessary to serve as
Alternate Municipal Court Judges in the absence of the Municipal Judge. (Prop.
9, 5-5-90)
Sec. 26. Department Heads; responsibilities.

to confer upon any person or corporation a non-exclusive franchise or right to
use the property of the City for the purpose of furnishing to the public any
general public service, over the streets, highways, alleys, parks and public
property of said City, or for any other purpose whereby a right to appropriate
or use in whole or in part such streets, highways, alleys, parks and other
property of the City is necessary and proper. (Second sentence previously sec.

final reading, which readings shall be at three (3) separate regular meetings
of the Council, the last of which shall take place not less than thirty (30)
days from the first; no ordinance granting a franchise shall pass any reading
except by a vote of a majority of the entire Council. (Previously sec. 38)
   No franchise granting any such right or easement shall ever be valid unless
expressly granted and exercised in compliance with the terms hereof and of the
ordinance granting the same; and no act or omission of the City, its governing
body, officers or agents shall ever be construed to confer or extend by
estoppel or indirection, any right, franchise or easement not expressly granted
by ordinance as above provided. (Props. 1 and 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 36. Reserved. (Moved to sec.
35) (Prop. 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 37. Franchises nonexclusive; maximum period; acquisition by city
   No exclusive privilege or franchise shall ever be granted nor shall any such
franchise or privilege be granted to commence at any time after six (6) months
subsequent to the taking effect of the ordinance granting the same; and all
franchises granted shall be for indeterminate periods, but in no event to
exceed twenty (20) years, and said City shall have the right at any time after

franchise shall be directly or indirectly extended beyond the term originally
fixed by the ordinance granting the same.
(Prop. 1, 5-5-90)

35) (Props. 1 and 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 39. Extension beyond term of franchise prohibited; surrendering and
receiving anew; use, transfer assignment;supervisor of public utilities.
   No franchise, right or privilege now in existence shall be extended beyond
the period now fixed for its termination; provided, however, that any holder of
any franchise, under any charter or ordinance of the City, may, with the
consent of the council, surrender such franchise or franchises subject to the
provisions of this Charter and take a new franchise under and in accordance
with the terms of this Charter; no franchise, privilege or easement shall ever
be used or operated so as to extend or enlarge the terms thereof and no holder
of a franchise heretofore or hereafter granted shall have the right to transfer
or assign such franchise to any other person, firm, or corporation without the
consent of a majority of the entire Council. (Props. 1 and 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 40. Franchise gross receipts assessment.
   All persons, firms or corporations, to whom franchises may hereafter be
granted and their successors or assigns, shall, for the right or privilege
enjoyed, pay to the City such percent of the gross receipts of the business
pursued by such holder as is earned for service rendered in said City, which
percentage shall be specified in the franchise ordinance unless the Council
shall, in lieu of such compensation, provide in the ordinance granting such
right or franchise that there shall be applied to the reduction of fares and
rates such part of the receipts of the business as remains after deducting such
sums as are necessary and proper for operation, taxes, maintenance, renewals
and replacements and a fixed and specified maximum return on a valuation
specified and fixed in the ordinance granting the franchise, which valuation
shall not hereafter be increased except by such actual monies as may thereafter
be expended with the approval and under the direction of the Council, or an
officer empowered to so approve and direct by the Council (provided, if any
franchise holder's property is not being used exclusively to supply service to
the inhabitants of said City, then the proportionate valuation properly
chargeable to said City shall be set up in said ordinance, and increases of
said valuation by the expenditure of actual money shall be set up in the proper
proportion); no such increase, however, shall be allowed except with the
approval and under the direction of the council of said City as hereinbefore
set out.
   All sums required to be paid hereunder shall be due and payable as
negotiated in each individual franchise and shall be exclusive of and in
addition to ad valorem taxes and occupation taxes which may be lawfully levied
and the amount [of] compensation may be changed from time to time as in the
opinion of the Council may be just and reasonable to the extent as such changes
are authorized by the ordinance granting such franchise.
   In order to ascertain the true amount of the gross receipts and to determine
the amount of compensation as well as to ascertain the capital invested,
property value, amount of depreciation and expenses, and for any other purposes
relating to the business in the City, or for the purpose of ascertaining any
fact connected with or relating to the business done by such franchise holder,
the council shall have full power to examine or cause to be examined at any
time and all times the books, papers, and records of franchise holders; to take
testimony and compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books,
papers and records and to examine witnesses under oath and under such rules and
regulations the council may adopt, and should any franchise holder refuse to
permit the inspection of such books, papers, or records by the council or by
anyone designated by them to make such inspection, or fail to produce the same
when notified to do so by the Council, or should any officer, agent or employee
of such franchise holder refuse to give testimony before such Council, then
said Council shall have the power by ordinance to declare the franchise or
privilege enjoyed by such person, firm or corporation so in default, annulled
and terminated.
   The Council shall have the power to appoint a supervisor of public utilities
and to prescribe such powers and duties and to provide that such compensation
and all expenses incurred incident to the proper supervision of public
utilities shall be paid by the public utilities so supervised.
(Props. 1 and 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 41. Prescribing rates and regulations of franchise holders; requiring
extension of or changes in utility service; uniform and equal service required,
exceptions.
   The right is hereby delegated to the City, acting through its Council, to
determine, fix, and regulate the charges, fares, or rates of any person, firm,
or corporation enjoying or that may enjoy a franchise or exercising any other
public privilege in said City and to prescribe the kind of service to be
furnished by such person, firm, or corporation, and the manner in which it
shall be rendered, and from time to time to alter or change such rules,
regulations and compensation. The Council shall make rules and regulations
granting a fair hearing to persons, firms, or corporations to be affected by
said regulations, and no change in regulations shall be adopted except after
notice to the person, firm, or corporation affected and after a fair hearing
shall be granted and held; provided that in adopting such regulations and in
fixing or changing such compensation or determining the reasonableness thereof,
no stocks or bonds authorized or issued by any person or concern enjoying a
franchise shall be considered unless upon proof that the same shall have been
actually issued for money paid and used for the development of the property,
labor done or property actually received in accordance with the laws and
constitution of the state applicable thereto; and in order to ascertain all
facts necessary for a proper understanding of what is or should be a reasonable
rate or regulation, the Council shall have full power to inspect books and
compel attendance of witnesses as provided in
section 40 hereof, and may prescribe all penalties named in
section 40 for a failure or refusal to attend and testify or produce book.
   The Council shall have the power, by ordinance or resolution and without
reference to the other franchise provisions of this charter, to grant the right
and to require street railway companies, gas companies, telephone companies,
telegraph companies, light and power companies, and all other companies or
individuals enjoying a franchise now or hereafter from the City, to make and
furnish necessary changes in or reasonable extensions of facilities and service
in or to any portion of the City (which shall include [in] the case of a street
railway company the building of new or additional lines) as in the judgment of
the council may be necessary, under and subject to the terms and conditions of
the franchise then enjoyed by such franchise holder in connection with which
the change or extension is to be made, and under such further terms and
conditions as the council may deem proper, and the council shall have the power
to prevent the making of unnecessary or unprofitable extensions. Railway
extensions, double tracks, switches or sidings ordered by the City to be
constructed shall be laid without the necessity of obtaining consent of
property owners having property abutting on the streets or alleys to be
occupied thereby, and no such consent need be obtained for new franchise for
the operation of tracks, switches, and sidings already in use at the time of
the granting thereof.
   Every public service corporation shall furnish and provide equal and uniform
service alike to all persons, firms and corporations in the City, and it shall
be unlawful and a sufficient ground for the forfeiture of any franchise for any
such corporation to grant free service or furnish better service or to furnish
services for a lower price or rate, conditions or quality of service
considered, to any person, firm or corporation, than to any other person, firm
or corporation or to otherwise discriminate in the matter of rates or service;
provided, however, that any such public service corporation may from time to
time, with the consent and approval of the Council, adopt schedules governing
rates, conditions, or quantities of service considered, and allow applicants to
choose between alternative schedules, but no such schedule shall be operative
nor shall service be furnished in accordance therewith until filed with and
approved by the Council. Upon proof being received by the council that this
provision is being violated, it shall at once summon witnesses and investigate,
and, if they so find, then it shall be their duty to immediately cause suit to
be instituted to have such franchise forfeited, provided, however, the Council
shall have the power, by ordinance, to grant any franchise holder the right to
grant reduced rates to persons specified in such ordinance, and provided
further that the Council may authorize the giving of free transportation in
other cases when the same shall not be in conflict with the general laws of the
State which shall govern and control this provision.
   No franchise or privilege shall ever be valued for rate making purposes for
any sum above that actually paid the City therefor, and no "going concern" or
"good will" value shall ever be allowed for rate making purposes.
(Props. 1 and 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 42. Acquisition of franchised facility by city; securing a purchaser.
   The City shall have the power to provide and fix in any franchise the amount
or amounts (or the basis for determining the same), to be paid in case it shall
buy any such property and the amount or amounts to be paid by any purchaser, or
purchasers, it may procure to buy such property (or fix a basis for determining
same). If the City shall fail in any franchise to so fix the amounts to be
paid, or the time when such right to purchase or secure a purchaser may be
exercised, it shall, notwithstanding such failure, have the right to buy such
property or to procure a purchaser or purchasers therefor at any time by paying
or causing to be paid the physical value of the property bought, making due
allowance for depreciation, but making no allowance whatever for the value of
the franchise or easement, or for any "going concern" or "good will" value or
for any speculative profits; such value may be determined by the report of the
majority of three (3) arbitrators, one to be selected by the City, one by the
franchise holders and the third by the arbitrators so selected, and, if the two
(2) arbitrators so elected shall fail to agree upon a third arbitrator within
thirty (30) days after their selection, then such third arbitrator may be
selected by any person holding the office of judge of a district court in Smith
County, to whom the City may apply for such appointment. If the franchise
holder shall refuse for thirty (30) days to select an arbitrator, then the
value of such property may be fixed by a vote of the majority of the Council.
The amount or amounts to be paid for such property, or a basis for determining
same as fixed in the ordinance granting such franchises, or in this Charter, if
the franchise does not fix the same, shall be binding on the franchise holder,
who, by accepting a franchise, shall be thereby forever estopped from
questioning the justness or reasonableness of such compensation, and shall be
further estopped from having the question of value of such property determined
in any other manner.
   In acquiring by the City of the property of a franchise holder, as herein
prescribed, such property may be taken subject to the outstanding indebtedness
authorized by the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas, not in excess of
the agreed or arbitrated value, as the case may be. The City shall have the
power to agree that its exercise of its powers conferred in this Charter,
except matters relating to its police power, which shall never be abridged,
shall be exercised in accordance with the terms of any such franchise and to
provide for the settlement through arbitration of any difference between the
City or its supervisor of public utilities, and any franchise holder, and to
provide the extent to which such arbitration shall be binding on the parties
thereto and the effect thereof, and the matters which shall be subject to
arbitration and for the method of selecting arbitrators, not inconsistent with
the terms of this Charter.
   The City shall, in addition to the powers herein expressed, also have the
power to condemn the property of any person, firm, or corporation, now
conducting, operating or maintaining a system or systems of gas, electric
lighting, telephones or street railways, or any other public service or public
utility in the City, for the purpose of distributing such service throughout
the City or any portion thereof, and, in all cases where the City seeks to
exercise such power, it shall be controlled by the laws governing the
condemnation of such property as are now or may hereafter be enacted by the
Legislature of Texas. In the case of such condemnation, all franchise, rights
and privileges of the franchise holder shall cease and the property thereof
shall be vested in the City fee simple title.
   The Council shall have full power to determine and agree in any franchise
upon the manner and form of fixing the lien or pleading or mortgaging the
properties or the receipts therefrom in order to obtain the necessary funds for
acquiring any public utility and operating the same; and the Council shall also
have full power and authority to adopt any such means as may be deemed
advisable for the purpose of financing the raising funds of any such public
utility and providing security therefor.
   Said franchise ordinance shall provide that in the event said City should
acquire the franchise and property of the grantee, either by purchase or
condemnation, that no value shall ever be allowed the franchise holder for said
franchise over and above the price paid therefor after deducting the
proportionate used part of said purchase price so paid therefor, and that no
value shall ever be allowed for "going concern," "goodwill" or "speculative
profits." (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)
Sec. 43. Cancellation of franchises.
   If such franchises shall not be exercised in substantial accordance with the
terms hereof, and of the ordinance granting the same, then, after notice and
reasonable hearing to the holders thereof, such franchise may be canceled or
annulled and the Council shall, by ordinance, adopt reasonable rules and
regulations for such notice and hearing. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)
Sec. 44. Reserved. (Prop. 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 45. Authority to fix and regulate public utility rates.
   The Council shall have the power, by ordinance, to fix and regulate the
price of gas and electric service, regulate and fix the charges of public
carriers transporting passengers and generally to fix and regulate the rates,
or charges and the kind of service of all public utilities of every kind,
except as otherwise provided by State or Federal law. (Props. 1 and 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 46. Authority of City to acquire, operate, etc., utilities and service
facilities; eminent domain authorized.
   The Council, for the purpose of providing the inhabitants of the City with
water, light, heat, and providing for the health and comfort of such
inhabitants, shall have the power to buy, own and construct within or without
the City limits, and to maintain and operate a system or systems of water
works, gas or electric light plant, sewerage plant, abattoir, or any other
public service or public utility, and to demand and receive compensation for
service furnished for private purposes of otherwise; and, to this end, in
addition to all other powers herein expressed, it shall have the power to
exercise the power of eminent domain for the appropriation of lands, rights-of-
way or anything whatsoever that may be proper and necessary to efficiently
carry out such objects, and shall have the further power to condemn the
property of any person, firm or corporation conducting such business within the
City for the purpose of operating and maintaining such public utility, and for
the purpose of distributing such service throughout the City or any portion
thereof. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)
Sec. 47. Purposes of private property appropriated by City; method of
exercising power of eminent domain.
   The Council shall have the power to appropriate private property for public
purposes whenever it shall deem it necessary, and to take any private property
within or without the City limits, for any of the following purposes, to-wit:
Hospitals, water works system, sewer system, gas system, electric light system,
storm sewers, sewage disposal plants, drains, filtering beds and emptying
grounds for sewer systems, reservoirs, water sheds, water supply courses,
wells, cemeteries, crematories, parks, abattoirs, and to acquire lands within
and without the City, for any other municipal purpose that may be deemed
advisable, and the power herein granted for the purpose of acquiring private
property, shall include the power of improvements and enlargement of the water
works, including water supply, riparian rights, stand pipes, water sheds; the
construction of supply reservoirs; provided that in all cases where the Council
seeks to exercise the power of eminent domain, it shall be controlled, as
nearly as practicable by the law governing the condemnation of property by
railroad corporations in this state, the City taking the position of the
railroad corporation in any such case; that the power of eminent domain hereby
conferred shall include the right of the Council to take the fee in the lands
condemned, and shall include the right to condemn public property for such
purposes. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)
Sec. 48. Borrowing money to finance public utility.
   Should the Council determine to construct or acquire any public utility by
purchase, condemnation or otherwise as herein provided, it shall have the power
to obtain funds for the purpose of constructing or otherwise acquiring said
public utility, and paying the compensation therefor, by issuing coupon bonds,
or notes of the City, or other evidences of indebtedness thereof, as provided
in this Charter, and shall have the power if it should determine to do so, to
secure the same by fixing a lien upon the property constituting the public
utility so acquired, and said security shall apply action to said property so
pledged. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)
Sec. 49. Reserved. (Prop. 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 50. Ordering rail street crossings.
   The Council shall have the power and is authorized under this section,
whenever in their discretion the Council shall deem it advisable, to order and
require any railroad company, or interurban railway company, to construct and
maintain overhead, underhead, or grade crossings on all streets of the City
where crossed by such railroad or interurban company.
   Any whenever the Council shall deem it necessary and for the public good to
order any such railroad or interurban company to construct any crossing, the
Council shall in such order fix a reasonable time within which such company
shall comply with the terms of same. (Props. 1 and 12, 5-5-90)
Sec. 51. Opening, closing, improving, etc. streets; collection of cost-
Generally
   a.    The Council shall have the power when it deems advisable to order and
provide for the opening, widening, grading, paving, repaving, repairing, or
otherwise improving the whole or any part of any street, avenue, or alley or
public way in said City, and to assess the cost thereof, as well as a
reasonable fee for collection, if any, against the real estate in the vicinity
of, or abutting on, such improvement in the amount and to the extent that such
property is specially benefitted by such improvement. However, that portion of
the cost of such improvement to be borne by the City shall not be less than the
entire cost of paving or otherwise improving all street intersections which
form a part of such improvement; and provided further that the portion of the
cost of such improvement so assessed against each respective lot or property
shall be and constitute a superior lien thereon and a personal charge against
the owner or owners thereof, which may be collected and foreclosed in any court
having jurisdiction.
   b.    The Council shall have full power to provide for all procedures, rules
and regulations necessary or proper to levy, assess, and collect such special
assessment. Such improvement may be done by the City itself, or by contract for
such work. All of the powers conferred by Ctate law authorizing cities to
improve streets and alleys and make assessments of the same, are adopted as an
alternative method to that already existing in this City, the provisions of
which, or any one of which, may be exercised by the Council or other governing
body whenever it is deemed advisable to do so.
   c.    No such assessment shall be made without notice and hearing on the
question of the amount of special benefits each such piece of property receives
from such improvement, which may be determined at a hearing thereof held either
before the Council or before three (3) or more special councilmembers appointed
by the Council for said purpose, at which hearing each property owner may
appear and contest such issue of special benefits, as well as any other
question relating to such special assessment. Notice of the time and place of
such hearing may be served on such owners by publication thereof in some
newspaper published in said City; provided that such notice shall be published
in accordance with State law. Such notice shall be conclusive upon all such
owners whether residents or nonresidents of said City and the finding and
determination of the Council, or special Councilmembers, as the case may be,
shall be conclusive as to the amount of special benefits each such respective
piece of property receives from such improvement, whether the owner thereof
appears at such hearing or not.
   d.    No property of any kind, church, school or otherwise, in the City
shall be exempt from any of the assessments authorized by this Charter or by
the general laws of the State of Texas or local improvements. (Previously sec.

heretofore been, or may hereafter be, expended for the special improvement,
paving, constructing or grading of any street, avenue, alley, sidewalk, curb,
gutter or public way, or any part thereof, and if, for any reason no part of
the cost thereof has been borne by the abutting property, or paid by the owner
or owners thereof, either because an attempted assessment and enforcement
thereof for same was erroneous or void, or was so declared in any judicial
proceeding, or because no attempt was ever made to assess the same, or for any
other reason, the Council shall have the power to proceed at any time to
specially assess or reassess such abutting property with such amount of the
cost of such improvement as equals the special benefits such property receives
therefrom.
   The amount of such special benefits are to be determined on a basis of the
condition of such improvement as it exists at the time of such assessment or
reassessment. The provisions of
section 51 of this Charter in so far as applicable, shall apply to and govern
the procedure of assessing or reassessing such amount and collecting the same;
and, provided further, that such assessment or reassessment shall not be
construed as becoming due or having become due until the same shall have been
properly made in accordance with this section. (Prop. 1, 5-5-90)

discharging the bonded indebtedness of the City, and for the purpose of
constructing, purchasing or otherwise acquiring and thereafter maintaining and
operating a water works plant, electric light plant, sewer plant, gas plant,
and all other public utilities; and for the purpose of improving the public
parks, markets and streets, erecting, repairing and constructing City
hospitals, City halls, and such other public improvements as they from time to
time may deem expedient, and, in furtherance of these purposes, they shall have
power to borrow money upon the credit of the City and issue coupon bonds of the
City therefor in such sum or sums as they may deem expedient to bear interest
not exceeding six (6) percent per annum, payable annually or semiannually at

   b.   Officer - indirect financial interest of a City officer. A city officer

child, spouse, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law,
daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandfather, grandmother,
grandson, or granddaughter of the City officer has a direct financial interest

   c.   Employee or agent - direct financial interest. A city employee or agent
shall be deemed to have a prohibited direct financial interest in a contract
with the City or in the sale of land, materials, supplies or service to the
City if the City employee or agent has the following interest in a business
entity, or in the real property, and the business entity or related property is
involved in a contract or transaction as defined herein.
      1.   Ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting stock or

son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law has a direct
financial interest as defined in subsection c. of this Section.  (Ord. No. 0-
2005-33, 4/27/05)
Sec. 1-28   Penalties.
   a.   Forfeiture.
      1.   If the City officer has a prohibited financial interest, either
direct or indirect under Section
1-27, and such is found to be a violation of Section
1-27, such action shall constitute malfeasance in office, subjecting the City
officer to forfeiture of office pursuant to
Section 71 of the City Charter.
      2.   If a City employee has a prohibited financial interest, either
direct or indirect, under Section
1-27, he or she automatically forfeits his or her employment upon the final
approval by the City Council of the contract or transaction in which the City
employee has the prohibited financial interest.
      3.   If a prohibited financial interest of either a City officer or a
City employee is not discovered until after the award of the contract or
transaction has occurred, forfeiture shall occur as soon as ascertained, under
either Section
1-27a.1 or 2 above as applicable, and regardless of the lapse of time between
the award and the discovery of the prohibited financial interest.
      4.   If a city contract is in existence at the time the City officer or
City employee or agent is elected or appointed to a position, and the City
officer or employee or agent has a direct or indirect financial interest as
defined herein, the City officer or employee shall not be required to forfeit
his or her position, and the City contract shall not be deemed voidable. Any
contract extensions, options or renewals, however, may not be granted if the
prohibited financial interest of the City officer or employee exists at the
time that the contract extension, option or renewal is due.  NOTE:  The term
“Agent” is excluded from the provisions on “Forfeiting Office”, because Tyler
City Charter
Section 71 only references City officers and employees regarding “forfeiture”,
and does not mention “agents” at all in the “Forfeiture” provision.  The Tyler
City Council would still have the authority under City Code Section
1-20.n. to remove any member of a City Board that is not a City officer from
office, by a majority vote. 
   b.   Voidable Contracts
      Any violation of this Article with the knowledge, express or implied, of
a person or entity contracting or transacting with the City Council, shall
render the contract or transaction involved voidable by either the City Manager
or the City Council.  Notwithstanding the above, the City Council has the final
authority to determine the applicability of the City ethics regulations to the
situation currently under review.  (Ord. No. 0-2005-33, 4/27/05) (Ord. No. 0-
2011-21; 4/13/11)
Sec. 1-29.   Relationship of this Article to Texas Local Government Code
Chapter 171 or successor statute; prohibited substantial interests of City
officer.
   a.   If a City officer  has a prohibited financial interest as defined
herein, in a contract or transaction, then provisions of Texas Local Government
Code Chapter 171 or successor statute are pre-empted by the stricter provisions
of
Section 71 of the City Charter and this Article, so that the application of the
affidavit and abstention provided for in Chapter 171 is inapplicable, since the
contract or transaction cannot be awarded by the City Council unless the City
officer resigns, and therefore the issue of abstention is moot.
   b.   If the City officer does not have a prohibited financial interest as
defined herein, but does have a prohibited substantial interest as defined in
this subsection pursuant to Texas Local Government Code Chapter 171, then the
provisions of Chapter 171 are applicable, and the City officer must comply with
the requirements for abstention and for an affidavit of substantial interest
under Texas Local Government Code Chapter 171 or successor statute.  For
purposes of this subsection, a person has a prohibited direct substantial
interest in a business entity, or in real property, and the business entity or
real property involved in a contract or transaction as defined herein. 
      1.   Ownership of ten percent (10%) or more of the voting stock or shares
of the business entity; or
      2.   Ownership of ten percent (10%) or more or $15,000 or more of the
fair market value of the business entity; or
      3.   Funds received by the person from the business entity exceed ten
percent (10%) of the person's gross income for the previous year; or
      4.   Legal ownership, with a fair market value of $2500 or more, in the
real estate involved in the transaction; or
      5.   Equitable ownership, with a fair market value of $2500 or more, in
the real estate involved in the transaction.
   c.   For purposes of this Section, a City officer has a prohibited indirect
substantial interest in a business entity if a parent, child, spouse, brother,
sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-
law or sister-in-law of the City officer has a prohibited direct substantial
interest as defined in subsection b. of this Section. (Ord. No. 0-2005-33, 4/

state of the art clinical quality care, with reasonable, reliable response time
standards, and with the goal of furnishing the best possible chance of
survival, without disability or preventable complication, to each ambulance
patient.
   b.   To establish a sole-provider ambulance system, because it is
unreasonable to have unnecessarily high rates and/or public subsidy to make
needed improvements to ambulance service in the service area, when a more
efficiently designed system can achieve the same results at lower cost. The
most efficient design to achieve the goals of high-quality service, at the
lowest cost, consistent with the quality of care required, is the
implementation of the system described herein.
   c.   To provide a method to develop specific performance standards, adequate
review, and either continuation of service or an appropriate procedure to
obtain alternate proposals from other providers.
   d.   To provide more effective medical control by establishing a multi-
jurisdictional Medical Control Board (MCB) and by empowering that Board to
oversee and regulate all clinical aspects of the emergency medical system which
affect patient care.
   e.   To establish a uniform EMS ordinance that could be adopted by other
jurisdictions who wish to take advantage of a uniform standard of pre-hospital
care in recognition of the role of Tyler/ Smith County medical facilities and
health care community as a regional provider of primary, secondary, and
tertiary medical care.  (Ord. No. O–98-45, 5/27/98)

serve as both a regulatory and contractual standard.
   Uniform schedule of price/subsidy options: The initially established and
annually revised listing of per capita subsidy and user fee combinations then
currently approved by the EMS Administrative Agency. To avoid cross-
jurisdictional subsidization of costs of serving patients in more remote
jurisdictions (i.e., which patient transport times and mileage are extended) by
way of excessive fee structures charged in less remote jurisdictions (i.e.,
where patient transport time and mileage are reduced), mileage charges shall be
excluded from subsidy/price calculations, and shall be uniform throughout the
contract service area. Thus, subsidy payments, if any, shall be applied
entirely to reduce the total base rate and add-on charges, excluding mileage,

Annual service rating. The MCB shall provide an annual written report
evaluating the contractor's clinical and response time performance during the
previous contract year. In preparing this annual evaluation, each member of the
MCB shall rate the contractor's clinical reliability and response time
performance (separately) in accordance with the criteria below. The signed and
dated individual rating sheets of each MCB member shall be collected by the
administrator, distributed to all member and participating jurisdictions, and
kept on file by the administrator, and shall be public documents. The average
of all reviewers' numerical scores earned by the contractor over the previous
contract year shall determine contractor's eligibility for a one-year extension
to the ambulance service contract, to be added to the then-remaining term of
the contract as provided for in the ambulance service contract. Earned renewal
rights shall be conditioned on the contractor's earning a combined average
score in excess of 3.0 for the previous twelve-month period, as determined in
accordance with the following criteria:
         Score            Criteria
         I/I         Inadequate information. The reviewer has had insufficient
opportunity to observe and review contractor's clinical and response time
performance over the previous year to fairly and accurately rate the service.
(Such review shall be excluded from the calculations, and shall have no effect
on the average score.)
         0         Chronic failure to comply with the system standard of care
and/or contractual response time requirements, of such nature and magnitude
that public health and safety have been threatened.
         1         Frequent failure to comply with the system standard of care
and/or contractual response time requirements, with a poor record of responsive
and effective effort to correct such deficiencies as they are discovered.
         2         Occasional, but still excessive, failure to comply with the
system standard of care and/or contractual response time requirements, with a
record of  minimal and ineffective effort to correct such deficiencies as they
are discovered.
         3         Substantial compliance with the system standard of care and/
or contractual response time requirements, with a good record of responsive and
effective effort to correct deficiencies as they are discovered.
         4         Highly reliable compliance with the system standard of care
and/or contractual response time requirements, with a superior record of 
responsive and effective effort to correct deficiencies as they are discovered.
         5         Exemplary compliance with the system standard of care and/or
contractual response time requirements, with a history of leadership in efforts
to advance the system standard of care and an impressive record of relentless
effort to identify and correct performance deficiencies.
         4.         Authorize the issuance, denial, revocation, suspension, or
restriction of licenses, permits and certifications issued pursuant to this
article, all in accordance with due process steps approved by the City
attorney.
   e.   Selection of patient destination. Medical protocols approved by MCB
shall establish protocols for selection of the destination hospital, which
protocols shall be strictly followed by paramedic personnel and on-line medical
control physicians, except when a departure from protocol is justified on the
basis of special considerations of patient care or practical barriers to
implementation (e.g., blocked roads, hospital divert status, etc.). In
developing such "transport protocols," the MCB shall strictly adhere to the
following priorities of consideration, and shall recognize these priorities in
the sequence presented:
      1.   First consideration: patient care and safety;
      2.   Second consideration: patient/family choice; and
      3.   Third consideration: fairness in distribution of patients among
hospitals. In this regard, the following rules shall apply:
         (a)   Non-emergencies. All "non-emergency patients" shall be
transported to the destination selected by the patient, the patient's family,
or the patient's personal physician, without exception.
         (b)   Non-life-threatening emergencies. Patients experiencing a "non-
life-threatening emergency" shall be transported to the facility of choice
designated by the patient, the patient's family, or the patient's personal
physician, or if no such preference is stated, to the nearest hospital approved
by the MCB for receipt of patients experiencing non-life-threatening
emergencies.
         (c)   Life-threatening emergencies. Patients experiencing life-
threatening emergencies (as defined by patient-assessment protocols approved by
the MCB shall, in accordance with transport protocols approved by the MCB, be
delivered to the "nearest appropriate facility," taking into consideration the
patient's condition and location, the patient's medical requirements, and the
respective capabilities of hospitals within (and for some types of patients,
outside) the "contract service area." Such transport protocols shall not be
inconsistent with then-currently approved trauma system protocols (when
available).
         (d)   Enforcement. Inappropriate and unjustified deviations from these
patient-destination protocols by a paramedic without direct authorization by a
base station physician or inappropriate and unjustified instructions regarding
such deviation by a base station physician shall be subject to sanction by the
MCB provided such sanctions are applied in accordance with due process
procedures approved by the City Attorney. Such sanctions may include reprimand,
suspension of certification, or revocation of certification, depending upon
frequency and severity of error.
   f.   Binding arbitration available. In the event any hospital desires to
dispute a policy of the MCB affecting patient distribution, that hospital may
at its option institute procedures for binding arbitration as follows:
      1.   The hospital wishing to contest the specified policy shall present
its position in writing to the MCB, including one or more proposed remedies
acceptable to the hospital.
      2.   If the MCB rejects all remedies proposed by the hospital, the
hospital may appoint a physician expert in the medical specialty to which the
contested policy is related to serve as a member of an arbitration team,
provided that such physician shall have no affiliation, direct or indirect,
with any hospital or physician group practicing within the "contract service
area."
      3.   The MCB shall then appoint a physician expert in the medical
specialty to which the contested policy is related to serve as a member of the
arbitration team, provided that such physician shall have no affiliation,
direct or indirect, with any hospital or physician group practicing within the
"contract service area."
      4.   The two (2) appointed members of the arbitration team shall then
jointly appoint a physician expert in the medical specialty to which the
contested policy is related to serve as the third member of the arbitration
team, provided that such physician shall have no affiliation, direct or
indirect, with any hospital or physician group practicing within the "contract
service area."
      5.   The arbitration team shall then review such written documentation
related to the dispute as may be available, and shall conduct such site visit
inspections and on-site interviews as the team deems appropriate, and shall
render a decision on the disputed matter either in favor of the MCB or in favor
of the hospital initiating the arbitration process, and such decision shall be
final. The arbitration team shall not have authority to impose any resolution
which was not proposed by either the or the hospital initiating the
proceedings.
      6.   All actual and reasonable cost of the arbitration process, including
consulting fees and travel reimbursement, shall be paid by the hospital
initiating the arbitration process.
   g.   For each patient transported pursuant to this article, the ambulance
service contractor shall pay to the City a fee of one dollar ($1.00), which sum
shall be used to defray the costs of medical regulation of the EMS system
including clerical functions. Such payments shall be made monthly by the
fifteenth (15th) day of each month for services rendered during the previous
calendar month. Provided, however, that such requirement for payment shall not
become effective until such time as uncertainties regarding interpretation of
Medicare "anti-kickback" provisions have been favorably resolved to the
satisfaction of City.  (Ord. No. O–98-45, 5/27/98)

contained in this Article concerning any prohibited act, but any such exception
made in this Article may be urged as a defense by any person charged by such
complaint. (Ord. No. O–98-45, 5/27/98)
Sec. 1-56.   Failure to pay service charges unlawful.
   a.   It shall be unlawful for any person, with intent to defraud, to request
or accept the service of any ambulance within the City, having no intention of
paying for such service.
   b.   Failure, by the person requesting or accepting the services of an
ambulance, to pay to the person furnishing such service the customary charge
therefor within ninety (90) days after demand for payment is made, shall be
prima facie evidence of intent to defraud and prima facie evidence that such
person had no intention of paying for such services when the same were
requested or accepted.
   c.   Demand for payment, as used in this Article, shall be written demand,
sent by registered or certified mail addressed to the person requesting or
accepting such services and to the address given by or on behalf of such person
at the time the services were requested or accepted. Intent to defraud or

shall be due from the guest, and shall be collected by the lodging provider at
the same time that the rent is collected . The lodging provider shall be liable
to the city for the full amount received or collected as tax, whether collected
appropriately or inappropriately, and for any amount of tax that should have

not remitted or caused to be remitted, plus penalty. The dissolution of a
corporation, partnership or other business or fraternal association does not
affect a responsible individual’s liability under this subsection. Furthermore,
the liability imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to any other
penalty provided by law.  (Ord. No. 0-2011-54; 07/13/2011)

ARTICLE III. TAX ABATEMENT POLICY
Sec. 2-30.  Tax Abatement Policy Principles.
   a.    A city, pursuant to State law, is authorized to offer abatement of
City ad valorem taxes to industries and commercial enterprises within the City
limits. The tax abatements are granted to real property owners who execute a
tax abatement agreement with the City. The purpose of the tax abatement is to
encourage the growth and establishment of industry and commercial enterprise in
the City.  Growth is measured both by increases in capital expenditure for
buildings, machinery, and other capital goods and the increase in the Tyler
workforce. The City's priority for tax abatement is to extend tax abatement to
primary employers.  A primary employer is one which forms the economic base of
the community by generating a majority of sales outside of Smith County. In
providing local jobs, the retention of existing jobs is recognized as more
important than recruitment of new companies. Surveys in Texas have shown three-
fourths of new jobs come from expansion of existing local companies.  Abatement
is given to provide significant, long term, positive economic impact to the
community by using local contractors and the resident workforce to the maximum
extent feasible and by developing, redeveloping and improving real estate
within the City limits. The City's goal in providing tax abatements is to
create additional jobs within the City. Abatements, however, may be granted
when the City is convinced that the abatement is needed to retain existing jobs
which would otherwise be lost. Examples of uses eligible for abatements include
manufacturing, distribution centers, corporate or regional office parks, and
research facilities.  Small companies have provided a significant source of new
jobs within the City. Therefore, proposals by small entrepreneurs will be
encouraged whenever the proposals comply with the policies of this chapter.
 
   b.     The City strives for efficiency in processing applications for tax
abatement.  It is understood that unduly long decision-making processes will
discourage businesses that might otherwise be interested in moving to or
expanding in Tyler. (Ord. No. O-98-21; 3/18/98) (Ord. No. O-2000-74, 9/27/00)
(Ord. No. O-2002-33, 8/28/2002) (Ord. No. O-2004-63, 8/25/04) (Ord. No. O-2006-
87; 10/11/06) (Ord. No. O-2008-148; 11/19/08) (Ord. No. O-2011-6, 1/12/2011)

Sec. 2-31.  Abatement Eligibility Criteria.
 
   a.   Tax abatement will be considered for the following facilities if such
development will create substantial capital improvements within the City limits
or additional jobs:

      1.   Manufacturing facilities;
      2.   Distribution facilities;
      3.   Corporate offices;
      4.   Research parks;
      5.   Major tourism attractions;

   b.   Successful applicants must be located within a reinvestment zone prior
to the inception of the project.

   c.   The project must provide for capital expenditures of at least one
million dollars or an annual payroll increase of four hundred thousand dollars
or the creation of twenty-five new permanent full-time jobs.

   d.   When an investment improves existing property, the portion of the value
of property eligible for abatement is:

      1.   For real property, the value of real property which has increased in
market value because of the development, re-development or improvements
specified in the abatement contract.

      2.   For personal property, the market value of the personal property at
the location, other than inventory or supplies, purchased with new capital
identified in the tax abatement contract. Personal property located at the site
before the period covered by the agreement, is not eligible for tax abatement.

      3.   If the investment meets the criteria set out in paragraph c., the
property eligible for abatement may be personal, real or mixed. (Ord. No. 0-98-
21; 3/18/98) (Ord. No. O-2000-74, 9/27/00) (Ord. No. 0-2002-33, 8/28/2002)

51; 6/26/19)
 
Sec. 2-32.  Abatement Review.
   a.   The City Manager, in consultation with the Tyler Economic Development
Council, will initially negotiate all tax abatement contracts agreements. The
proposed contracts will then be submitted to the Reinvestment Zone Committee
for review. The recommendation of the Reinvestment Zone Committee will be
submitted to all participating local governments, including the City Council.

   b.   A Reinvestment Zone Committee is responsible for reviewing all
applications for abatement, recommending action to be taken on the application
by the City Council, and monitoring compliance with abatement contracts. Any
deviations from the original abatement contract will be reported by the
committee to the City Council along with recommendations from the committee. If
recommended by the committee, an abatement contract may be terminated by action
of the City Council if the property owner fails to comply with the agreement.
Notification of such termination for cause shall be in writing and shall be
delivered to the property owner at its address of record. An abatement contract
may also be voluntarily terminated where all parties agree through use of a
termination agreement approved by the City Council.  Committee members shall be
appointed by the City Manager and will include representatives who are active
in promoting the economic health of the City and the other affected taxing
jurisdictions. The committee will include representatives from each of the
taxing entities that will be asked to participate in a tax abatement contract. 
Members do not have to be City residents.

   c.   When considering abatement contracts, the City will consider any
burdens which will be placed on existing infrastructure and basic services by
the proposed project. The City may reject applications which place inordinate
demands on public services or require inordinately large expenditures to
improve or maintain local government infrastructure.

   d.   Representatives of the taxing jurisdictions periodically review
commitments made pursuant to this policy: this policy is reviewed every two
years; all reinvestment zones are reviewed every five years; and tax abatement
contracts are reviewed annually. This policy is separate from any policy
concerned with enterprise zones and any obligations deriving from existing
industrial development contracts. (Ord. No. O-98-21; 3/18/98) (Ord. No. O-2000-

ARTICLE V.  INVESTMENT POLICY
Sec. 2-46.   Introduction And Scope.
   The Public Funds Investment Act, Chapter 2256, Texas Government Code, (the
"PFIA") requires each city to adopt a written investment policy that includes a
written investment strategy, quarterly reports to City Council with market
values, an annual review of the policy by Council and an annual compliance
audit among other requirements.  This Policy shall apply to the investment and
management of all City funds under its control, other than those expressly
excluded within this document or by applicable law or valid agreement.  The
Fire Pension Fund is excluded from this Policy because it is separately
organized and managed by contract with investment companies as directed by the
Fire Pension Board, and the Lindsey Police and Firefighters' Endowment Fund is
also excluded from this Policy because it is separately organized and managed
by contract with an investment company as directed by the Lindsey Police and
Firefighters' Fund Board.  The Employees Deferred Compensation Agency Fund and
the Retirees Health Benefits Trust Fund are also excluded.  This Policy shall
not supersede the restrictions on investment of specific funds because of legal
limits, created by grants, bond covenants or similar regulations.  In the event
of conflict, the more restrictive policy shall be followed.  (Ord. No. 0-98-21;

   The City shall use a pooled cash and investment approach commingling money
from various fund types for market efficiency to the extent that is practical

unique advantages of a pooled cash and investment portfolio, including the
reduction of cash flow uncertainty and the increased opportunity of yield curve
extension.  Funds included in the portfolio will include those from the
operating funds, debt service and debt reserve funds, and special projects. 
The liquidity requirements of the pooled investment portfolio will be projected
and matched with maturities.

Suitability - Any investment eligible in the Investment Policy is suitable for
Pooled Fund Groups.

Safety of Principal - All investments shall be of high quality with no
perceived default risk.
Market price fluctuations will occur.  However, managing the weighted average
days to maturity to less than 270 days and restricting the maximum allowable
maturity to two years using the final stated maturity dates of each investment
will minimize the price volatility of the portfolio

Marketability - Securities with active and efficient secondary markets are
necessary in the event of an unanticipated cash flow requirement.  Historical
market "spreads" between the bid and offer prices of a particular security-type
of less than a quarter of a percentage point will define an efficient secondary
market.

Liquidity - Pooled Fund Groups require short-term liquidity to adequately fund
any unanticipated cash outflow.  Short-term financial institution deposits,
investment pools and money market mutual funds will provide daily liquidity and
may be utilized as a competitive yield alternative to fixed maturity
investments.

Diversification - Investment maturities should be staggered throughout the
budget cycle to provide cash flow based on the anticipated operating needs of
the City.  Diversifying the appropriate maturity structure up to the two-year
maximum will reduce interest rate risk.

Yield - Attaining a competitive market yield for comparable security-types and
portfolio restrictions is the desired objective.  The yield of an equally
weighted, rolling three-month Treasury Bill portfolio will be the minimum yield
objective.
Special Project And Bond Proceeds Funds
At times special project and bond proceed funds may be better suited invested
outside the Pooled Fund Group.  In those cases the following strategy shall be
applicable:

Suitability - Any investment eligible in the Investment Policy is suitable for
Special Project and Bond Proceeds Funds.

Safety of Principal - All investments will be of high quality with no perceived
default risk.  Market price fluctuations will occur.  However, by managing
Special Project and Bond Proceeds to not exceed the anticipated expenditure
schedule the market risk of the overall portfolio will be minimized.  Maximum
maturity five years from date of purchase.

Marketability - Securities with active and efficient secondary markets are
necessary in the event of an unanticipated cash flow requirement.  Historical
market "spreads" between the bid and offer prices of a particular security-type
of less than a quarter of a percentage point will define an efficient secondary
market.

Liquidity - Special Project and Bond Proceeds Funds used for capital
improvements programs have reasonably predictable draw down schedules. 
Therefore investment maturities should generally follow the anticipated cash
flow requirements.  Short term financial institution deposits,  investment
pools and money market mutual funds will provide readily available funds
generally equal to one month's anticipated cash flow needs, or a competitive
yield alternative for short term fixed maturity investments.  A singular
repurchase agreement, or similarly structured investment vehicle, may be
utilized if disbursements are allowed in the amount necessary to satisfy any
expenditure request. This investment structure is commonly referred to as a
flexible repurchase agreement.

Diversification - Market conditions and arbitrage regulations influence the
attractiveness of staggering the maturity of fixed rate investments for Special
Project and Bond Proceeds Funds.  Generally, when investment rates exceed the
applicable cost of borrowing, the City is best served by locking in most
investments.  If the cost of borrowing cannot be exceeded, then concurrent
market conditions will determine the attractiveness of diversifying maturities
or investing in shorter and larger amounts.  At no time shall the anticipated
expenditure schedule be exceeded in an attempt to bolster yield.

Yield - Achieving a positive spread to the cost of borrowing is the desired
objective, within the limits of the Investment Policy's risk constraints.  The
yield of an equally weighted, rolling six-month Treasury bill portfolio will be
the minimum yield objective for non-borrowed funds.  (Ord. No. 0-2000-21, 3/22/

Sec. 2-49.   Investment Officers.
   The Chief Financial Officer, Accounting Manager, and Accountants are
appointed as Investment Officers.  The Investment Officer's authority will be
limited by applicable laws, regulations and this Policy.

   In order to ensure qualified and capable investment management, the City
shall provide periodic training in investments for the investment personnel
through courses and seminars offered by professional organizations and
associations in compliance with the PFIA.

   Investment Officers shall attend at least one training session, accumulating
at least 10 hours of instruction, within twelve months of assuming their
duties.  An additional eight hours of training will be required not less than
once in a two-year period that begins on the first day of the City's fiscal
year and consists of the two consecutive fiscal years after that date. Training
will address investment topics in compliance with the PFIA.  The City approves
the GFOA, GFOAT, GTOT, NTCOG, TCMA, TML, and UNT as independent sources for
training.

   The City maintains the right to hire Investment Advisers to assist City
staff in the investment of funds.  Investment Advisers shall adhere to the
spirit, philosophy and specific terms of this Policy and shall invest within
the same objectives.  The Investment Officers shall establish criteria to
evaluate Investment Advisers, including:
1.   Understanding of the inherent fiduciary responsibility of investing public
funds;
2.   Adherence to the City's policies and strategies;
3.   Investment strategy recommendations within accepted risk constraints;
4.   Responsiveness to the City's request for services and information; and
5.   Similarity in philosophy and strategy with the City's objectives.
   Selected Investment Advisors must be registered under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 or with the State Securities Board.  A contract with an
Investment Adviser may not be for a term longer than two years and any
contract, renewal or extension is subject to approval by the City Council.

Sec. 2-50.   Standards of Care, Ethics and Conflicts of Interest.
   As provided for in the PFIA, the standard of care for the City's investments
shall be the Prudent Person Rule, which states "investments shall be made with
judgment and care, under prevailing circumstances, that a person of prudence,
discretion and intelligence would exercise in the management of the person's
own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable
safety of capital and the probable income to be derived."

   The overall investment program shall be designed and managed with a degree
of care and professionalism that is worthy of the public trust.  The Investment
Officers shall recognize that the investment activities of the City are a
matter of public record and public trust.

   The Investment Officers, acting in accordance with written procedures and
exercising the proper standard of care, shall be relieved of personal
responsibility for an individual investment decision, provided that this Policy
and the City's procedures were followed.  In determining whether an Investment
Officer has exercised the proper standard of care, all investments over which
the individual had responsibility will be considered rather than a single
investment.

   Investment Officers and employees of the City involved in the investment
process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with
proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability
to make impartial investment decisions. Investment Officers and employees of
the City involved in the investment process shall not utilize investment advice
concerning specific investments  or classes of investments obtained in the
transaction of the City's business for personal investment decisions, shall in
all respects subordinate their personal investment transaction to those of the
City particularly with regard to the timing of purchases and sales, and shall
keep confidential all investment advice obtained on behalf of the City and all
transactions contemplated and completed by the City, except when disclosure is
required by law.

   All Investment Officers of the City shall file with the Texas Ethics
Commission and the City Council a statement disclosing any personal business
relationship with a business organization offering to engage in an investment
transaction with the City or any relationship within the second degree by
affinity or consanguinity to an individual seeking to sell investments to the
City.  (Ord. No. 0-98-21; 3/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2000-21, 3/22/00) (Ord. No. 0-

Sec. 2-51.   Authorized Investments.
   The Investment Officers shall use only investment options approved by City
Council. Participation in any investment pool must also be approved by formal
Council action.  Subject to any limitations otherwise imposed by applicable
law, regulations, bond indentures or other agreements, including but not
limited to, the PFIA, the following are the only permitted investments for the
City's funds:

      a.   Direct obligations of the United States government; U.S. Treasury
Bills, U.S. Treasury Notes, U.S. Treasury Bonds, and U.S. Treasury Strips (book
entry U.S. Treasury securities whose coupon has been removed).

      b.   Debentures or discount notes issued by, guaranteed by, or for which
the credit of any Federal Agencies and Instrumentalities, including the Federal
Home Loan Banks, is pledged for payment.  Principal-only and interest-only
mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations and real
estate mortgage investment conduits are expressly prohibited.

      c.   Bonds or other interest bearing obligations of which the principal
and interest are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States
government, including obligations that are fully guaranteed or insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Principal-only and interest-only
mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations and real
estate mortgage investment conduits are expressly prohibited.

      d.   Certificates of Deposit and other evidences of deposit at a
financial institution that, a) has its main office or a branch office in Texas
and is guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
its successor, b) is secured by obligations in a manner and amount provided by
law for deposits of the City, or c) is placed through a broker or depository
institution that has its main office or a branch office in Texas that meets the
requirements of the PFIA.  All deposits exceeding the FDIC insurance limits
shall be collateralized as required by Section 2-57 Selection of Depositories. 


      e.   Local government investment pools organized under the Interlocal
Cooperation Act that meet the requirements of the PFIA and have been
specifically approved and authorized by the City Council.

      f.   Direct obligations of the State of Texas or its agencies, and
obligations of agencies, counties, cities, and other political subdivisions of
the State of Texas rated as to investment quality by a nationally recognized
investment rating firm not less than A or its equivalent.

      g.   No load "government" money market mutual funds that meet the
requirements of the PFIA.  Money market mutual funds must maintain an AAAm, or
equivalent rating from at least one nationally recognized rating agency; and be
specifically approved by the City Council or purchased through the City's
primary depository as an overnight investment tool.

      h.   Repurchase agreements entered into in compliance with the PFIA.

   NOTE: A security's "average life" does not constitute a stated maturity.

   No investment type approved by the PFIA for public investment will be
authorized by the City without specific City Council approval and adoption in
this Investment Policy.  And investments authorized at the time of purchase,
which become unauthorized, need not be liquidated immediately.  The City shall
monitor the rating of each issuer, as applicable, at least quarterly, and take
all prudent measures to liquidate an investment that is downgraded to less than
its required minimum rating by PFIA.  The Investment Officer(s) will make
specific suggestions as to the possible liquidation or retention in either
situation. The City will provide a competitive environment for individual
investment transactions, and financial institution, money market mutual fund,
and local government investment pool selections.

   This Policy does not apply to an investment donated to the City for a
particular purpose or under terms of use specified by the donor (Section
2256.004).  (Ord. No. 0-98-21; 3/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2000-21, 3/22/00) (Ord. No.

Sec. 2-52.   Investment Limits.
   It is the City's policy to diversify its investment portfolio.  Invested
funds shall be diversified to minimize risk or loss resulting from over-
concentration of assets in a specific maturity, specific issuer, or specific
class of investment, where appropriate.  Cash flow projections shall be
utilized to spread investment maturities, smooth market fluctuations, and
reduce reinvestment risk.

   The maturity of an investment largely dictates its price volatility. 
Therefore, the City shall concentrate its investment portfolio in shorter-term
maturities to protect market valuation from unanticipated rate movements.  The
City will attempt to avoid over-investment in cash equivalent investments and
match a portion of its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. 
The asset allocation in the portfolio will vary depending upon those
requirements and the outlook for the economy and the security markets. (Ord.

Sec 2-53.   Selection of Broker/Dealers.
   The City may utilize the in-house brokerage services of the bank qualifying
as City depository in the acquisition and disposition of authorized
securities.  Other broker/dealers meeting the qualifications of this Policy
section and selected by the Investment Officers are reviewed and approved by
the City Council.

   The approved list of broker/dealers includes the following firms:

      Duncan-Williams Securities

      FHN Financial

      MBS Securities
      SAMCO

      Wells Fargo Securities

   For brokers and dealers of investment securities, the City shall select only
dealers reporting to the Market Reports Division of the Federal Reserve Board
of New York, also known as the "Primary Government Security Dealers," unless
analysis reveals that other firms are adequately experienced to conduct public
business. 

   All financial institutions and broker/dealers who desire to become qualified
bidders for investment transactions must supply the following as appropriate:
"   Annual audited financial statements
"   Proof of Texas State Securities Commission registration
"   Proof of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) certification

   Each entity from which the City purchases investments (brokers/banks/pools)
shall be provided the City's Investment Policy.  Investment pools and
discretionary investment management firms will be required to provide a written
certification as described in the PFIA. 

   It is the policy of the City to create a competitive environment for all
individual purchases and sales, financial institution deposits, money market
mutual funds, and local government investment pools.  (Ord. No. 0-98-21; 3/18/

of all investments in compliance with the PFIA.  The market valuations obtained
by the City shall be from independent sources believed to be accurate and
representative of the investments' true values.  The reports shall be submitted
to City Council.

   An annual compliance audit of management's controls on investments and
adherence to this Investment Policy shall be performed in conjunction with the
annual financial audit and include a review of quarterly reports, with the
result of the review reported to the City Council by that auditor. 

   The benchmark for the portfolio will be the three-month Treasury Bill
average yield for the reporting period.  Reporting will include the benchmark
as a gauge of the portfolio's performance and a measure of risk.  Weighted
average yield to maturity shall be the measure of portfolio performance.  (Ord.

against the City. The City Manager, upon recommendation from the City Attorney,
is hereby authorized to settle such claims, including those involving pending
litigation, by denying or paying an amount up to and including twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000.00).  Periodically, the City Manager shall notify the

expenses (excluding plumbing and lodging expenses) not covered by insurance up
to and including an amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000).  In no case does

liability on the part of the City.  Periodically, the City Council shall be
notified of the status of all such overflow claims. (Ord. No. 0-98-21; 3/18/98)
(0-2003-63, 11/26/03) (0-2006-102, 12/13/06) (Ord. No. 0-2017-20; 2/22/17)
Sec. 2-62.   Indemnification.
   a.   Any official, employee, or member of a City Council appointed Board who
is liable for the payment of any claims or damages, excluding punitive damages,
arising out of the course and scope of employment, or discharge of board
duties, shall be entitled to indemnification by the City provided that the acts
or omissions resulting in such liability were done in good faith and without
malicious or felonious intent. The City shall not indemnify such person:
      1.   To the extent that the damages are insured under a contract of
insurance or any other plan of self-insurance or risk retention authorized by
statute;
      2.   For any award of punitive damages against said person;
      3.   For an act or omission on the part of an official, employee, or
board member which, in the opinion of the City, constitutes gross negligence,
official misconduct, or an act or omission made in bad faith, or acts
constituting fraud, dishonesty or a criminal act.  Additionally, no indemnity
shall apply to claims or other actions by the City against an official,
employee or board member.
   For the purpose of this section, the term "arising out of the course and
scope of employment" shall not include any action which occurs during a period
of time in which the officer or employee is engaged in outside employment or is
rendering contractual services to someone other than the City. Whether the acts
were done in good faith, without malicious or felonious intent, and within the
course and scope of employment , or discharge of board duties, shall be
determined by the City, and such determination shall be final for the purposes
of the representation and indemnity of this section. Additionally, the City
Council reserves the right to refuse indemnification or to defend a person
based upon the factual circumstances from which damages have arisen.
   However, in the event such representation and indemnity have been denied by
the City, and as a result of a trial on the merits, the City determines that
the person was acting in good faith, without malicious or felonious intent and
within the scope of employment or discharge of board duties, the
indemnification hereunder shall be granted and reasonable legal expenses
incurred in the defense of the claim reimbursed.
   b.   The City shall not be liable for any settlement of such claim or suit
effected without its consent, and the City reserves the right to assert any
defense and make any settlement of any claim or suit that it deems expedient.
   c.   The City will pay only actual damages, court costs and attorney's fees
incurred or adjudged against a person  covered by this section. Damages must be
based on an act, omission or negligence of the person in the course or scope of
employment or discharge of board duties.
   d.   Representation in actions.
      1.   The City shall have the right and duty to provide legal
representation through the City Attorney or, in its discretion through the
selection of outside legal counsel, to any officer, employee, or board member
sued in connection with any claim for damages or other civil action, provided
that person is entitled to indemnification as set forth in this section. Such
legal representation shall be provided at no cost to the person, and any person
may have his or her own counsel assist in the defense at the sole expense of
the person. The person shall cooperate fully with the City in preparation and
presentation of the case, and the failure to cooperate shall waive such
person’s right to representation and indemnity under this section.
      2.   When in the opinion of the City Attorney, there is a potential
conflict of interest and the person has acted in a manner consistent with the
policies, practices and/or customs of the City, the City Attorney, or other
legal counsel hired by the City, may continue the defense of the person and the
City shall indemnify the person, in lieu of hiring additional counsel.
      3.   If a person hires an attorney to represent him/her without the
consent and concurrence of the City Attorney, the City may not pay nor
reimburse said person for the costs of representation, and the City reserves
the right to refuse indemnification under such circumstances.
   e.   City's defenses. Nothing in this section shall be construed as waiving
the City's defense of governmental immunity to it or its employees, officers,
or board members  in any action brought against the City or such person. For
any suit or claim arising under the Texas Tort Claims Act or successor, the
indemnity provided by this section shall be limited to the statutory limits
applicable to the City provided in said Act, as amended.
   f.   Actions. Nothing in this section shall prevent the City from taking
disciplinary action against any officer or employee or removing a board member
for conduct defended or indemnified by the City under this section, either
before or after conclusion of the civil suit.
   g.   Suits in behalf of the City. Nothing in this section shall require the
City to indemnify any officer, employee, or board member for recoveries made
against him or her in suits by or on behalf of the City. The City Council may,
however, authorize the City Attorney to represent any officer, employee, or
board member on behalf of the City in a suit brought by a taxpayer against the
such person. (Ord. No. 0-98- 21; 3/18/98)

ARTICLE VII. PAVING ASSESSMENTS
Sec. 2-70.   Owner liable.
   Effective January 1, 1998, under normal circumstances the City will no
longer use paving assessments against adjacent owners.  However, in situations
where City must purchase right-of-way or in circumstances where owner's value
is being significantly enhanced, City reserves the right to seek paving
assessments. All prior assessments shall remain valid and subject to the rules
in this Article.  All assessments levied are a personal liability and charge
against the real and true owners of the premises described, even though such
owners may not be named or may be incorrectly named.  (Ord. No. 0-98-21; 3/18/
98)
Sec. 2-71.   Payment.
   a.   The sums assessed against the parcels of property and the owners
thereof and interest thereon at the rate stated in the assessment ordinance,
together with reasonable attorney's fees and any costs of collection, are a
lien upon the parcels of property which are assessed and a personal liability
and charge against the real and true owners of such property, and the lien
shall be a first-enforceable lien thereon, superior to all other liens and
claims except those for State, County, School District and City ad valorem
taxes.
   b.   The sums so assessed against the abutting property and the owners
thereof shall be and become due and payable in five (5) equal installments, due
respectively on or before thirty (30) days, one year and thirty (30) days, two
(2) years and thirty (30) days, three (3) years and thirty (30) days, and four
(4) years and thirty (30) days from the date of such completion and acceptance
at the rate of interest stated in the assessment ordinance, payable annually
with each installment. The property owners and the Chief Financial Officer may
enter into pay arrangements providing for payment in monthly installments
bearing the same interest as provided by the assessment ordinance but also
providing for extended or different payment terms than those mentioned above.
Any owner has the right to pay the entire assessment or any installment thereof
before maturity by payment of principal and accrued interest. If default is
made in the payment of any installment of principal or interest promptly as the
same matures, then the entire amount of the assessment upon which such default
is made shall, at the option of the City or assigns, be and become immediately
due and payable and shall be collectible, together with reasonable attorney's
fees and costs of collection if incurred.
   c.   In cases where the adjacent property owner meets the income limits for
low to moderate income as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Developement, the City Council may approve the payment of the assessments over
a ten year period with no accrued interest for that particular property owner.
(Ord. No. 0-98-21; 3/18/98)
Sec. 2-72.   Delinquent collection.
   If default occurs in the payment of any assessment, collection thereof may
be enforced by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.  (Ord. No. 0-98-21;
3/18/98)
Sec. 2-73.   Certificates.
   a.   To provide proof of  the sums assessed against respective parcels of
abutting property and the owners thereof and the time and terms of payment and
to aid in the enforcement and collection thereof, assignable certificates will
be issued by the City. Following, the certificates shall be executed by the
City Chief Financial Officer and shall be payable to the City or assigns and
shall declare the amounts, time and terms of payment, rate of interest, and the
date of completion and acceptance of the improvements abutting upon such
property for which the certificate is issued. The certificate shall contain the
name of the owner(s) or owners, if known, description of the property by lot
and block number or front feet thereof, or such other description as may
identify the property.  If the property is owned by any estate, then it may be
identified in the certificate as being owned by the estate, or if the name of
the owner is unknown, then to so state will be sufficient. No error or mistake
in describing any property or in giving the name of the owner shall invalidate
or in anywise impair such certificate or the assessments levied.
   b.   The certificates shall provide substantially that if installment
payments are not paid promptly upon maturity, they shall be collectible with
reasonable attorney's fees and costs of collection if incurred. The amounts
evidenced by the certificates may be paid to the Chief Financial Officer, who
shall issue a receipt therefor which shall be evidence of such payment on any
demand.  The Chief Financial Officer shall deposit sums received immediately in
a separate fund.
   c.   The paving certificates shall further show whether the proceedings
leading up to the assessments to which the particular certificate relates have
been regularly held in compliance with the law and whether all prerequisites to
the fixing of the assessment lien against the property described in such
certificate and the personal liability of the owner(s)  thereof have been
performed. Such recitals shall be prima facie evidence of all the matters
recited in such certificates, and no further proof thereof shall be required in
any court.
   d.   It shall not be necessary that the recitals be in the exact form above
set forth, but the substance thereof shall be sufficient. The fact that
improvements may be omitted on any portion of a specific unit adjacent to any
premises exempt from the lien of such assessment shall not invalidate, affect
or impair the lien of such assessments upon other premises. (Ord. No. 0-98-21;
3/18/98)
Sec. 2-74.   Errors.
   Full power to make and levy reassessments and to correct mistakes, errors,
invalidities or irregularities, either in the assessments or in the
certificates issued in evidence thereof, is vested in the City.  (Ord. No. 0-
98- 21; 3/18/98)

Sec. 7-72. Options for Demolition or Rehabilitation of Substandard Buildings. 
Requirement to Return Substandard Building Disposition Form.
   a.   The Substandard Building Notice letter will set forth three options for
consideration as described below.  The owner/lienholders shall choose an option
and return the Substandard Building Disposition form within ten (10) days of
receipt of the Notice letter.
   b.   Option One: City of Tyler Voluntary Demolition Program. The Voluntary
Demolition Program exists to encourage owners that have a financial inability
to pay the costs of demolition to consent to the demolition and clearance of
substandard buildings which are not feasible for rehabilitation.  Under the
program, the City takes responsibility for all demolition and clearance
activities at no cost to participating owners.  The program encourages the
removal of deteriorated and dilapidated substandard buildings and encourages
new construction of affordable housing on appropriate lots.
   Requests to participate in the City of Tyler Voluntary Demolition Program
may be made either before or after the building has been identified as
substandard under this Article by filing an Application, an Affidavit of
Hardship and a Waiver and Release for Voluntary Demolition. Additional
documentation of financial inability to pay the costs of demolition may be
required to be submitted if requested by the Director.
   Applications may be picked up at and returned to the City of Tyler
Neighborhood Services Department.  Applications will also be included with
Notice of Substandard Building letters for those buildings tagged pursuant to
this Article.  In those cases, applications should be returned with the
Substandard Building Disposition Form.  The Director or designee shall process
all Applications and contact eligible parties regarding the scheduled date for
demolition.  (Ord. No. 0-2007-101, 8-22-07) (Ord. No. 2009-8, 2/11/09)
   c.   Option Two: Submit Rehabilitation Plan of Action and have public
hearing before the Neighborhood Revitalization Board or the Historical
Preservation Board and City Council, as applicable.  Owners/lienholders may
request time for rehabilitation by submitting to the Director a written
Rehabilitation Plan of Action within twenty five (25) days of receipt of the
Notice Letter. A completed Application for Certificate of Appropriateness for
Rehabilitation, forms of which are available from the City of Tyler Planning
and Zoning Department, must also be submitted if the property is a designated
historic landmark. The Plan and completed Application, if applicable, will be
submitted to the Neighborhood Services Department and then forwarded to the
City of Tyler Building Official for review before consideration by either the
Neighborhood Revitalization Board (NRB) (See Sec. 7-74) or the Historical
Preservation Board (HPB) (See Sec. 7-73).
   The Rehabilitation Plan of Action must include:  a detailed description of
the work required to render the building safe, sanitary and fit for human
habitation, occupancy, or use;  a reasonable time schedule for completion of
such repairs or demolition; and proof of financial resources available to
complete repairs.      (Ord. No. 0-2007-101, 8-22-07)
   d.   Option Three:  Owner demolition and clearance. 
      1.   The owner/lienholder may choose to demolish the substandard building
by obtaining the appropriate demolition permit from the City of Tyler Building
Inspection Department within thirty (30) days of receiving a written Notice to
Proceed from Director or receiving a Certificate of Demolition from the City
Council. 
      2.   No bond will be required if the owner/lienholder performs all
demolition; however, if the owner/lienholder hires a third-party contractor to
perform demolition and clearance activities, a performance or cash bond will be
required before a demolition permit may issue. The performance or cash bond
shall be conditioned upon the permittee performing the demolition in accordance
with permit instructions and removing all debris from the site prior to the
permit’s expiration date and the failure to do so may result in the application
of all or part of the bond proceeds to defray costs of project completion.
      3.   For good cause, the Building Official may extend the time limit of
the permit for up to thirty (30) days.  (Ord. No. 0-2007-101, 8-22-07) (Ord.

significance. 
      1.    If SHPO states the property may be of historical significance, or

has been otherwise identified by the City as being potentially historically
significant, then the Director will set a hearing before the City of Tyler
Historical Preservation Board (HPB) pursuant to Section

      2.   If SHPO states that the property has no historical significance and
the property has not been otherwise identified as potentially historically
significant by the City, then the Director shall issue either a Notice to
Proceed with Voluntary Demolition under the City’s Voluntary Demolition Program
or a Notice to Proceed with Demolition by Owner.  If the owner/lienholder has
requested rehabilitation and has timely submitted a Rehabilitation Plan of
Action, then the matter shall be set for public hearing before the City of
Tyler Neighborhood Revitalization Board (NRB).  Notice of the NRB public
hearing shall be sent to interested parties no later than ten (10) days prior
to the hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted
signature.
   b.   Owners/lienholders will be notified of the date and time of the HPB
public hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted
signature, at least ten (10) days prior.  If the owner/lienholder has requested
rehabilitation and properly submitted a Rehabilitation Plan of Action and
Application for Certificate of Appropriateness for Rehabilitation pursuant to
Section
10-23 and Section
7-73, the HPB will review that Plan and hear from the Building Official
regarding the sufficiency and economic feasibility of that Plan. The HPB will
determine whether to advise and recommend that the City Council issue either a
Certificate of Appropriateness for Rehabilitation, if requested and the Plan is
sufficient, or a Certificate of Demolition.
   c.   After the HPB public hearing, a second public hearing will be set
before the City Council.  City Council will make the final determination about
whether to order a Certificate of Demolition or a Certificate of
Appropriateness for Rehabilitation.  Owners/lienholders will be notified of the
date and time of the City Council meeting at least ten (10) days prior by
certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted signature. 
   d.   City Council decisions to issue Certificates of Appropriateness for
Rehabilitation or Demolition may be appealed to district court within 30 days
following the date a copy of the Order is personally delivered or is mailed
certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted signature to the owner,
lienholder, and/or mortgagee.
   e.   If a Certificate of Appropriateness for Rehabilitation is issued, the
project shall be monitored by the HPB. The Planning and Zoning Department shall
schedule additional HPB hearings as needed to review progress made in lieu of
the timetable established for project completion.  Notices for monitoring
hearings shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted
signature.

Legal Framework
Sec. 10-1.   Title
This chapter will be known and cited as the Unified Development Code (UDC) of

referring to the Unified Development Code. 
Sec. 10-2.   Legal Authority
   a.   Empowerment to Zone
      1.   The unified development code will be drawn with reasonable
consideration to the character of each district and its peculiar suitability
for particular uses and to encourage the most appropriate use of land.
      2.   The regulations in this code will be uniform throughout each
district for each class or kind of buildings or structures or uses of land, but
the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts.
   b.   Compliance
      All land, buildings, structures, or appurtenances located within the city
which are hereafter occupied, used, erected, altered, or converted, must be
used, placed, and erected in conformance with the development regulations
prescribed for the zoning district in which such land or building is located,
except where provided in this code.
   c.   Minimum Requirements
      The standards in this code are minimum requirements for the promotion of
the public safety, health, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and welfare of
those persons residing in or visiting the city. 
Sec. 10-3.   Relationship to Other Laws, Rules, and Requirements 
   a.   This code is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any
easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties. However, where this
code imposes a greater restriction upon the use or building height, or requires
larger open spaces than are required by other laws or parties, the provisions
of this code will apply.
   b.   The issuance of any permit, certificate, or approval in accordance with
the standards and requirements of this code does not relieve the recipient
responsibility of complying with all other applicable requirements.  In
interpreting and applying the provisions of this code, the provisions contained
herein will be held to be the minimum requirements.
Sec. 10-4.   Creation of Building Site
No permit for the construction of a building upon any tract or parcel within
the city may be issued by the building official unless the parcel or tract is
part of a plat of record, properly approved by the planning and zoning
commission, and filed in the Plat Records of Smith County, Texas. (0-2003-38,
7-23-03)
Sec. 10-5.   Certificate of Occupancy
No building hereafter erected, converted, or structurally altered may be used
or occupied and no land or building may be changed in use unless or until a
Certificate of Occupancy (CO) has been issued by the building official.  This
requirement does not apply to single-family attached, detached, or duplex
dwellings, or to the routine change of occupancy of individual dwelling units
in a multifamily apartment.
   a.   A CO will confirm that the building or proposed use of land or building
complies with all City Building and Health Codes and ordinances.
   b.   A CO must be applied for coincident with the application for a building
permit and will be issued after the completion of the erection or alteration of
such building or land provided such construction has been made in complete
conformity to this ordinance.
Sec. 10-6.   Classification of Unlisted Uses
   a.   Classification
      When uses of land, buildings or other structures arise that have not been
classified in this code, the planning director will make an administrative
decision as to the appropriate use category and zoning district(s) in which it
will be allowed.
   b.   Appeals
      The decision of the planning director concerning the appropriate district
for an unlisted use may be appealed to the zoning board of adjustment pursuant

Sec. 10-11.   Zoning Map
   a.   The boundaries of the zoning districts are hereby established and shown
on a map designated as the City of Tyler Zoning Map.

residential use; for office, limited commercial or educational use; for
commercial, mixed use or educational, industrial/manufacturing use.
   c.   The use and area regulations shall be uniform in each individual zoning
district, and shall be classified.
   d.   The map and all notations, references, and other information shown
thereon are a part of this development code and will have the same force and

original record and must not be changed in any manner.
      2.   One copy must be filed with and maintained by the planning
department, which must post all changes and subsequent amendments for public
observation and for the issuance of building permits.
      3.   Reproductions for informational purposes may from time-to-time be
made of the official zoning map.
      4.   Any person aggrieved or affected by any amendments made to the
adopted zoning map may appeal the revision by filing a request for rezoning

   f.   Zoning District Boundaries
      1.   The following guidelines must be observed in preparing the zoning
map and in making any changes to the district boundaries.
      2.   Where the districts designated on the map are bounded by a street,
alley, or lot line, the boundary of the district will be the center line of the
street, alley, or lot line unless otherwise indicated on the map. 
      3.   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries as shown on the
official zoning map, the following rules will apply:
         (a)   Boundaries indicated as following a railroad line or right-of-
way, will be deemed to be located midway between the main tracks of the
railroad line, or in the middle of the right-of-way.
         (b)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the city limits,
will be construed as following the city limits.
         (c)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline
of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water, will be construed
as following such centerline.
      4.   Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated, and where
the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the
district boundaries will be construed to be property lines; and where the
districts designated on the map are bounded approximately by lot lines, the lot
line, not to exceed a distance of 25 feet, will be construed to be the boundary
of the district.
      5.   In the case of a district boundary line dividing a property into two
parts, the district boundary line, not to exceed a distance of 25 feet, will be
construed to be the property line nearest the least restricted district.
      6.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features
indicated in the paragraph above will be so construed.  Distances not
specifically indicated on the original zoning map will be determined by the
scale of the map or by dimensions.
      7.   Where physical features, such as streets, railroad lines, rivers,
streams and such, existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on
the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered above, the
planning director must make a written interpretation of the District
boundaries. (Ord. No. 0-2010-20, 3/10/10)
      8.   Whenever a street or alley is vacated, adjacent districts will
extend to the center line of the vacated street or alley right-of-way. (ORD. 0-
97-62, 12/10/97)(ORD. 0-98-68, 8/26/98)
Sec. 10-12.   Legal Nonconforming Lot
   a.   A “legal nonconforming lot” is a tract-of-record lot, which was platted
prior to the adoption of an otherwise applicable zoning ordinance that fails to
meet the lot area or lot width standards of that ordinance.
   b.   For the purposes of zoning compliance review, any legal nonconforming
lot as defined by this chapter, in separate ownership, and not of contiguous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership, may be used as a building site
even though it has neither sufficient land to conform to the minimum lot area
requirements nor sufficient lot width to conform to the minimum lot width
requirements of the district.  A legal nonconforming lot that does not meet lot
area or lot width requirements must still meet the other requirements of the
district.
DIVISION B.
Transitional Provisions
Sec. 10-13.   Applications Submitted Before [April 24, 2008]
Complete applications that are pending approval before April 24, 2008 may be
reviewed and approved in accordance with the applicable zoning or subdivision
ordinances in effect before April 24, 2008. All development applications
submitted on or after April 24, 2008 must be reviewed under the terms of this
development code.
Sec. 10-14.   Buildings Approved or Under Construction
Nothing in this code will require any change in the plans, construction, or
designated use of a building under construction and scheduled to be completed
within one year of the date of passage of this code, nor will it require any
change in plans, construction, or designated use of a building or other
structure for which a building permit has been issued within six months after
the effective date of this code, provided construction is started within sixty
days of the effective date of this code.
Sec. 10-15.   Permits issued before [April 24, 2008]
Any building, development, or structure for which a final building permit was
issued before April 24, 2008 may be completed in conformance with the issued
building permit and other applicable permits and conditions, even if such
building, development, or structure does not fully comply with provisions of
this development code. If building is not commenced and diligently pursued
within the time allowed under the original permit or any extension granted,
then the building, development or structure must be constructed, completed, and
occupied only in strict compliance with the standards of this development code.
Sec. 10-16.   Violations Continue
Any violation of the previous ordinances will continue to be a violation under
this development code and be subject to penalties and enforcement under
Article X, Division B. If the use, development, construction or other activity
that was a violation under the previous ordinances complies with the express
terms of this development code, enforcement action will cease, except to the
extent of collecting penalties for violations that occurred before the
effective date of this code. The adoption of this development code does not
affect nor prevent any pending or future prosecution of, or action to abate,
violations of the previous ordinances that occurred before April 24, 2008.
Sec. 10-17.   Nonconformities
Any nonconformity under previous zoning and subdivision ordinances will also be
a nonconformity under this development code, as long as the situation that
resulted in the nonconforming status under the previous regulation continues to
exist. If, however, a nonconforming situation under previous zoning and
subdivision ordinance becomes conforming because of the adoption of this code ,
or any subsequent amendment to it, then the situation will no longer be
considered a nonconformity.

   i.   PUR Planned Unit Residential
      The PUR district is primarily for the medium to high density development
of unique and innovative forms of detached or attached single-family housing . 
A PUR development utilizes the total space within a development by creating
common open spaces, scenic and recreational areas, and other spaces, which will
compensate for the reduction of land area dedicated for the residential
structure.
      It is the intent of the PUR to provide for residential developments which
may utilize private streets, owned and maintained by a Homeowners Association,
or dedicated public streets.  The PUR district is not intended as a convenience
to circumventing regulations set forth in other residential districts, or as a
tool for mass variance, without provisions of common areas. (Ord. No. 0-2014-

high-density development of condominiums, apartments, and nursing homes.  A PMF
development may include common open spaces, scenic and recreational areas.  The
PMF district is not intended as a convenience to circumvent regulations set
forth in other residential districts or a a tool for mass variance.  (Ord. No
0-2010-119, 11/10/10) (Ord. 0-2011-45, 6/8/11) (Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19
   k.   NR Neighborhood Residential
      The NR district is primarily intended to accommodate small scale single-
family attached or detached dwellings on one lot or individually platted lots

PCD          Planned Commercial District
 
Sec. 10-25.   District Purpose Statements
   a.   C-1 Light Commercial District
      The C-1 district is primarily intended to provide for commercial
development and business activities that are located at the edge of residential
areas but which serve an area larger than nearby neighborhoods.  Areas zoned C-
1 district must be restricted to commercial activities, primarily if not
exclusively conducted indoors, with limited or no outdoor display or storage of
merchandise.
   b.   C-2 General Commercial District
      The C-2 district is primarily intended for heavier commercial development
that serves a citywide and regional market area, and for establishments
requiring outdoor display and storage of merchandise. 
   c.   DBAC Downtown Business, Arts, and Culture District
      The DBAC district (formerly C-3) is primarily intended to implement the
Tyler 1st Comprehensive Plan,
Chapter 4, Downtown Master Plan by accommodating development and redevelopment
in downtown that creates a walkable, mixed-use city center with residential,
commercial, entertainment, arts, institutional, park, and government land uses,
and by establishing guidelines and controls for the development and
redevelopment of the downtown area, shown on the Future Land Use Guide, with a
mix of commercial, residential,  cultural, office, and existing light
manufacturing uses. The district is further intended to ensure that future
development is compatible with the existing development and will enhance the
economic, cultural, and historical significance of downtown Tyler. The
voluntary preferred design guidelines are kept on file in the planning
department. (Ord. No. 0-2014-33; 4/23/14)
   d.   PMXD-1 Planned Mixed-Use District-1
      The PMXD-1 district is primarily intended to implement the Tyler 1st
Comprehensive Plan by promoting a mix of residential, retail and service,
office, institutional, park, and government uses.  The PMXD-1 district is
intended to be applied in areas designated for medium density mixed-use on the
Future Land Use Guide, namely at or near key intersections of major arterial
roadways, and other areas with access to a full range of public facilities and
infrastructure. (Ord. No. 0-2014-33; 4/23/14)
   The PMXD-1 district is further intended to promote the following objectives:
      1.   Create new compact, medium-density development and redevelopment
patterns that provide a mix of residential and non-residential uses in the same
building or in close proximity to enhance opportunities for residents to live,
work, shop and enjoy leisure within a walkable, urban village environment.
      2.   Provide more opportunities to drive less and thereby reduce the
growth rate of traffic congestion.
      3.   Ensure appropriate transitions between mixed-use districts and
single-family residential neighborhoods.
      4.   Improve access management on arterial and collector roads in order
to enhance traffic function.
      5.   Improve the aesthetic appearance of arterial and collector roads.
      All developments created in a PMXD-1 district must be designed and
developed in accordance with an approved site development plan or a written
narrative detailing the development parameters of sufficient detail that it can
be evaluated and submitted for approval to the Planning Commission and City
Council.  Where narrative is submitted and approved by the City Council, future
site plans may be approved by staff when they are consistent with the standards
included in the narrative.  The district is not intended as a convenience to
circumvent regulations set forth in other commercial or residential districts
or as a tool for mass variance.  (Ord. No 0-2010-119, 11/10/10)
   e.   PMXD-2 Planned Mixed Use District-2 
      The PMXD-2 district is primarily intended to implement the Tyler 1st
Comprehensive Plan by accommodating a combination of high-density office,
institutional, retail and service, and residential uses at a maximum density of
50 units per acre that function as a center of economic activity for residents
of Tyler, Smith County, and the East Texas region.  The PMXD-2 district is
intended to be applied in areas designated for high density, mixed-use
development on the Future Land Use Guide, namely at or near key intersections
of major arterial roadways and in the city center.  The PMXD-2 district is
further intended to promote the same objectives of the PMXD-1 district listed
in Sec. 10-25(d) above, and to also create sufficient residential and
employment density within half-mile centers to be "transit-ready" for location
of potential future public transit.(Ord. No. 0-2014-33; 4/23/14) (Ord. No. O-
2018-17; 2/14/18)
      All developments created in a PMXD-2 district must be designed and
developed in accordance with an approved site development plan or a written
narrative detailing the development parameters of sufficient detail that it can
be evaluated and submitted for approval to the Planning Commission and City
Council.  Where narrative is submitted and approved by the City Council, future
site plans may be approved by staff when they are consistent with the standards
included in the narrative.  The district is not intended as a convenience to
circumventing regulations set forth in other commercial or residential
districts or as a tool for mass variance. A density bonus may be granted with a
developer's agreement subject to approval from City Council (Ord. No. 0-2010-
119; 11/10/10) (Ord. No. O-2018-17; 2/14/18)
   f.   PCD Planned Commercial Development District
      The purpose of the PCD district is to provide for the development of
planned commercial facilities.  The PCD district will be designated where
retail and commercial facilities are needed throughout the city.  All
developments created in a PCD district must be designed and developed as a unit
according to an approved site development plan.  The district is not intended
as a convenience to circumvent regulations set forth in other commercial or
residential districts or as a tool for mass variance.  (Ord. No 0-2010-119, 11/

protect agricultural uses until urbanization is warranted and the appropriate
change in district classification is determined.
   b.   AR Adaptive Reuse District
      The AR district is primarily intended to allow for the rehabilitation and
reuse of residential buildings and other structures that are generally within
but not exclusively, historic residential neighborhoods and the streets that
form the boundary of such districts. The district provides property owners with
the flexibility to use older homes for low-intensity commercial or office
activities without detracting from the essential residential character of the
area, nor allowing a proliferation of heavier commercial uses. 
   c.   RPO Restricted Professional Office District
      The RPO district is primarily intended to accommodate office uses that
serve as a buffer between commercial and residential areas.  It is also
intended to facilitate the conversion of residential properties that are

between the "POD" development and the close-by residential areas.  The owner
shall submit a plan for the use and development of all or part of such tract of
land to the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council. Any
significant change in the site development plan requires approval of the
Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council through a public hearing
process.  The plan for the proposed development must present a unified and
organized arrangement of buildings and service facilities, such that a
functional relationship within the property is achieved.  The arrangement of
buildings and service facilities shall not adversely affect the use of
properties immediately adjacent to the development.  Reasonable additional
requirements as to landscaping, lighting, signs or other advertising devices,
screening, access ways, building setbacks, and height and area limitations may
be imposed by the Planning and Zoning Commission for the protection of the
adjoining property.
   e.   MU- O Municipal Use Overlay District
      The Municipal Use category is available for all land owned by the City of
Tyler that is used for municipal purposes.  Traditionally all land uses related
to a municipal purpose were allowed on land owned by the city and city owned
land could be and was zoned in any category because all municipal purpose uses
were allowed through the Use Chart. The purpose of this new category is to
identify on the Zoning Map all of those tracts which are owned by the City and
which are used for municipal purposes.
   f.       INT Institutional District
T      he purpose of the INT district is to provide for the development and
regulation of medical facilities and hospitals, public buildings, religious
institutions, as well as educational facilities and all related and accessory

Land Use Guide.  (Ord. No. 0-2014-33; 4/23/14)
   h.    CC-O Commercial Corridor Overlay District
      The CC-O district is primarily intended to improve the aesthetic
environment of the city’s major commercial streets and arterial corridors
through a process of redevelopment and reuse of private property by private
interests and public infrastructure improvements in the public right-of-way. 
The CC-O district is further intended to:
      1.   Support, higher density, pedestrian- and transit-friendly
development near intersections of major arterial streets, highways, and
gateways to the City of Tyler.
      2.   Encourage infill and redevelopment that is compatible with the

Use Table Overview Business Districtsallowed usesResidential Districtsallowed
usesIndustrial Districtsallowed usesAgricultural Districtallowed usesUse Table
Sec. 10-40.   Use Groups
The use table classifies land uses into five major groupings: Residential,
Public and Civic, Commercial, Industrial, Agricultural, and Other.  These are
referred to as “Use Groups.”
Sec. 10-41.   Use Categories and Standards
Each use group is further divided into “Use Categories.”  These categories
classify land uses based on common characteristics, such as the type of
products sold, site conditions, or the amount of activity on the site.  The
“Use Standard” column in the use table provides a cross-reference to additional
standards that apply to some uses, whether or not they are allowed as a
permitted use or special use. 
Sec. 10-42.   Determination of Use Category
When a land use cannot be classified into a Use Category or appears to fit into
multiple categories, the planning director is authorized to determine the most
appropriate Use Category.
Sec. 10-43.   Permitted Uses
Uses identified with an “X” in the use table are permitted by-right in the
designated zoning districts, subject to compliance with all other applicable
provisions of this chapter.
Sec. 10-44.   Planned Uses
Uses identified with a “P” in the use table require a site development plan.
Development is to be consistent with the approved site development plan.  If
the property is undeveloped, any proposed use shall be consistent with design
parameters approved with the zone change.
Sec. 10-45.   Special Uses
Uses identified with an “S” in the use table may be allowed in the designated
zoning districts if approved in accordance with the special use approval
procedure in
Article IX, Division A.  Approved special uses are subject to compliance with
all other applicable provisions of this chapter.
Sec. 10-46.   Temporary Uses
Uses identified with a “T” in the use table are uses that require a temporary
use permit pursuant to
Article IX, Division B.
Sec. 10-47.   Prohibited Uses
Uses that have no letter associated with them in the uses table are expressly
prohibited.  Uses not listed in the use table are also prohibited.

Sec. 10-70.   Television Satellite Dish Regulations
   a.   Purpose
To provide for installation of satellite dish antennas greater than three feet
in diameter designed or used for reception of television or other electronic
communications broadcast or relayed from an earth satellite.
   b.   Required Conditions
      1.   Administrative approval of site plan by a building official.

Sec. 10-71.   Sexually Oriented Businesses
   a.   Purpose and Limitations
      1.   It is the purpose of this section to regulate sexually oriented
businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and welfare of city citizens,
and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations.
      2.   These regulations prevent concentration of sexually oriented
businesses within the city and prevent the establishment of these types of
businesses near sensitive areas. 
      3.   The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect
of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent or effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market.
      4.   It is not the intent or effect of this ordinance to determine which
sexually oriented materials constitute obscenity.  By issuing a sexually
oriented business license pursuant to this section, the City of Tyler does not
warrant in any way that the operator of the business is in compliance with, or
will remain in compliance with, state laws regulating obscenity.  Obscenity is
determined by the specific provisions of Texas Penal Code Chapter 43 or
successor, and by local community standards.  Obscenity is not determined by
the city of Tyler or by this ordinance.  In issuing a sexually oriented
business license, the city only warrants that, at the time of issuance, the
operator is in compliance with the minimum requirements of city building,
zoning, fire, and health ordinances.
      5.   The city council finds that sexually oriented businesses, because of
their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses
around them and surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing
increased crime and the downgrading of property values. Numerous studies,
reports, and findings concerning the harmful effects of sexually oriented
businesses on surrounding land uses and neighborhoods have been produced and
reviewed, including studies from Abilene and Dallas, Texas.
      6.   It is the intent of the city council that the locational regulations
of this section are promulgated pursuant to the Chapter 243, Texas Local
Government Code, or successor statute (Ord. No. 0-99-48, 7/7/99)
   b.   Classification
Sexually oriented businesses are classified as follows:
      1.   Adult arcades;
      2.   Adult bookstores or adult video stores;
      3.   Adult cabarets;
      4.   Adult motels;
      5.   Adult motion picture theaters;
      6.   Adult theaters;
      7.   Escort agencies;
      8.   Nude model studios; and
      9.   Sexual encounter centers.
   c.   License Required
      1.   It is illegal to operate a sexually oriented business without a
valid license, issued by the city for the particular type of business.
      2.   An application for a license must be made on a form provided by the
planning department. The application must be accompanied by a sketch or diagram
showing the configuration of the premises, including a statement of total floor
space occupied by the business. The sketch or diagram need not be
professionally prepared but must be drawn to a designated scale or drawn with
marked dimensions of the interior of the premises to an accuracy of plus or
minus six inches. Applicants who must comply with subpart Q "Additional
Regulations Pertaining to Exhibition of Sexually Explicit Films and Videos" of
this section shall submit a diagram meeting those requirements.
      3.   The applicant must be qualified according to this ordinance and the
premises must be inspected and found to be in compliance with the law by the
health district, fire department, and building official.
      4.   A person who wishes to operate a sexually oriented business and who
is an individual, must sign the application for a license as applicant. If a
person who wishes to operate a sexually oriented business is other than an
individual, each individual who has a 20% or greater interest in the business
must sign the application for a license as applicant. Each applicant must be
qualified as required herein and each applicant shall be considered a licensee
if a license is granted.
   d.   Issuance of License
The building official will approve the issuance of a license to an applicant
within 30 days after receipt of an application unless the applicant:
      1.   Is under 18 years of age.
      2.   Or spouse is overdue in payment to the city of taxes, fees, fines or
penalties assessed against applicant or imposed upon spouse.
      3.   Has failed to provide information reasonably necessary for issuance

granted a license if at least 90 days have elapsed since the date denial became
final.
   h.   Suspension
      The building official will suspend a license for a period not to exceed

suspending or revoking a license until the zoning board of adjustment makes a
final decision.
   k.   Transfer of license

         (a)   A religious institution;
         (b)   A public or private elementary or secondary school;

this section; or
         (e)   The property line of a lot devoted to a residential use as

intervening structures or objects, from the nearest portion of the building or
structure used as part of the premises where a sexually oriented business is
conducted, to the nearest property line of the premises of a religious
institution or public or private elementary or secondary school, or to the
nearest boundary of an affected public park, residential district or
residential lot.
      4.   The operation, establishment, substantial enlargement, or transfer
of ownership or control of a sexually oriented business within 1,000 feet of
another sexually oriented business is prohibited. The distance between any two
sexually oriented businesses must be measured in a straight line, without
regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest exterior wall of
the structure in which each business is located.
      5.   Any sexually oriented business lawfully operating on the date of
enactment of this ordinance that is in violation of this section will be deemed
a nonconforming use. The nonconforming use will be permitted to continue for a
period not to exceed three years, unless sooner terminated for any reason or
voluntarily discontinued for a period of 30 days or more. Such nonconforming
uses must not be increased, enlarged, extended, or altered except that the use
may be changed to a conforming use. If two or more sexually oriented businesses
are within 1,000 feet of one another and otherwise in a permissible location
the sexually oriented business which was first established and continually
operating at a particular location is the conforming use and the later-
established business(es) is nonconforming.
      6.   A sexually oriented business lawfully operating as a conforming use
is not rendered a nonconforming use by the location, subsequent to the grant or
renewal of the sexually oriented business license, of a religious institution,
public or private elementary or secondary school, public park, residential
district or residential lot within 800 feet of the sexually oriented business.
This provision applies only to renewal of a valid license, and does not apply
when an application for a license is submitted after a license has expired or
has been revoked.

      2.   It is illegal for the person in control of a sleeping room in a
hotel, motel, or similar commercial establishment that does not have a sexually
oriented business license to rent or sub-rent a sleeping room to a person and,

Subdivisions
Sec. 10-100.   Purpose
This Article sets out the procedure and standards for submitting plats, for
subdividing property, for the layout and development of lots, land and
subdivisions within the city limits and within Zone 2 of the extraterritorial
jurisdiction, and to guide and assist developers in correct procedures to be
followed and to furnish information of standards required. This Article is also
intended to promote the safe, orderly, and healthful development of the city by
controlling the location, width, design, and type of streets, sidewalks, storm
sewers, culverts, bridges, utilities, and essential services required. (Ord.
No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-2000) (Ord. No. 0-2003-50; 9/24/03)
Sec. 10-101.   Applicability
   a.   Except as otherwise provided, these regulationsapply to all
subdivisions of land, located within both the City limits and within the City's
extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
   b.   The following types of subdivision do not require approval by the
City.  However, the City will not extend utilities, or issue building permits
for the development of any property which has not received final plat approval,
except as otherwise provided by this code.
      1.   The division of land into parts greater than five acres, where each
part has access and no required public improvement is to be dedicated
      2.   The creation of a remainder of a tract caused by the platting of a
portion of the tract, provided the remainder is larger than five acres and
subject to the following criteria.
         a. A valid preliminary plat must be approved for the development.
         b. The calculation of a remainder area(s) will be determined by the
contiguous amount of unplatted developable land.
         c. Floodplain areas identified on the preliminary plat are not
required to be included on a final plat and may not be considered part of the
remainder area calculation. In the case a proposed street shown on the
preliminary plat or Master Street Plan is adjacent to or crosses a floodplain
area, the right-of-way for the street must be dedicated in accordance to the
phasing plan on the preliminary plat.
         d. Any area of land required to be dedicated as Master Street Plan
right-of-way or is proposed to remain undevelopable may not be considered part
of the remainder area calculation.
         e. In no case shall a final plat exclude land so as to leave a
remainder or portion of a remainder of such size, shape, or location as not to
be developable in accordance with the requirements of the Subdivision
ordinance, Sec. 10-165 pertaining to reserve strips, or any other section of
this ordinance. (Ord. No. 0-2017-100; 11/8/17)
      3.   The creation of a leasehold for agricultural use of the subject
property, provided that the use does not involve the construction of a building
(s) to be used as a residence or for any purpose not directly related to
agricultural use of the land or crops or livestock raised thereon.
      4.   The division of property through inheritance, the probate of an
estate, or by a court of law.
   c.   Except as provided above, no land may be subdivided or platted through
the use of any legal description other than in accordance with a plat approved
by the planning and zoning commission in accordance with these regulations.
   d.   No building permit or certificate of occupancy will be issued for any
parcel or tract of land inside the city limits until such property has received
final plat approval and is in substantial conformity with these subdivision
regulations, and no private improvements may take place or be commenced except
in conformity with these regulations. (Ord. No. 0-2017-100; 11/8/17)
   e.   Land within an industrial park may be subdivided by metes and bounds
unless such division includes the planning or development of a new street or
access easement, floodway easement, or extension of city owned water and/or
sewer mains to serve the property. Such development must conform to all other
rules and regulations set forth herein. (Ord. No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-2000)
Sec. 10-102.   General Requirements for Public Improvements
   a.   Plats Straddling Municipal Boundaries
      Whenever access to the subdivision or addition is required across land in
another municipality, the development services engineer may request assurance
from that municipality's Attorney that access is legally established, and from
its engineer that the access road is adequately improved, or that a bond has
been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the construction of
the access road.  In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross
municipal or county boundary lines.
   b.   Character of the Land
      Land that is unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding,
utility easements, or other features which will reasonably be harmful to the
safety, health, and welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the
subdivision or addition and/or welfare of its surrounding areas, must not be
subdivided or platted unless adequate methods are formulated by the owner and
accepted by the development services engineer.
   c.   Adequate Public Facilities Policy
      The land proposed for subdivision must be adequately served by essential
facilities and services.  Design of improvements must conform to the Design
Guidelines for Subdivision Improvements. These services include street access,
water, waste water disposal, and off-site drainage.  No plat or replat may be
approved unless it conforms to this policy and its standards.  This policy may
be further defined and supplemented by other city ordinances. 
      1.   Access
         All platted lots must have safe and reliable access for daily use and
emergency purposes.
         (a)   Safe and reliable access to platted lots must be provided via an
improved public street, private street, or an approved private way, and
connected by improved public streets to an improved public thoroughfare. (Ord.
No. 0-2014-97; 10/22/14)
         (b)   All subdivisions must have adequately designed access or
approach as approved by the development services engineer.  Where development
phasing or constraints of the land prevent the provision of a second, separate
means of access, the city may accept a temporary street connection, or a median
divided street or entry to satisfy this requirement.
      2.   Water
         All platted lots must be connected to a state approved water system.
         (a)   Except for lots along an approved cul-de-sac, all lots within
the city limits and as appropriate in the ETJ must be provided service
connections in accordance with City of Tyler utility standards and TCEQ
regulations.
         (b)   Water service must be sufficient to meet the fire flow
requirements of the proposed development, except where a suitable alternative
means of fire protection is approved by the city fire chief.
         (c)   The city may accept development phasing, development
restrictions, and/or the construction of improvements to maintain adequate fire
protection.
      3.   Waste Water
         All platted lots must be served by an approved means of waste water
collection and treatment.
         (a)   On-site waste water treatment systems will not be permitted,
except for the pretreatment of industrial waste, unless approved by Tyler Water
Utilities.
         (b)   The projected waste water discharge of a proposed development
must not exceed the capacity of the waste water system.
         (c)   The city may accept the phasing of development and/or
improvements to the systems so as to maintain adequate waste water capacity.
         (d)   Where off-lot sewerage is not required or is not to be provided,
on-site sanitary sewer facilities must be in accordance with Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality rules as codified in Title 30, Texas Administrative
Code, Chapter 285, (effective August 3, 2006) or as amended, and as approved by
the On-Site Sewage Facility Designated Representative of Smith County.
         (e)   The developer of a subdivision in Zone 2 of the extraterritorial
jurisdiction must obtain from a Smith County-designated agent a letter
indicating whether or not the subdivision complies with the requirements of
Texas Health and Safety Code Chapter 366, and Title 30 Texas Administrative
Code Chapter 285, and Title 30 Subchapters A and G, Licenses and
Responsibilities.
      4.   Drainage
         Increased stormwater runoff attributable to new development must not
exceed the capacity of the downstream drainage system or adversely affect
adjoining or downstream property.  Where the projected runoff would exceed
capacity, the city may accept the phasing of development, the use of control
methods such as retention or detention, and/or the construction of off-site
drainage improvements as means of mitigation.
Sec. 10-103.   Apportionment of Municipal Infrastructure Costs
a.   General
 
Developers are required to bear the entire cost to design, construct, and
install the minimum infrastructure required to service their development.
Infrastructure improvements exceeding the minimum requirements to serve the
property that are requested by the City as an exaction for development must be
roughly proportional to the impact of the development. The required public
improvements will be determined by the developer's professional engineer and
approved by a professional engineer retained by the City of Tyler.
 
b.   Determination
 
Rough proportionality shall be determined by comparing the additional amount of
traffic capacity which will be supplied to the transportation network by the
requested infrastructure improvements to the number of vehicle trips created by
the proposed development.  If the traffic demand created by the proposed
development is roughly equal to or greater than the increase in traffic
capacity supplied by the requested improvements, then the improvements are
proportional. 
 
c.   Supply Calculation

To calculate the supply being added to the transportation network by the
requested improvements, the length of the street adjacent to the subdivision
(in miles) is multiplied by the number of additional lanes being added to the
system and multiplied by the traffic capacity which the lane can carry. The
length of street adjacent to a subdivision shall be determined by a survey
provided by the owner. The number of lanes required for a street shall be based
on the adopted Master Street Plan. When the Master Street Plan calls for wider
lanes than the minimum requirement according to Sec 10-155, the number of
additional lanes used for the supply calculation shall be the difference
between the minimum and Master Street Plan widths divided by the width of a
single lane.

IMAGES/0-0-0-130808.png]
If additional street width is constructed to allow for on street parking, the
developer may get credit for an additional lane of traffic provided that the
additional street width is at least nine feet wider than the minimum required
street width. The capacity of a street is also based on the street's
designation in the Master Street Plan. Table 10-103a lists the capacities for
different street designations. (Ord. No. O-2018-17; 2/14/18)

       (vehicle-miles/lane-mile)        (vehicle-miles)
 
d.   Demand Calculation

To calculate the demand created by a site, the peak hour traffic generated by
the site is multiplied by the average trip length.  According to the latest
Tyler and Smith County Texas travel surveys, the average trip length for Tyler/
Smith County is 6.1 miles.  Many of Tyler's arterial roads are state highways
which are maintained by TxDOT. For the proportionality calculation, only
impacts to City maintained roads will be considered. To solely account for
impacts to the City transportation network, the trip length has been reduced to
1.5 miles. The traffic generated by a site varies based on the use of the
land.  The peak hour traffic values for different uses are listed in Table 10-
103b.

Sec. 10-104.   Waiver of Development Exactions
A property owner or applicant for preliminary or final plat approval may file a
petition for relief from a dedication or construction requirement that is
applied or imposed as a condition of approval of a preliminary plat, or final
plat. The procedures for filing such a waiver are set forth in this code.
   a.   Petition for Relief
      The property owner or applicant must submit a written petition for relief
to the Planning Department at least 10 days prior to the Planning and Zoning
Commission's consideration of the plat. The petition must list the reasons for
the waiver request and must indicate the dedication and/or construction
requirements for which relief is being requested.

   An applicant may also submit a petition for relief from conditions of plat
approval added by the Commission in its consideration of a plat. This petition
must be submitted no later than 10 days following the commission's action.
   b.   Consideration of Plat
      After receipt of a petition for relief, the Planning Department will
schedule consideration of the plat together with development exaction waiver
within the 30-day time frame required by state law.
   c.   Study Required
      The petitioner must provide a study in support of the petition at the
time the written petition is filed. The Planning Director may extend the time
for submitting the study upon the request of the applicant. The study must
include the following information:
      1.   Total capacity of the City's public infrastructure system or
improvements to be dedicated to the City to be utilized by the proposed
subdivision, employing standard measures of capacity and equivalency tables
that relate to the type of development proposed to the quantity of system
capacity. In no case may the calculation of the capacity used by a proposed
commercial or multifamily development be based on development intensities less
than the mid-point of intensity allowed by the particular zoning for the
property or the specific use being sought. If the proposed subdivision is to be
developed in phases, such information must be provided for the entire
development, including any phases already developed.
      2.   Total capacity to be supplied to the City's public infrastructure
system by the proposed dedication of an interest in land or construction of
capital improvements. If the development application is part of a phased
development, the information must include any capacity supplied by prior
dedications or construction of capital improvements.
      3.   Comparison of the capacity of the City's public facilities system to
be consumed by the proposed subdivision with the capacity to be supplied by the
proposed dedication of an interest in land or construction of capital
improvements. In making this comparison, the impacts on the City's public
facilities system from the entire development will be considered.
      4.   The effect of any City participation in the costs of oversizing the
capital improvements to be constructed in accordance with the City's
requirements.
   d.   Processing of Petition
      The Engineering Department will evaluate the petition and supporting
study and make a recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission based
upon the petitioner's study and his/her own analysis. Engineering may use any
reasonable methodology and information in evaluating the petitioner's study. 
In making a recommendation based on the study the following criteria will be
considered:
         -Neighborhood Connectivity and street network
         -Drainage
         -Topography
         -Continuity of neighborhood design
         -Access
         -Street alignment
         -Possible resubdivision of remainder
   e.   Consideration of Petition for Relief
      The petition for relief will be considered by the Planning and Zoning
Commission when the plat is considered. Based upon the application, supporting
study and Engineering's report, the Commission will determine whether the
application of the regulations for dedication or public improvements is roughly
proportional to the nature and impact created by the development. The Planning
and Zoning Commission will take one of the following actions in considering the
petition for relief:
      1.    Deny the petition for relief, and impose the standard or condition
requiring dedication or construction of capital improvements in accordance with
the regulations contained within this ordinance.
      2.    Recommend to City Council approval of the petition for relief, in
whole or in part, for any dedication or construction requirement necessary to
meet the criteria for final approval.
      3.    Accept alternative designs for the public infrastructure system or
improvements to be dedicated to the City.
      4.    Delay the imposition of the requirement until a future phase of
development. If a delay is granted, the future phase of development must be
clearly defined. (Ord No. 0-2011-45, 6/8/11)
   f.   Criteria for Approval
      The City Council will determine whether the application of the
regulations requiring dedication of an interest in land for public improvements
or construction of capital improvements is roughly proportional to the nature
and extent of the impacts created by the proposed development on such water,
wastewater, roadway, or drainage system, and reasonably benefits the
development. The Council will take into account the evidence submitted by the
petitioner and Engineering's report and recommendation. (Ord. 0-2012-38, 4/25/
12)
   g.   Appeals
      The decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission on a petition for
relief may be appealed in accordance with Article VIII of this code. An appeal
constitutes authorization for the plat to also be placed on the City Council's
agenda for consideration and action.
   h.   Lapse of Plat Approval
      If relief is granted to the petitioner, it will remain in effect for the
time period specified for each type of plat, and will end upon expiration of
the plat. 
   i.   Plat Modification
      If a plat for which relief was granted is modified to increase the number
of residential units or the intensity of nonresidential uses, Engineering may
require a new study to validate the relief. The petition for relief and new
study must be submitted and processed according to the procedures outlined
above. (Ord. No. O-2018-17; 2/14/18)
Sec. 10-105.   Subdivision Name
      The proposed name of the subdivision or addition must not duplicate, or
too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision or
addition in the area covered by these regulations and must, where possible,
correspond to named subdivisions or additions in the immediate vicinity.  The
planning and zoning commission will have final authority to approve the name of
the subdivision or addition.
Sec. 10-106.   Corner and Reference Markers
      1.   All lot corners will be located and marked with minimum ½- inch
reinforcing bar, minimum 24 inches in length, and will be placed flush with the
ground or counter sunk, if necessary, in order to avoid being disturbed.
      2.   Iron rods, minimum ½ inch in diameter and minimum 24 inches long,
will be placed on all boundary corners, block corners, curve points, and angle
points in public rights-of-way.  Monuments will be located as required by the
Texas Board of Professional Surveyors and will be located along all drainage/
floodway boundaries at all curve points, angle points and at least one monument
at lot corners.  One monument may serve two lots if located at a common corner.
Sec. 10-107 - 109.   Reserved
DIVISION B.
Lot and Block Design Standards
Sec. 10-110.   Lot Arrangement
The lot arrangement must be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing
building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the unified
development code, building code and other applicable ordinances, laws, and
regulations. 
Sec. 10-111.   Driveways
Driveway access must be provided to buildings on the lots from an approved
street, alley, or private way. (Ord. No. 0-2014-97; 10/22/14)
Sec. 10-112.   Lot Dimensions
Lot dimensions must comply with the minimum standards of the unified
development code.  In general, side lot lines must be at right angles to street
lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule
will give a better street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots must be large
enough to allow for erection of buildings.  Depth and width of properties
reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or industrial purposes must be
adequate to provide for the off-street parking, landscaping, and loading
facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as
established in the unified development code.
Sec. 10-113.   Double Frontage Residential Lots
Double frontage lots should be avoided except where necessary to separate
residential development from limited-access highways, thoroughfares, or
arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation. Where they are platted they must meet the following requirements:
   a.   Restricted Access
      1.   Driveway access to a double frontage lot must be provided from the
street with the lowest classification.
      2.   The city may require that a notation be placed on the plat to limit
the facing of main structures to the street with the higher classification. 
      3.   A minimum six feet high uniform wood fence or masonry wall is
constructed the full length of the rear yards abutting the second roadway. Add
masonry columns and minimum three brick course when abutting arterial.
      4.   Where a double frontage lot has been created that abuts more than
one public right-of-way, and at least one of these rights-of-way is a freeway,
limited-access highway, thoroughfare or arterial street, the subdivider may be
required by the city to relinquish all rights of access to, and from, such lots
across the lot lines abutting such freeway, limited-access highway,
thoroughfare or arterial.
      5.   Trees are encouraged to be planted between the fence and the
abutting street.
   b.   Lot Dimensions
      Double frontage lots must be at least [100 feet in depth] so as to
provide adequate rear yard area for screening and buffering of the rear of the
structure, as required by this section.
Sec. 10-114.   Blocks
   a.   The city encourages developers to limit block length to 600 feet, but
the length may be varied according to circulation, topography, and provisions
of the master street plan. In no case should a block length exceed 1,200 feet
in length without approval of the Planning Commission.
   b.   Where block lengths exceed 600 feet, the developer is encouraged to
provide a pedestrian access easement at or near the mid-point of the block.
   c.   Blocks must have a minimum width of 200 feet and be able to provide for
two tiers of lots of appropriate depths.
   d.   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks must be appropriate for the
locality and the type of development contemplated.
Sec. 10-115.   Lots and Blocks in Nonresidential Plats
   a.   General Requirements
      A non-residential plat will be subject to all the requirements of these
regulations, except those that clearly pertain only to residential properties,
as well as such additional standards as may be required by the planning and
zoning commission, and must conform to the proposed land use and standards
established in the Tyler 1st Comprehensive Plan and this development code. 
Site plan approval and plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the
discretion of the commission. (Ord. No. 0-2014-33; 4/23/14)
   b.   Design Principles
      In addition to the regulations in this section, which are appropriate to
all platting, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
planning and zoning commission that the street, parcel, and block pattern
proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account
other uses in the vicinity.  The following principles must be observed:
      1.   Proposed non-residential parcels must be suitable in area and
dimensions to the types of non-residential development anticipated.
      2.   Street rights-of-way and pavement must be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
      3.   Residential areas must be protected from potential nuisance from a
proposed non-residential plat.
      4.   Streets carrying non-residential traffic, especially truck traffic,
may not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or future
residential areas, except where required by the master street plan.
   c.   Frontage Standards
      All non-residential lots established after April 24, 2008 must conform to
the requirements of the specific zoning district as set forth in
Article II.
Sec. 10-116   Soil Preservation, Grading, and Debris
   a.   Soil preservation and final grading must conform to the regulations set
forth in
Article VII, Division E.
   b.   Debris and Waste
      No cut trees, timber, debris, large rocks or stones, junk, rubbish or
other waste materials of any kind must be buried in any land, or left or
deposited on any lot or street at the time of final acceptance by the
development services engineer and removal of those items and materials will be
required prior to such acceptance.  No items and materials as herein described
may be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision or addition at the time
of expiration of any improvement agreement or acceptance of dedication of
public improvements, whichever is sooner.  However, dirt or topsoil stockpiled
for more than six months on a property requires approval of the development
services engineer.
Sec. 10-117 - 119.   Reserved
DIVISION C.
Gated Development Standards
Sec. 10-120.   Purpose
The purpose of this division is to ensure that features installed to restrict
access to gated developments do not pose a threat to the health, safety, and

Subdivision Improvement Agreement
Sec. 10-130.   Completion of Improvements
Except as provided below, before the issuance of any building permit all
applicants are required to complete, in accordance with the city's decision and
to the satisfaction of the development services engineer, all the street,
sanitary, and other public improvements, as well as lot improvements on the
individual residential lots of the subdivision or addition as required in these
regulations, specified in the final plat, and as approved by the planning and
zoning commission, and to dedicate those public improvements to the city. As
used in this section, "lot improvements" refers to grading and installation of
improvements required for proper drainage and prevention of soil erosion.
Sec. 10-131.   Improvement Agreement and Guarantee
   a.   Agreement
      The development services engineer may waive the requirement that the
applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements and may permit the
developer to enter into an improvement agreement by which developer covenants
to complete all required public improvements no later than two years following
the date on which the final plat is signed.  The planning and zoning commission
may also require the developer to complete and dedicate some required public
improvements prior to final acceptance and to enter into an improvement
agreement for completion of the remainder of the required improvements during
such two-year period.  The improvement agreement may contain such other terms
and conditions as are agreed to by the developer and the city. 
   b.   Agreement Required for Oversize Reimbursement
      The city will require an improvement agreement pertaining to any public
improvement for which the developer may request reimbursement from the city for
oversize costs as provided in
Chapter 19 of the City Code for water and sewer improvements and
Article IV, Division D of this code for all other improvements. The city
council may authorize the approval of such agreement as meeting the city
requirements, and the city will not withhold approval as a means of avoiding
compensation due under the terms of this code. 
   c.   Security
      Whenever the city permits a developer to enter into an improvement
agreement, it may require the developer to provide sufficient security,
covering the completion of the public improvements.  The security must be in
the form of cash escrow or, where authorized by the City, a letter of credit or
other security acceptable to the city attorney, as security for the promises
contained in the improvement agreement.  In addition to all other security, for
completion of those public improvements where the city participates in the
cost, the contractor must provide a performance bond, with the city as a co-
obligee.  Security must be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the estimated
cost of completion of the required public improvements and lot improvements. 
The issuer of any surety bond and letter of credit will be subject to approval
of the city attorney.
   d.   Letter of Credit
      If the planning and zoning commission authorizes the developer to post a
letter of credit as security for its promises contained in the improvement
agreement, the letter of credit must:
      1.   Be irrevocable.
      2.   Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance, and
warranty periods but in no event less than two years.
      3.   Require only that the city present the issuer with a sight draft and
a certificate signed by an authorized representative of the city certifying to
the city's right to draw funds under the letter of credit.
   e.   Reduction to Letter of Credit
      As portions of the public improvements are completed in accordance with
the standard specifications and the engineering plans, the developer may make
application to the development services engineer or designee to reduce the
amount of the original letter of credit.  If the development services engineer
or designee is satisfied that such portion of the improvements has been
completed in accordance with city standards, development services engineer may
cause reduce that the remaining amount of the letter of credit to an amount
that adequately insures the completion of the remaining public improvements.
   f.   Reduction in Required Security
      Upon the dedication of and acceptance by the city of all required public
improvements, the city may authorize a reduction in the security to 10 percent
of the original amount of the security if the developer is not in breach of the
improvement agreement.  The remaining security must be for the developer’s
covenant to maintain the required public improvements and the warrant that the
improvements are free from defect for one year thereafter.  If the required
security for maintenance and warranty is provided by the contractors or by
others, the city will release the entire amount of the developer security.
Sec. 10-132.   Temporary Improvements
The developer must build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements
required by the development services engineer and must maintain those temporary
improvements for the period specified by the planning and zoning commission. 
Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the developer
must file with the city a separate improvement agreement and escrow or, where
authorized, a letter of credit, in an appropriate amount for temporary
facilities, which agreement and escrow or letter of credit must ensure that the
temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed.
Sec. 10-133.   Failure to Complete Improvements
No building permits will be issued for plats for which no improvement agreement
has been executed and no security has been posted.  In those cases where an
improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted and
required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of the
agreement, the city may:
   a.   Declare the agreement to be in default and require that all the public
improvements be installed regardless of the extent of completion of the
development at the time the agreement is declared to be in default;
   b.   Obtain funds under the security and complete the public improvements
itself or through a third party;
   c.   Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third
party, including a subsequent developer of the subdivision or addition for
which public improvements were not constructed, in whole or in part, in
exchange for that subsequent  developer’s promise to complete the public
improvements on the tract; or
   d.   Exercise any other rights available under the law.
Sec. 10-134.   Maintenance and Guarantee of Public Improvements
   The developer must maintain all required street, utility, and drainage
improvements for a period of one year following the acceptance by the city. The
developer must also provide a warranty, in the form of a maintenance bond in
the amount of 100 percent of the construction cost guaranteeing that all public
improvements will be free from defect for a period of one year following such
acceptance by the city. (Ord. No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-2000) (Ord. No. 0-2006-19, 2/

schedule:
   a.   Water and Sewer Utilities
      Funding of water and sewer utility improvements must be in accordance
with City Code
Chapter 19.
   b.   Drainage
      The developer must bear the full cost of all drainage structures
including inlets, culverts, storm sewers, manholes, and subdrains required to
carry storm drainage or groundwater on or across the property of its origin.
The City may, at its option, participate in the cost of drainage improvements.
Participation must be approved individually on the merits of the work and the
availability of funds by City Council. Section 10-569 of this chapter governs
the City's participation in controlling flooding and erosion with creeks and
drainage courses.
   c.   Paving
      The cost of clearing, excavation to a depth of one foot, subgrade
stabilization, installing curb and gutter, and paving will be the sole
responsibility of developer for standard width streets as set forth in Sec. 10-
155. If funds are available, the City will pay for a proportionate share of the
clearing, paving, curb and gutter medians, subgrade stabilization, excavation
to a depth of one foot, and drainage structures in excess of 32 feet between
the face of curbs in single family residential zoned property, and in excess of
40 feet between the face of curbs in property zoned other than single family
residential, if such extra width is required by the City, and upon approval by
City Council prior to beginning any construction on said street(s).

   Where the proposed subdivision is adjacent to both sides of an existing
substandard street or road, said street or road being substandard according to
City of Tyler's Standard Specifications, the developer will be required to
improve the existing street or road to bring same to City standards, or to
replace it with a standard City street or road, at no cost to the City, other
than as set out in the cost-sharing policy of the City in effect at the time of
approval of the final plat. Where the proposed subdivision is adjacent to only
one side of a substandard street or road, and/or where, in the City's judgment,
it is not feasible to reconstruct said substandard street or road at the time
of development of said subdivision, the City may permit the developer to
provide the City an escrow payment for an amount of money equal to the
developer's share of the cost of said improvements which will be calculated by
the developer's engineer and approved by a professional engineer retained by
the City of Tyler, as a condition precedent to approval of said final plat of
said subdivision and as a condition precedent to acceptance of the public
street or road.  (Ord. No. 0-2013-77; 8/28/13) (Ord. No. O-2018-17; 2/14/18)
Sec. 10-142.   Escrow Policies and Procedures
   a.   Eligibility
      As outlined in Sec. 10-103, developers are required to bear the entire
cost to design, construct, and install the minimum infrastructure required to
service their development. The City may grant the developer relief from
constructing the additional improvements only under the following
circumstances:
      1.   Where required street improvements are associated with a project
that is listed on the current City of Tyler Half Cent Sales Tax Fund 231 Ten
Year Forecast through submission of an escrow deposit.
      2.   When the City agrees that compliance with the minimum infrastructure
required will require that the applicant construct both his/her portion of the
street and the other half of the street, the applicant may voluntarily enter
into an agreement with the City to accept an escrow deposit for a period not to
exceed 20 years, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreement.
   b.   Deposit with City
      Whenever the City agrees to accept escrow deposits in lieu of
construction by the developer of the property under these regulations, the
developer must deposit an amount equal to his/her share of the costs of design
and construction in escrow with the City plus an additional 20 percent at time
of original deposit. Such amount must be paid prior to release of construction
plans by Engineering. In lieu of such payment at such time, the City may permit
the developer to contract with the City and must agree in such contract that no
building permit will be issued for any lot included within said plat, or
increment thereof, until the full amount of the escrow is paid, or a pro rata
part thereof for the full increment if developed incrementally. The obligations
and responsibilities of the developer will become those of developer's
transferees, successors and assigns; and the liability, therefore, will be
joint and several.
   c.   Determination of Escrow Amount
      The developer will be required to retain the services of an engineer to
calculate the escrow amount based on the required public improvements as
referenced in
Sec 10-103a. The City may, at its sole discretion, on a case by case basis
calculate the required escrow.  The amount of the escrow will be determined
using best practices for design and construction costs at the time the escrow
is due here under.
   d.   Refunds
      Escrows which have been placed with the City under this section which
have been held for a period of 10 years, unless otherwise authorized under
Subsection a(2) of this Section, from the date of such payment, in the event
that the city has not authorized the preparation of plans and specifications
for construction of such roadway facilities for which the escrow was made,
must, upon written request, be returned to the developer, with accrued
interest.

      If any street or highway for which escrow is deposited for is
constructed, or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no cost
to the City, the escrowed funds and accrued interest will be refunded to the
developer after completion and acceptance of the public improvements. In the
event that a portion of the cost is borne by the City and the other portion of
the cost by another governmental authority, the difference between the
developer's actual proportionate cost and the escrowed funds, including accrued
interest, if any, will be refunded after completion and acceptance of the
improvements.
   e.   Interest Limitation
      If money is refunded within six months of deposit, only the principal
will be refunded.  Monies returned after this date will be refunded with
interest accrued, calculated at one percent less than the rate of actual
earnings.
   f.   Payment of Fees, Charges, and Assessments
      As a condition of plat approval, the developer must pay all fees, charges
and assessments required to assure adequacy of public facilities to the
subdivision or addition, as may be imposed under these or other regulations of
the City. (Ord. No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-2000) (Ord. No. 0-2006-19, 2/8/06) (Ord. No.

Master Street Plan
Sec. 10-150.   Purpose 
A Master Street Plan has been approved by the City Council on September 12,
2012, to establish arterial streets and to serve as a guide for future
collector street development in Tyler. The purpose of this plan is to provide
for orderly improvement and expansion of the roadway system at minimum cost as
the need for improvements arises.  The plan delineates the street network
estimated to be needed in the future for the Tyler urban area and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction.  A copy of the master street plan is on file and
available for public review in the planning department and city clerk's office.

Sec. 10-152.   Unplatted Property
All unplatted property is required to meet all requirements of the master
street plan, including the dedication requirements in this division.
Sec. 10-153.   Waivers to Right-of-Way Dedication Requirements
   a.   Exemptions.
   An exemption to the master street plan right-of-way dedication requirements
in
Article V, Division A, will be allowed when the property is re-platted, if the
following requirements are met:
      1.   There is an existing plat of record for the property to be
replatted; and any newly created lots have an existing building that is
designed and built for the support, enclosure, shelter, protection or use for
permanent or continuous occupancy by persons for assembly, business, education,
industrial, institutional, mercantile, or residential purposes, and where
minimum right-of-way was previously dedicated  or;
      2.   The road is built to its ultimate cross section, including curb,
gutter, and sidewalks.
   b.   Voluntary Joint Applications for Amendments 
      Any person that desires to develop a street in a manner inconsistent with
the requirements of the master street plan, maps or report described above, may
seek to file a written request jointly signed by the person, the city, and all
parties to be immediately affected by the requested change, with the planning
department. The filing fee for such voluntary joint amendment application will
be in an amount established by the city council and kept on file by the
planning department. If all parties agree, then the proposed amendment
application will then be placed on a planning and zoning commission agenda. The
planning and zoning commission will conduct a public hearing and will then make
a recommendation to the city council.  The city council will make a final
determination concerning the requested change and will decide if the master
street plan, report, or maps will be followed or amended.  (Ord. No. 0-2006-11,
1/11/06)
   c.   Appeals
      Any person that desires to develop a street in a manner inconsistent with
the requirements in the master street plan, maps, or report described above
must file a written request along with the reasons therefore with the planning
department. The filing fee for such written request will be in an amount
established by the city council and kept on file by the planning department.
The appeal or requested change will then be placed on a planning and zoning
commission agenda. The planning and zoning commission must conduct a public
hearing and will then make a recommendation to the city council.  The city

Note 1:   Street extensions or stub-outs into unplanned areas must have a
minimum pavement width of 32 feet measured face of curb to face of curb.
Note 2:   The width of a major collector must be flared to 52 feet at the
intersection with an arterial or major collector. The width of the right-of-way
must be flared to 80 feet.  The length of the flare must be 130 feet with a 100
foot taper.
Note 3:   Commercial use shall be based on the following Zoning Districts:  R-
MF, C-1, C-2, DBAC, M-1 and M-2.  If a street fronts along a commercially zoned
district on one side of the street and on a residentially zoned district on the
other, then both sides must plat the street as a C or D street, as applicable. 
If a street fronts along lots that are a mixture of both commercial and
residential zoning, then both sides must plat the street as a C or D street, as
applicable. (Ord. No 0-2010-119, 11/10/10)
Note 4: In addition to the classifications listed above, the master street plan
classifies road construction standards into the following subgroups: rural,
suburban, urban, and urban core. Typical cross sections for each road type can
be found in the master street plan. (Ord. 0-2013-16, 2/27/13)
(Ord. No. 0-2017-69; 8/23/17)
Sec. 10-156.   Improvement, Widening, and Realignment of Streets
Where a subdivision or addition borders a substandard street or when the master
street plan indicates plans for realignment, widening or constructing a street
that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision or addition, the
applicant will be required to improve and dedicate those areas for widening or
realignment of those streets, as follows:
   a.   When a proposed subdivision or addition abuts or will abut both sides
of a substandard street or a proposed street in the master street plan, the
developer will be required to improve the substandard street or proposed street
so that it will be a standard street, including sidewalks.  The minimum street
paving widths are set forth inSec.
10-155 Minimum Paving Widths Table.
   b.   If the proposed subdivision or addition is located along only one side
of a substandard street or a proposed street in the master street plan, the
developer will be required to improve developer’s side of the substandard
street or proposed street, including sidewalks, so that it will be a standard
street.  The minimum street paving width will be as shown in chart of street
widths set forth in this section.  The developer may, however, petition the
city to construct the improvements herein required, subject, upon approval, to
the city's escrow policies stated in Sec.
10-142.
   c.   When an arterial street is to be extended through a property to
intersect with another arterial street, all lanes must be constructed for a
minimum distance of 350 feet from the point of intersection.  From that point
the pavement width may be decreased by two lanes, with provision of an
appropriate transition in paving width.  If property abutting only one side of
the proposed thoroughfare is to be developed, then half the roadway will be
constructed, including left turn lane and transition.  This provision will not
require widening an existing intersection that already provides four through
lanes. (Ord. No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-2000)
   d.   Exemption to public improvement requirements for certain plats.  An
exemption to the requirements for improvement, widening and realignment of
existing and proposed streets set forth in subsections (a) through (c) above
will be allowed when the property is finally platted, if any newly created lots
have an existing building that is designed and built for the support,
enclosure, shelter, protection or use for permanent or continuous occupancy by
persons for assembly, business, education, industrial, institutional,
mercantile, or residential purposes.
   e.   Exemption to public improvement requirements for certain replats.  An
exemption to the requirements for improvement, widening and realignment of
existing and proposed streets set forth in subsections (a) through (c) above
will be allowed when the property is replatted, if all of the following
requirements are met:
      1.   There is an existing plat of record for the property to be
replatted; and
      2.   Any newly created lots have an existing building that is designed
and built for the support, enclosure, shelter, protection or use for permanent
or continuous occupancy by persons for assembly, business, education,
industrial, institutional, mercantile, or residential purposes. (Ord. No. 0-
2000-11, 3-1-2000) (Ord. No. 0-2006-19; 2/8/06)

way approved by the development services engineer.  Alleys for other than
single-family residential uses must be dedicated and paved a minimum of 20 feet
wide within a minimum 20-foot right-of-way. The owner must construct the full
width of the alley at owner’s expense.
Sec. 10-162.   Curb and Gutter
Curbs and gutters must conform to standard city design and construction and are
required in all subdivisions except roads designated as rural on the Master
Street Plan and residential subdivisions where all lots are larger than two
acres.  Alternate curb and gutter construction are allowed in planned districts
with the approval of the development services engineer. This exception will
only apply to local streets and not on extensions of collector or arterial
streets or streets proposed as such in the master street plan.    (Ord. No. 0-
2013-16; 2/27/13)
Sec. 10-163.   Future Connections

open spaces or undevelopable land as shown on the preliminary plat and phasing
plan must be platted at the time the adjacent developable lots are platted.
(Ord. No. 0-2017-100; 11/8/17)
Sec. 10-166.   Topography and Arrangement
   a.   All streets must be properly integrated with the existing and proposed
system of streets and dedicated rights-of-way as established on the master
street plan. 
   b.   Proposed streets must extend to the boundary lines of the tract to be
platted, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless
in the opinion of the commission such extension is not necessary or desirable
for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision or addition with the
existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
Sec. 10-167.   Cul-de-Sacs
   a.   No cul-de-sac unless otherwise authorized by the planning and zoning
commission may exceed 600 feet in length, as measured from the centerline of
the street with which it intersects to the center point of the cul-de-sac. Cul-
de-sac lengths longer than those specified in this section will require
approval of a variance.  In reviewing a variance, the commission will consider
the following:
      1.   Alternative designs which would reduce street, cul-de-sacs, or alley
length;
      2.   The effect of overlong blocks, cul-de-sacs, or alleys on access,
congestion, and delivery of municipal services; and
      3.   Means of mitigation, including but not limited to increased street
width, mid-block turnarounds, limitation on the number of lots to be created
and served, temporary points of access, and additional fire protection
measures.
Sec. 10-168.   Dead End Streets
   a.   For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, permanent dead-end streets will, in general, be prohibited. 
However, the planning and zoning commission may require the reservation or
dedication of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities,
pedestrian traffic, or utilities. 
   b.   A cul-de-sac turnaround must be provided at the end of a permanent
dead-end street in accordance with Design Guidelines for Subdivision
Improvements.
   c.   The city may require the construction of temporary dead-end streets in
order to provide for the future connection of subdivisions and to ensure
reasonable access and avoid excessive street length.
Sec. 10-169.   Street Names and Signs
   a.   Street names must be submitted to the planning department for
approval.  Street names and subdivision names will be referred to the 9-1-
1 Network of East Texas for verification.  Streets that are to be in alignment
with existing streets must be given the same name.  Names must be sufficiently
different in sound and spelling so as not to cause conflict or confusion.  The
planning department will maintain an index of street names.  Street names and
subdivision names are fixed at the time of approval of the final plat.
   b.   The developer must provide payment for street name signs for the
development.  The price of each street name installation will include the cost
of the sign assembly, pole, and installation.  Payment by the developer will be
due prior to approval of the engineering plans by the development services
engineer.
   c.   Street name signs will be installed by the city upon acceptance of the
development street improvements by the development services engineer.

Street Connectivity
Sec. 10-180.   Purpose
An interconnected street system is necessary in order to promote the public
health, safety, and welfare of the city, as well as orderly and healthful
development by ensuring that streets function in an interdependent manner,
provide adequate access for emergency and service vehicles, enhance walkability
by ensuring connected transportation routes, and provide continuous and
comprehensible traffic routes.
Sec. 10-181.   Applicability
All proposed streets must be continuous and connect to existing, platted, or
planned streets without offset, except for cul-de-sacs as permitted in Sec.
10-167.
Sec. 10-182.   Reserved
Sec. 10-183.   Reserved
Sec. 10-184.   Collector Street Connectivity Requirement
All collector-designated streets will connect on both ends to an existing or
planned collector or higher-level street.
Sec. 10-185.   Street Layout
Adequate streets must be provided by the subdivider such that the arrangement,
character, extent, width and grade of each must conform to the master street
plan and will be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
to the topographical conditions, to the public safety and convenience and to
their appropriate relationship to the proposed use of the land to be served by
such streets.
Sec. 10-186.   Circulation
   a.   Each subdivision must provide for the continuation of all arterial
streets and highways as shown on the master street plan.  Arterial streets
should be located on the perimeter of the residential neighborhood.
   b.   Collector and local streets should be designed to provide access to
each parcel of land within the residential neighborhood and within industrial
areas.  They should be planned so that future urban expansion will not require
the conversion of minor streets to arterial routes.
   c.   Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from
other minor streets to the major street and expressway system and to provide
access to public facilities within the neighborhood; however, collector streets
should not be aligned in a manner that will encourage their use by through
traffic.
   d.   Permitted alternative to cul-de-sacs include loop lanes and T-streets,
and any similar alternative approved by the development services engineer.

Sec. 10-187.   Required Subdivision Access Points
   a.   A subdivision of  < 60 lots or less must provide access to the existing
or planned public roadway system via at least one access points.
   b.   A subdivision of 61 lots to < 120 lots must provide access to the
existing or proposed public roadway system via two access points at minimum
unless extreme natural conditions, as determined by the planning director and
the development services engineer, make such connection infeasible. A divided
boulevard entrance with two lanes in and two lanes out may count as two access
points.
   c.   Subdivisions of >121 lots or greater will be required to provide at
least three access points to the existing or proposed public roadway system,
subject to review by the development services engineer. The additional access
points must be shown on the plat and construction plans for the development;
however, construction of the street may be postponed to a later phase of
development. The planning and zoning commission may require the construction of
any access point at the time of approval of the final plat unless extreme
natural conditions, as determined by the planning director and the development
services engineer, make such connection infeasible.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-19; 3/11/
09)
Sec. 10-188.   Relation to Adjoining Street Systems
To provide connectivity to other neighborhoods existing streets in adjacent or
adjoining areas must be continued in the new development, in alignment
therewith.  Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets
are required by this section, the right-of-way must be extended and the street
developed to the property line of the subdivided property (or to the edge of
the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract) at the point where the
connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. The development
services engineer will require temporary turn-arounds to be constructed at the
end of such streets pending their extension when such turn-arounds appear
necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate emergency or service
vehicles. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, no temporary
dead-end street in excess of 600 feet may be created unless no other practical
alternative is available.
Sec. 10-189.   Street Jogs
Where off-sets in street alignment are, in the opinion of the development
services engineer, unavoidable due to natural features or other unique elements
of the land, such off-sets may be included, provided the distance between
center lines is not less than 200 feet.
Sec. 10-190.   Large Lot Subdivision
If the lots in the proposed subdivision are large enough to suggest re-
subdivision in the future, or if part of the parent tract is not platted,
consideration must be given to possible future street openings and access to
future lots which could result from such re-subdivision.
Sec. 10-191.   Through Traffic
   a.   Local streets must be designed so as to meet the local street
connectivity requirements of
Article V, Division C.
   b.   The arrangement of streets must provide for the continuation of streets
between adjacent properties.
   c.   If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must temporarily
be a dead-end street the right-of-way must be extended to the property line.
   d.   Where existing alleys are used, alley turnouts must be provided to new
subdivisions.
Sec. 10-192 - 199.   Reserved

to the city prior to final approval. (Ord. No. 0-2014-97; 10/22/14)
Sec. 10-206.   Plans and Inspections
   a.   Developments proposed with private streets must submit to the city the
same plans and engineering information required to construct public streets and
utilities.
   b.   Requirements pertaining to inspection and approval of improvements for
private streets must be the same as for public streets. Fees charged for these
services will also apply.

periodically thereafter to ensure the streets are in good condition and that
emergency access is maintained.
Sec. 10-207.   Access Restrictions
The entrances to all private streets and ways must be marked with a sign
stating that it is a private street or way.  Guard houses, access control
gates, and cross arms may be constructed.  All restricted access entrances must
be in compliance with
Article IV, Division C. If the association fails to maintain reliable access as
required to provide city services, the city may enter the subdivision and
remove any gate or device which is a barrier to access at the sole expense of
the association.  (Ord. No. 0-2014-97; 10/22/14)
Sec. 10-208.   Petition to Convert to Public Streets
A property owner's association may request that the City accept private streets
and alleys and the associated property as public streets and right-of-way.
However, in no event will the City be obligated to accept said streets and
alleys as public. Should the City elect to accept the streets and alleys as
public, it may inspect the private streets and assess the lot owners for the
initial expense of needed repairs to bring the streets or alleys up to City
standards and concurrent with the City's acceptance of the streets and alleys.
The City will be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed. The City may
also require, at the association's expense and concurrent with the City's
acceptance of the streets and alleys, the removal of guard houses, access
control devices, landscaping or other aesthetic amenities located within the
street lot, as a condition of acceptance.

Private ways, as they are not constructed to public street standards, are not
eligible for petition to convert to public maintenance. (Ord. No. 0-2014-97;
10/22/14) (Ord. No. 0-2016-8; 1/27/16)

   a.   For public or private street construction occurring within a
subdivision in Zone 2 of the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the developer must
provide to the city a construction bond or letter of credit made payable to
Smith County with a copy provided to the City in an amount established by the
city council and kept on file in the development services department, which
will be in effect until street construction is completed.  (Ord. No. 0-2003-50,
9/24/03)
   b.   For public street construction occurring within a subdivision in Zone 2
of the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the developer must provide to the city a
one-year maintenance bond or letter of credit made payable to Smith County with
a copy provided to the City in an amount established by the city council and
kept on file in the development services department, which will be in effect
after the acceptance of construction.  (Ord. No. 0-2003-50, 9/24/03) (Ord. No.
0-2003-72, 12/10/03)
Sec. 10-211.   Private Driveways
   a.   Required Permits and Plans for Private Driveways
      1.   Driveways and sidewalks shall be located and constructed according
to the city Driveway Design Standards and Paving Detail Standards on file with
the development services engineer.
      2.   No driveway may be constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired,
until a permit is issued by the development services department.  Unless
otherwise expressly stated herein, the provisions of this chapter will apply to
state highways.  It is the responsibility of development services engineer to
provide the Texas Department of Transportation with a copy of driveway permits
issued on state highways no later than 10 business days following issuance of
same. 
      3.   No driveway permit for a major driveway may be issued by the
development services department for commercial driveways until the traffic
engineer has approved the driveway location and design of the off street
parking plan.
      4.   Each application for a major driveway permit must include a driveway
design and an off-street parking plan.  The plan must be drawn to scale,
showing all parking spaces, all existing and proposed curb inlets, landscaping,
fences, barriers, utilities, driveway dimensions, all existing driveways on the
property, all existing driveways on adjacent properties located within  100
feet of the proposed driveway, the street address, and any additional
information required by the development services engineer.
      5.   If the proposed driveway plan is part of a new building construction
or remodeling plan requiring a building permit, the driveway permit may not be
issued until the building permit has been issued. (Ord. of 8-19-75, § 2(A)(1),
(2), (3)) (0-98-31, 4-15-98) (Ord. No. O-2000-76, 10-4-2000) (Ord. No. 0-2006-

   b.   Revocation or Denial of Permit
      Any permit granted by the development services department pursuant to
this chapter may be revoked by the development services engineer any time the
terms of this chapter are violated, or when the continued exercise of the
privilege constitutes a menace to the public safety or is an unreasonable use
of the public streets or ways. Repeated and suspected intentional violations
will be deemed sufficient reason to deny issuance of permits in future
applications by the individual violators.
   c.   Removal of Unauthorized Driveway
      If a driveway is constructed, altered, or modified without the issuance
of a driveway permit, in violation of the conditions of the permit, or in
violation of this division, the development services engineer may require the
violator, at violator’s expense, to remove the driveway and restore the street
and right-of-way to its original condition. 
   d.   Driveway Profiles
      Driveway profiles must be determined based upon the grade of a two-way,
one-way or divided commercial driveway and shall not exceed 10 percent across
public right-of-way. All driveways shall be designed to allow accessible
traversing by pedestrian sidewalks, where accessible means complying with the
Texas Accessibility Standards and the American Disabilities Act. 
   e.   Driveway Spacing
      Driveway spacing must adhere to Table
10-211e:  Spacing is to be measured from the end of radius of the driveway to

egress to an arterial or collector street as identified in the Master Street
Plan.
      1.   Except in DBAC, PMXD-1, and PMXD-2, off-street parking spaces must
be arranged so that no vehicle will back directly onto a street or primary
access aisle in a shopping center.  All private parking areas and circulation
driveways must be located off of the street right-of-way.  Divisional islands
and curbs must be constructed where necessary to provide such protection. (Ord.
No. 0-2014-97; 10/22/14)
      2.   Driveways must be designed so that vehicles entering the driveway
from the street will not encroach upon the exit lane of a two-way driveway. 
Also, a right-turning exiting vehicle must be able to use only the first
through traffic lane available without encroaching into the adjacent through
lane.
      3.   Direct-access driveway placement must provide exiting vehicles an
unobstructed sight distance onto the roadway according to the following
schedule.

Sec. 10-232.   Changing Sidewalk Width or Grade
It is unlawful to construct, pave or repair any sidewalk to increase or
diminish the width thereof as established by ordinance or elevate or lower the
same above or below the grade established therefore by the city, or in case the
city has established no grade to elevate or lower the same above or below the
sidewalks of adjoining property.  (Rev. Ords. 1903, Art. 369)  (Ord. No. 0-
2000-69, 9/20/00) 
Sec. 10-233.   Maintenance of Sidewalks and Pedestrian Areas
   a.   Repair of Defective Sidewalks
      A sidewalk or appurtenance thereto that becomes defective, unsafe or
hazardous is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and is unlawful.  It will
be the duty of the owner of the abutting property to reconstruct or repair the
sidewalk at such owner’s expense. This duty exists independently of any action
by city to notify the abutting owners of the conditions. If a sidewalk or
appurtenance thereto is found by the city to be defective, unsafe, or
hazardous, the development services engineer will notify the owner of the
abutting property to reconstruct or repair same. Failure to reconstruct or
repair such defective, unsafe, or hazardous conditions within 30 days from the
date of written notice to do so, or failure to begin such reconstruction or
repair within 15 days from the date of such notice, is unlawful.
   b.   Liability for Defective Sidewalks
      The abutting property owner or person enjoying the use of any property
abutting on a sidewalk that has become defective and has resulted in damage or
injury will be primarily liable in damages for any loss or damage sustained as
a result of such defective condition. The city will not be held as assuming any
such liability by reason of inspection or reinspection or notice to abutting
property owner as authorized herein or by reason of the approval or disapproval
of any access, facilities, surfacing or appurtenances not made in accordance
with the City Sidewalk Design Standards and Specifications (available in the
development services department.)
   c.   Liability for Special Use of Sidewalks
      It is the duty of any property owner, landlord, tenant, lessee,
sublessee, person, firm or corporation making special use of any sidewalk for
the purpose of ingress or egress, for loading elevators, downspout drains or
any other special use, whether recited herein or not, to keep such sidewalk
abutting such property in a good and safe condition and free from any defects
or hazards. Any defective condition of the sidewalk, loading elevator,
downspout drain or any other special use or facility is hereby declared to be a
public nuisance and is unlawful, and the special user will be liable in damages
for any loss or damages sustained as a result of such defective condition.
   d.   Liens and Liabilities on Abutting Owners
      1.   If any person fails or refuses to comply with this section, the city
may but assumes no duty to, go upon such property and do the work necessary to
obtain compliance with this section. The expense so incurred by city in
correcting the condition may be assessed against, and will be a personal
obligation of, the owner of the abutting property. If the owner fails or
refuses to pay such expense within 30 days after the work was done, and after
the notice and hearing requirements of City Charter Section 51 have been met,
the city may file with the Smith County Clerk a statement of expenses incurred
in correcting the condition of the property. When such statement is filed, the
city will have a privileged lien on such property to secure the payment of the
expended amount. Such amount will bear interest at the rate of eight percent
per annum from the date the city incurs the expense. For any such expenditure
and interest and reasonable attorneys fees, suit may be instituted and recovery
and foreclosure had by city.
      2.   Nothing herein will inhibit the right of city to make immediate
repair of any condition considered to be of unusual and immediate danger to
life or limb. In such instance the development services engineer will send an
invoice for expenses incurred in the repair of such condition to the owner of
the abutting property. If the owner fails or refuses to pay such expense within
30 days after notice of the reasonable charge by the development services
engineer, the city may follow the above procedure to perfect a lien on such
property.
   e.   Compliance
      Before any repair or maintenance work is commenced pursuant to this
section, the abutting property owner or person enjoying the use of any property
abutting a sidewalk must comply with all permit, licensing and bond
requirements as set forth in this chapter. (O-93-107, Pt. 1, 12-14-93) (Ord.
No. 0-2000-69, 9-20-2000)

street, alley, sidewalk, gutter, storm drain, creek or drainageway in such
condition as to impair the drainage of same.  (Rev. Ords. 1903, Art. 410; Ord.

excavation will restore the surface to at least the preexisting condition, to
the satisfaction of the development services engineer. (Rev. Ords. 1903, Art.

No. 0-2000-69, 9-20-2000)
Sec. 10-239.   Gutters

Sec. 10-240.   Compliance with Standard Sidewalk Specifications
It is unlawful to construct or cause to be constructed any sidewalks, curbs,
gutters, driveways, or alley pavements in any street or public place otherwise
than in full and strict conformity with the city’s Sidewalk Design Standards
and Specifications available in the development services department. (Ord. of

gutters, driveways or alley pavement must first apply for and obtain a license,
give a bond, and obtain a permit specially authorizing such work. The
contractor must also obtain the engineering drawings depicting the lines,
grades, and specifications as provided for in this section. Such license, bond,
and permit must be in full force and effect at the time the excavation or

applicant, and must also state the names of each person owning or holding any
financial interest or share of stock in any firm or corporation applying for
such license.  For each person so required to be mentioned, said application
must also state the experience of such person in such construction work, and
must also state whether or not the applicant has duly conformed to all city
requirements as to all such work theretofore done in the city, and if not, why
not. (Ord. of 6-7-35, § 2(b)) (Ord. No. 0-96-61, 7/17/96) (0-98-31, 4/15/98)
(Ord. No. 0-2000-69, 9-20-2000)

sufficient to suspend the license. Each licensee will comply with all city
ordinances regulating such work, which will be a part of each agreement for
such work which may be hereafter made or entered into by any such contractor
and any property owner. (Ord. of 6-7-35, § 2(b)) (Ord. of 9-3-82, §1) (0-98-31,
4/15/98) (Ord. No. 0-2000-69, 9-20-2000)
Sec. 10-242.   Appeal

in accordance with
Chapter 1, Article IV, of the Tyler City Code, otherwise the decision of the
development services engineer is final.  (Ord. of 6-7-35, § 2(b)) (Ord. of 9-3-
82, §1) (Ord. 0-96-61, 7/17/96) (0-98-31, 4/15/98) (Ord. No. 0-2000-69, 9-20-
2000)
Sec. 10-243.   Sidewalk Bond
The bond must be filed with the application and shall be executed by the
contractor and by a good bonding company authorized to do business in the
state.  The form and sufficiency of the bond shall be subject to development
services engineer’s approval, and must be in an amount established by the city
council and kept on file in the development services department.  Said bond
must be conditioned among other things, that the contractor must, at its own
cost and expense, furnish all proper materials, tools and appliances, and
perform, execute, construct and complete all work undertaken, and comply with
the specifications and requirements in city ordinances.  If the development
services engineer declares in writing that the contractor has failed or refused
to construct and complete any such work in conformity with said obligations,
either the city or any contracting property owner injured on such contract may
sue and recover damages on such bond. Each bond will continue in effect during
the maintenance period of two years as provided in this code, as to all work
constructed or commenced in good faith on the ground during the period of the
license in connection with which such bond may be given.  Provided, however, on
written notice to the development services engineer and the contractor, any
surety on such bond may withdraw from all liability thereon on account of any
and all further work undertaken by the contractor for which excavation or
construction was not in good faith actually begun on the ground before the
delivery of such notice, and after receipt of such notice the contractor may
not begin any new work unless the contractor provides and procures the approval
of a new bond in the same manner as required for the first bond.  For any work
commenced in violation of these provisions, the contractor must not be entitled
to collect any pay. In any question as to when any work was actually begun the
decision of the development services engineer shall be conclusive on the
contractor and the sureties on all such bonds. In case the development services
engineer shall be of opinion at any time and on any reasonable grounds that the
solvency of or financial responsibility on any bond of any contractor is or may
be insufficient or materially reduced by actual possible claims, the
development services engineer may make written demand on the contractor for any
additional bond, which shall be of corresponding amount, form and sufficiency.
The contractor must immediately furnish any such requested additional bond, and
the previous bond will not be held to cover any work not actually begun as
aforesaid, before the date of such new bond, but all work begun after such date
must be covered by such new bond. (Ord. of 6-7-35, § 2(c)) (Ord. of 9-3-82, §2)
(Ord. of 8/21/84, §1) (Ord. 0-96-61, 7/17/96) (0-98-31, 4/15/98) (Ord. No. 0-
2000-69, 9-20-2000)
Sec. 10-244.   Sidewalk Permits
Before any such work must be commenced or any materials therefore placed on the
ground by or for any contractor, the contractor must file with the development
services engineer a written application for a permit authorizing such work,
which application must be in such form as may be required by the development
services engineer, and thereupon the development services engineer will issue
to such contractor, a signed permit in writing which, among other things, shall
be dated, name the contractor and property owner, and describe the character
and location of the work, and authorize the same to be executed . All permits
must have printed in large letters thereon the words "GOOD ONLY IF THE WORK BE
COMMENCED WITHIN SEVEN WORKING DAYS AFTER DATE HEREOF, AND THEREAFTER
CONTINUOUSLY PROSECUTED. FURTHER TIME WILL BE ALLOWED ONLY IF AN EXTENSION OF
TIME BE ENDORSED HEREON BY THE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES ENGINEER." No work may be
done under any permit except as so stated, but if the same is allowed to
expire, the contractor must apply for and procure a new permit, before
proceeding with any such work. The development services engineer will keep, or
cause to be kept, a copy of each permit (Ord. of 6-7-35, § 2(j)) (Ord. 0-96-61,
7/17/96) (0-98-31, 4/15/98) (Ord. No. 0-2000-69, 9-20-2000).
Sec. 10-245.   Cancellation of Sidewalk Licenses and Permits
If any contractor fails or refuses to conform to city ordinances, fails or
refuses to obey development services engineer, or fails or refuses to comply
with any provision of any contract made by such contractor consistent with such
ordinances, or fails or refuses to provide any additional bond when so required
by this chapter, the development services engineer may, by written notice,
suspend the license of such contractor, cancel all unexecuted permits issued to
the contractor, stop all such work being done by contractor, and withhold from
contractor all further permits for such work until all incomplete or defective
work or other objection shall be remedied. Such suspension shall be set aside
by written notice from the development services engineer if contractor has
remedied the problems.  If such failure or refusal by the contractor is, in the
opinion of the development services engineer, willful or persistent, the
development services engineer may decline to set aside such suspension. (Ord.
of 6-7-35, § 2(3)) (Ord. 0-96-61, 7/17/96) (0-98-31, 4/15/98) (Ord. No. 0-2000-
69, 9-20-2000)
Sec. 10-246.   Barriers and Warning Devices
At all times and periods during which any work under this code is being
performed and until such work is completed and accepted, the contractor must
place and maintain all necessary and proper barriers and other safeguards,
including watchmen, if necessary, upon and around the work for the prevention
of accidents, and at night must place, maintain and keep suitable and
sufficient lights. 
Sec. 10-247.   Indemnification for Damages
The contractor must indemnify and save harmless the city from and against all
actions and claims and against all costs, damages and expenses to which the
city may be put by reason of any injury or alleged injury to any person or
property, resulting or alleged to result from any act, negligence, carelessness
or want of skill in connection with or in the conduct of any such work, or in
guarding same, or from any improper methods, tools, implements or materials
used in its prosecution, or by or on account of any alleged act or omission
whatever of the contractor or agents, employees or servants, or of any assignee
or subcontractor or agents, employees or servants. The contractor and
bondspersons must make payment of all sums so recovered against the city in any
suits on account of such alleged injuries, to which the city may be made a
party, together with all such costs, damages and expenses as may be suffered by
the city, all so as to save the city whole and harmless from all such actions
or claims. (Ord. of 6/7/35, §2(d)) (Ord. No. 0-96-71, 7/17/96) (0-98-31, 4/15/
98) (Ord. No. 0-2000-69, 9-20-2000)
Sec. 10-248.   Work Under City Control; Correcting Defects
All work in city streets and public places is hereby declared to be wholly
subject to exclusive city control. Whenever in the development services
engineer's opinion any such work has not been completed within a reasonable
time, or has been executed in a defective manner, whether because of bad
workmanship or materials, or because not true to the lines or grades or
specifications therefore given by the development services engineer, then upon
written notice from the development services engineer, the contractor must 
promptly remedy, complete or remove and reconstruct such incomplete or
defective work as the development services engineer may require. these
provisions also apply to all repair and maintenance work; and if the contractor
fails or refuses so to do within a reasonable time specified by the development
services engineer, then the city council may order such work to be completed or
corrected or removed and wholly or partially reconstructed by the city or at
its instance so as in the opinion of the development services engineer may be
necessary to make same as good as originally required. The contractor must, on
completion of such work and according to the certified bill of cost prepared by
the development services engineer, pay to the city the cost of such work. The
sureties on the contractor's bond will be liable for the cost of such work. 
However, if the city fails or refuses to cause such work to be corrected or
completed as aforesaid, then the property owner may proceed in like manner, but
without order of the city council, and contractor and sureties will be liable
for and pay to the property owner the cost of such work as shown by a like
certified bill. (Ord. of 6-7-35, § 2(f)) (Ord. 0-96-61, 7/17/96) (0-98-31, 4/
15/98) (Ord. No. 0-2000-69, 9-20-2000). 
Sec. 10-249.   Maintenance or Repair Work
The contractor shall construct all such work, and use such materials in the
construction thereof, so that the same shall be and remain for and during a
period of not less than two years from the date when the permit was issued by
the city for the construction of such work, in good, sound, smooth and
serviceable condition and free from all cracks, breaks, disintegration, undue
wear, scaling or departures from true line or grade or other defects which
might impair the permanence or usefulness of such work.  However, such cracks
as may appear in expansion joints, or cuts between blocks, shall not be deemed
to be defects unless in the development services engineer’s opinion such cracks
are excessive in opening or defection of surface; and in case any defects
develop during such period which in the development services engineer’s opinion
are due in any measure to defects of workmanship or material, the contractor
shall remedy, repair or reconstruct such work, or any part thereof, as may be
required by the development services engineer.  Such work shall be known as
maintenance or repair work and the sureties of contractor's bond will be fully
liable for any defaults of contractor under these provisions. (Ord. of 6-7-35,
§ 2(h)) (Ord. 0-96-61, 7/17/96) (0-98-31, 4/15/98) (Ord. No. 0-2000-69, 9-20-

maintained sidewalks are important to the public health, safety and welfare,
and that sidewalk improvements are necessary, are in the public interest, and
are important for the convenience of citizens and for the proper development of
the city.  The city council hereby declares that defective, unsafe, or
hazardous sidewalks constitute a public nuisance, and are unlawful.  The city’s
participation in constructing, repairing, and/or maintaining sidewalks is
hereby established in this code.
   b.   City sidewalk project initiations not involving assessments against
abutting property. If the city council deems a project in the best interest of
the public, or otherwise necessary to ensure public safety, and if the city
intends to pay for the entire cost of the project, and if no assessments are to
be made against property abutting the project, then the city may provide for
construction, repair or maintenance of sidewalk improvements in accordance with
city criteria.
Sec. 10-251.   City-Initiated Sidewalk Improvements
   a.   If the city initiates a sidewalk improvement project that will involve
assessments against abutting property, the city council shall conduct a public
hearing pursuant to City Charter Sections
51  and
52 .  If the city council deems a project in the best interest of the public,
or otherwise necessary to ensure public safety, and after the notice and
hearing requirements of City Charter Section
51  are met, the city may provide for construction, repair, or maintenance of
sidewalk improvements in accordance with city criteria.
   b.   If a city-initiated sidewalk improvement project involving assessments
is approved by the city council, property owners shall be responsible for
payment of a maximum one-third of the cost of the sidewalk improvements
abutting their individual property.  The city shall be responsible for the
balance of the cost of improvements, although the city council may, but is not
required to, authorize a higher proportion of costs to be paid by the city, up
to and including the total cost of the project.
   c.   The city council reserves the right to refuse to participate in any
project deemed to be impractical, uneconomical, or otherwise not in the city’s
interest.
Sec. 10-252.   Citizen-Initiated Sidewalk Improvements
   a.   Upon written petition of 51 percent of the total number of involved
property owners, the development services engineer, with the concurrence of the
traffic engineer, will review the petition. If the development services
engineer determines that the project would be beneficial to the public as a
whole and would further the proper development of the city, the development
services engineer will then make a written recommendation for approval to the
city council.  Upon receipt of a written recommendation for approval from the
development services engineer, the city council will conduct a public hearing
pursuant to City Charter Sections
51  and
52 .  If the city council deems a project in the best interest of the public,
or otherwise necessary to ensure public safety, and after the notice and
hearing requirements of City Charter
Section 51  are met, the city may provide for construction, repair, or
maintenance of sidewalk improvements in accordance with city criteria. 
   b.   If a citizen-initiated sidewalk improvement project is approved by city
council, property owners will be responsible for payment of a maximum one-third
of the cost of the sidewalk improvements abutting their individual property. 
The city will be responsible for the balance of the cost of improvements,
although the city council may, but is not required to, authorize a higher
proportion of costs to be paid by the city, up to and including the total cost
of the project.  Also, adjoining property owners must dedicate to the city such
land that is necessary for standard public rights-of-way.
   c.   The city council reserves the right to refuse to participate in any
project deemed to be impractical, uneconomical, or otherwise not in the city’s
interest.
Sec. 10-253.   Liens Against Abutting Property
An assessment under sections
10-251 and
10-252 creates a lien on the owners’ abutting property for the assessed cost. 
Within 30 days after the work is done, if the owner fails or refuses to pay
such amount in full, the city will file with the Smith County Clerk a statement
of the expenses incurred by the city.  Such amount shall bear interest at the
rate of eight percent per annum from the date the city incurs the expense.

DIVISION G.
Traffic Impact Analysis
Sec. 10-270.   Purpose
The regulations of this division are intended to help ensure that the traffic
and transportation impacts of proposed developments are identified, evaluated,
and mitigated as necessary. The purpose of a transportation impact study is to
assess the effects that development will have on traffic conditions, transit
users, pedestrians, bicyclists, and neighborhood livability.
Sec. 10-271.   When Required
   a.   A traffic impact study is required at the time of application for
approval of any zoning map amendment (rezoning), special use permit or
preliminary subdivision plat, final plat, building permit, or other similar
site-specific development plan if:
      1.   the proposed development, or phases of development, or contiguous
tracts under the same ownership, would accommodate or could be expected to
generate 200 or more added vehicle trips to or from the site during the peak
traffic hour (based on the proposed development or the adjacent roads and
intersections); or
      2.   the proposed development, or phases of development, or contiguous
tracts under the same ownership, would accommodate or could be expected to
generate 2,000 or more added vehicle trips to or from the site during a 24-hour
period (based on the proposed development or the adjacent roads and
intersections).
   b.   In calculating the number of added vehicle trips expected to be
generated, trip generation rates must be obtained from the most recent editions
of Trip Generation and Trip Generation Handbook, published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE). Only “new” vehicle trips will be counted; no
pass-by or internal trip capture will be used in calculating “added vehicle
trips.”
   c.   The planning director may waive the requirement for a traffic impact
study when the applicant shows that the proposed development’s impact on
adjacent roads intersections, pedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities will
be minimal and insignificant, or will be no greater than those projected by a
traffic impact study prepared and submitted within the past two years for the
same site under the same or similar background conditions. The planning
director must document the reasons for any waiver.
Sec. 10-272.   Level of Service Standards
   a.   The traffic impact study must demonstrate that the proposed development
would not cause build-out-year, peak-hour levels of service on any arterial or
collector road or intersection within the study area to fall below Level of
Service (LOS) “D,” as defined by the latest edition of the highway capacity
manual, or, where the existing level of service is already LOS “E” that the
proposed development would not cause the LOS to fall to LOS F.
   b.   If the road segment or intersection is already LOS “F,” the traffic
impact study must demonstrate that the proposed development, with any proposed
road improvements, would not cause build-out year peak-hour operation to
degrade more than five percent of the total delay on any intersection approach.
   c.   To the extent that application proposes specific access points, the
study must also demonstrate that the proposed development would avoid unsafe
conditions on adjacent roads.
   d.   The traffic impact study must also address on-street parking impacts;
the availability of transit service and facilities and connections to transit;
impacts on immediate and adjacent neighborhoods; and the convenience and safety
effects on all modes of transportation.
Sec. 10-273.   Study Area
The traffic impact study must address the proposed development’s traffic
impacts on at least:
   a.   Roads, sidewalks, bicycle routes, transit facilities and intersections
within the development site, as designated by planning and development
department staff;
   b.   road segments, sidewalks, bicycle routes, transit facilities and
intersections abutting the development site as designated by planning and
development department staff; and
   c.   off-site road segments and intersections where traffic from the
proposed development is expected to account for at least 10% of the road’s or
intersection approach leg’s average daily traffic.
Sec. 10-274.   Qualifications
Traffic impact studies must be prepared by a licensed professional engineer.
Sec. 10-275.   Study Contents
Traffic impact studies must include charts, graphics, and narrative presenting
at least the following information:
   a.   A description of existing land uses and development intensities in the
study area, the location and characteristics of roads, sidewalks, bicycle
routes, transit facilities and intersections in the study area, and the
existing traffic volumes and conditions (including levels of service) of those
facilities;
   b.   A description of the location and traffic-related characteristics (land
use, intensity, expected date of full build-out and occupancy, vehicular access
points, pedestrian connections, bicycle routes and transit facilities and
characteristics, etc.) of the proposed development and other developments in
the study area that are under construction, approved, or pending approval, as
well as roadway and other transportation facilities and improvements in the
study area that are under construction, programmed, or planned;
   c.   Projections of future background traffic (existing vehicular,
pedestrian, bicycle and transit volumes forecasted to build-out year levels
based on agreed upon traffic growth rate) plus traffic generated by other
development in the study area that is under construction, approved, or pending
approval, future site traffic and total future traffic (the sum of future
background traffic and future site traffic);
   d.   Future background and site traffic projections must be made for the
peak hours (as identified by planning and development department staff) of the
adjacent road segments and intersections and for the development’s expected
full build-out and occupancy date, and must include trip generation, trip
distribution (using pre-approved distribution by planning and development
department staff), and traffic assignment estimates;
   e.   Studies of the proposed development’s incremental impacts on:
      1.   road capacity during peak hours at all site access points and at
road segments and intersections in the study area (including determination of
the level of service for the road segments and intersections, queuing versus
existing/proposed storage);
      2.   the need for signalization of intersections in the study area;
      3.   pedestrian, bicycle and transit-user safety and convenience; and
      4.   existing or potential high accident areas (as referenced in the
adopted transportation plan or determined by planning and development
department staff);
   f.   A qualitative study/review of sight distance at access points, when
required by planning and development department staff;
   g.   A description of the location, nature, and extent of site access and
transportation improvements and other measures recommended to mitigate any
failure to meet traffic operation standards due to the proposed development’s
traffic impacts, including the expected effectiveness of each mitigation
measure in addressing deficiencies, the feasibility of implementing the
measures, suggested allocation of responsibility for funding and implementing
the measures, the measures’ relationship to planned public transportation
improvements, and a suggested time schedule for the implementation of the
measures;
   h.   Résumés of the preparers of the study, demonstrating specific
education, training, and professional experience in traffic-related studies
and, if the study involves roadway or traffic signal design, traffic
engineering; and
   i.   Identification of all assumptions and data sources used in its
projections, studies, and recommendations.

Landscaping and Tree Preservation
Sec. 10-290.   Purpose
This division establishes the procedure, regulations, and standards whereby
landscape plans and tree preservation requirements will be reviewed by the city
for compliance with this code, and specifies the submittal and content
requirements for such landscape plans.  (Ord. No. 0-98-90, 11/18/98) (Ord. No.
0-2002-46, 10-9-02)
   a.   The purposes of the landscaping and tree preservation division of this
code are to:
      1.   improve the appearance and character of building setbacks and yards
in commercial areas, including off-street parking lots and open lot sales and
service areas;
      2.   implement Tyler 1st Comprehensive Plan policies regarding
landscaping and tree planting in parks, open spaces, parkways, scenic views,
and roadway corridors;  (Ord. No. 0-2014-33; 4/23/14)
      3.   protect healthy trees and promote the natural ecological,
environmental, and aesthetic qualities of the city; 
      4.   create sound and visual buffers between adjoining land uses, in
particular between residential areas and all nonresidential areas;
      5.   protect and increase property values in the city;
      6.   maintain and enhance a positive image of Tyler for the attraction of
new businesses and residents to the city;
      7.   prohibit the indiscriminate clearing of both residential and
nonresidential  property;
      8.   protect trees during construction; and
      9.   encourage site design and construction that contributes to the long-
term viability of existing trees.
Sec. 10-291.   Reserved
Sec. 10-292.   Landscaping Requirements
   a.   The landscape standards in this division apply to all land within the
city limits except for areas zoned AG, RE, R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-1D, R-2, or R-
MH, notwithstanding the requirement that each parcel in the aforementioned
districts are required to meet tree planting requirements set forth in Sec.
10-305 (C). (oRD. nO. 0-2011-45, 6/8/11)
   b.   Landscape standards in all planned districts will be regulated by the
requirements set forth in the final site development plan for each development
project. In instances where the base zone landscaping requirements differ from
any requirements set forth in a site development plan, the more restrictive
regulations will govern.
   c.   Landscape requirements become applicable to each individual lot at the
time a building permit application is made.  All landscape requirements of this
code will continue after the building permit is issued to any owner or
subsequent owner. (Ord. No. 0-98-90, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2011-45, 6/8/11)
Sec. 10-293.   Reserved
Sec. 10-294.   Landscape Plan Requirements
A landscape plan is required and must be submitted upon application for a
building permit.  The landscape plan may be a separate site plan, or when
feasible, the landscape plan information may be included on the building site
plan.  It is recommended that landscape plans be prepared by a professional
landscape architect or landscape contractor.  The landscape plan must include:
      1.   The location of existing boundary lines and dimensions of the lot.
      2.   The location of existing and proposed utility easements on or
adjacent to the lot and the location of overhead power lines and any
underground utilities.
      3.   A plant schedule listing the name and size of all plant materials. 
Botanical nomenclature as well as common names must be listed.  All canopy
trees must be identified as containerized or balled and burlapped. 
      4.   The location, size, and type of vegetation of new and existing plant
materials to be planted or retained in the proposed landscaped areas.
      5.   An indication of how the developer plans to use protective fencing
to barricade existing trees, which are to be retained, in order to prevent
damage to the trees during construction. The location and size of the fencing
must be indicated.
      6.   A note indicating the installation of the irrigation system covering
the required landscape areas has been completed or a date by which it will be
completed. 
      7.   The location of existing development, adjacent land uses, and
roadways.
      8.   Information necessary for verifying whether the minimum required
landscaping area has been met under Sec.
10-295.
      9.   A statement of compliance indicating the total square footage of
landscaping area required, including the number of trees and shrubs, and a
calculation to verify that the number, size, and type of vegetation listed on
the plant schedule will render the proposed development to be in compliance
with this code.
   a.   Plan Revisions
      Minor revisions to landscape plans are acceptable if there is no
reduction in the quality of plant material or no significant change in size or
location of plant materials, and if the new plants are of the same general
category (i.e., shade, ornamental, or evergreen trees) and have the same
general characteristics (mature height, crown spread) as the materials being
replaced.  Proposed materials must also be compatible with the area to ensure
healthy plant growth.  If these criteria are not fulfilled, changes to approved
plans must be resubmitted and reviewed for approval.  (Ord. No. 0-2002-46, 10-
09-02)
Sec. 10-295.   Landscape Area Requirements
   a.   The landscaping requirements will be determined by the total square
footage of the lot less any areas exempted by phased development or
classification as floodway or undisturbed area.
   b.   The minimum width of required landscaping in the street yard is 10 ft.
for properties abutting major arterial streets.
   c.   The minimum required area of landscaping is 15 percentof the total lot
area, except for lots zoned for manufacturing.  The minimum area of landscaping
for lots zoned M-1 or M-2 is 2½ percent of the total lot area.  Each existing
tree, which is maintained in a living and growing condition, may be credited
towards the required landscaped area according to the following schedule:
 
Existing Saved Tree Credit
10” – 12” DBH 200 square feet of landscaped area
15” or greater DBH250 square feet of landscaped area
Credits may not exceed 25% of the required landscaped area.
d.   Required tree plantings.
   Option   Tree Requirement/Square Footage    Tree Type
   A      One tree/750 square feet         Large Shade Trees
   B      One tree/625 square feet         Large Shade Trees, Medium Trees, and
Small Trees
   C      One tree/500 square feet         Medium Trees and Small Trees
   Note:  Trees selected for planting must be on the approved tree list set
forth in subsection f. (Ord. No. 0-2010-20, 3/10/10)
                         1.     For required tree plantings:
                            (a)     At least 1/3 of the trees planted must be
large shade trees, or
             (b)  At least 1/3 of the trees planted must be medium trees; and
             (c)  No more than 1/3 of the required tree plantings may be small
trees as shown on the approved tree list.  A minimum of one tree is required
for all developments.  All required trees must have a minimum DBH of 2" at the
time of planting.  Trees with a multiple trunk growth characteristic shall have
no more than five main trunks.
                   2.  When planted with large shade trees solely, a minimum of
one tree per 750 square feet, or fraction thereof, is required.  Trees planted
in order to satisfy this requirement must be classified as large shade trees in
the approved tree list in subsection f.
                   3.  When planted with a combination of large shade trees,
medium trees and small trees, a minimum of one tree per 625 square feet, or
fraction thereof, is required.  Trees planted in order to satisfy this
requirement must include a mixture of shade, medium, and small trees as
identified in the approved tree list in subsection f.
                   4.  When planted with a combination of medium trees and
small trees, a minimum of one tree per 500 square feet, or fraction thereof, is
required.  Trees planted in order to satisfy this requirement must include a
mixture of shade, medium, and small trees as identified in the approved tree
list in subsection f.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-32; 3/25/09)
   e.   Tree credits. 
      1.   Each existing tree which is maintained in a living and growing
condition may be credited towards the number of required trees according to the
following schedule.  (Ord. No. 0-2010-20, 3/10/10)
 
Existing Saved Trees Credit
6”-9” DBH        3 Trees
10”- 12” DBH     4 Trees
12” or greater DBH 5 Trees
 
      2.   Of the required landscape area, a minimum of one shrub per 200
square feet, or fraction thereof, is required.  Shrubs planted to satisfy this
requirement must be a minimum size of two gallons. 
      3.   Up to 75 percent of the required shrubs must be planted in the
required interior parking lot landscaping islands or be included in the
required bufferyards pursuant to
Article VI, Division B.
      4.   Each existing tree or newly planted tree which is maintained in a
living and growing condition may be credited towards the required number of
shrubs according to the following schedule:
 
Existing Saved Trees Credit
2” – 6” DBH    4 shrubs
7” – 9” DBH    6 shrubs
10” – 12” DBH  8 shrubs
15” or greater DBH 10 shrubs
 
Credit in areas zoned R-MF, AR, PMF, PMXD-1, PMXD-2, and may not exceed 50% of
the required trees or shrubs.
Credit for saving an existing tree cannot count toward more than one landscape
element for which such credit is granted in this chapter, i.e., double counting
of tree credits is not allowed.  (Ord. No. 0-2017-100; 11/8/17)
      5.   All mandated bufferyards count towards the requirements.  Beyond
that, no more than 10 percent of the required landscape area or required number
of trees to be planted may be located at the rear of the property.  The
planning director has the authority to grant an exception to this requirement
in situations where tree preservationareas are located at the rear of the
property regardless of whether the trees saved are credited toward the tree
planting requirement or the trees are saved are supplementing the required
number of trees to be planted.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-19; 3/11/09) (Ord. No. 0-2009-
32; 3/25/09)

(Ord. No. 0-2009-32; 3/25/09) (Ord. No. O-2018-17; 2/14/18)
         g.  Properties in the DBAC zoning district are not required to have
landscaping except when off street parking is installed; however, street trees
and plantings in the right-of-way are          encouraged where appropriate.
      1.   Off street parking in DBAC is subject to Section 10-299, Parking Lot
Landscaping.
      2.   A minimum 3'wide landscape strip shall be provided between the
parking areas and all public rights-of-way except for alleys.
      3.   The landscape strip shall include a minimum of 1 tree form shrub for
each 15 linear feet of frontage, or portion thereof, measured along the right-
of-way adjacent to the parking areas.  Plantings shall comply with the
requirements in the Approved Tree Form Shrub List for Parking Lot Screening
DBAC Zoning District in Section 10-342.d.
      4.   Multi-story parking structures and enclosed parking areas may be
exempt from these requirements if designed to resemble a building front
adjacent to the right-of-way, subject to approval of the Planning Director. 
(Ord. No. 0-2012-38; 4/25/12)
 
Sec. 10-296.   Reduction in Required Landscape Area
The required landscape area can be reduced through the following techniques:
      (a)   Phased Development 
         Each phase of a phased project must comply with this code.  Phase
lines, if drawn, must be drawn 20feet or more from developed site elements
(parking, buildings, ponds, etc.).  The portion left for subsequent phases must
remain of developable size and quality.  No building permit will be issued for
a subsequent phase of a project until all requirements of this code have been
met.
      (b)   Floodway
         On sites where a floodway exists, the floodway area will be subtracted
from the total lot area when calculating landscape requirements.  Therefore,
trees, shrubs, or groundcover in this area will not be applicable in meeting
the landscaping requirements for the development of the property.
      (c)   Street Trees
         Abutting parkways are required to be planted with grass and left
unpaved except for sidewalks and driveways. A one-for-one credit for street
trees planted in lieu of onsite trees will be granted for street trees planted
at any point along the linear frontage of parcel, including trees planted in
the roadway median.  In the event that two parcels facing one another across a
roadway request credit for street trees planted or saved, each parcel will be
granted such credit so long as the trees are in a parkway behind the curb line
on the respective sides of the streets.  Credit for street trees planted in a
roadway median will only be granted once, on a first come, first served basis. 
Any landscape and tree planting made in the parkway or roadway median must be
in conformance with the requirements of the master street plan in Artivle V,
Division A of this code.  Such areas must be irrigated. Applicants must enter
into a maintenance agreement with the City for on-going tree maintenance.
      (d)   Undisturbed Area
         On sites where the planning director has determined that undisturbed
area exists, the area will be subtracted from the total lot area when
calculating landscape requirements.  Therefore, trees, shrubs, or groundcover
in this area will not be applicable in meeting the landscape requirements for
development of the property.  No building permit will be issued for the
development within the undisturbed area until all requirements of this code
have been met.  (Ord. No. 0-98-90, 11/18/98; Ord. No. 0-98-98, 12/23/98)
Sec. 10-297.   Landscape Location Requirements
   a.   For a lot abutting one street, a minimum of 30 percent of the
landscaping area must be located in the street yards.  The remaining percentage
of landscaping must be reasonably dispersed throughout the lot. The
distribution of landscaping may be amended at the discretion of the planning
and zoning director in order to ensure the maximum benefit of the required
landscaping.

IMAGES/0-0-0-80556.jpg]
 
   b.   For a corner lot, a minimum of 45 percent of the landscaping area must
be located in the street yards.  The remaining percentage of landscaping must
be reasonably dispersed throughout the lot.  The distribution of landscaping
may be amended at the discretion of the planning and zoning director in order
to ensure the maximum benefit of the required landscaping.

IMAGES/0-0-0-80558.jpg]
 
   c.   Trees planted in the street yard must be planted, on average, every 40
linear feet, but may be grouped in the street yard in such a way that:
      1.   they will not block the view of traffic entering or existing the
property
      2.   the primary building entrance, or indication thereof, is visible
from the roadway;
      3.   and the species of trees selected do not crowd or otherwise inhibit
the growth of other trees in the same grouping.
   d.   For a lot abutting three or more streets, landscaping must be
reasonably dispersed so that each street yard has some landscaping.
   e.   All existing undergrowth in a protected area must remain until
construction is complete and may be removed at that time.
   f.   Any surface of the street yard not occupied by trees, shrubs, planting
beds, signs or other permitted fixtures must be planted with sod or other
suitable groundcover.
Sec. 10-298.   Irrigation Required
Landscaped areas in all nonresidential developments are required to have an
irrigation system in accordance with Section
10-308, Irrigation Standards.
Sec. 10-299.   Parking Lot Landscaping
   a.   Landscaped islands are required in all parking lots parking lots in
excess of more than 20 spaces.
   b.   One landscaped island is required for every 10 parking spaces and at
both ends of each row of 10 or more parking spaces. Islands may be grouped as
long as there is no more than 20 parking spaces in a row without a landscape
island.  (Ord. No. 0/2009/19; 3/11/09)

IMAGES/0-0-0-80560.jpg]
 
   c.   Each landscaped island must be at least 50 square feet; have a minimum
dimension of five feet; and must include at least one tree. Grouped islands
must be at least 100 square feet; have a minimum dimension of ten feet; and
must include at least one tree. Two landscaped islands that are connected and
located as to span two rows of adjacent parking spaces may utilize one large
species tree. The remaining area must be landscaping material, including
shrubs, turf, or planted groundcover, none of which may exceed three feet in
height (Ord. No. 0-2017-69; 8/23/17).

Sec. 10-300.   Landscape Requirements for Nonconforming Uses
   a.   Classification of Nonconforming Developments
      Land developed with a building or structure, which is in lawful use at
the effective date of this code, which was in lawful use as of September 9,
1992, and land, which does not conform to the landscape requirements of this
code, but is subsequently annexed to the city, will have non-conforming use
status with respect to this code.
   b.   Regulation of Nonconforming Developments
      1.   The lawful use of a building or other development as described in
subsection A above may be continued although such development does not comply
with the landscape requirements herein.  However, voluntary compliance with
these landscape requirements and landscape enhancement is encouraged.
      2.   The repair or restoration of a building or other development to its
prior condition after being damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, wind,
flood, tornado or other accident or weather phenomena, will not require that
such building or other development comply with the landscape requirements of
this code, provided a building permit for the repair or restoration is obtained
within 12 months of the date the damage occurred.
      3.   The expansion of an existing building, or the construction of one or
more additional buildings on the same lot as the existing building, will not
require compliance with the landscape requirements of this code provided:
         (a)   That the expansion of the existing building or the construction
of the additional building(s) will not result in the encroachment of any wall
building line into an existing street yard; or
         (b)   Where the expansion of the existing building or construction of
any additional building(s) will result in the encroachment of a wall building
line into an existing street yard, the gross floor area (GFA) of the addition,
or the total gross floor area of all buildings to be constructed in the street
yard, must not exceed 25 percent of the GFA of the existing building.  (Ord.
No. 0-98-90, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2002-46, 10/09/02)
      4.   Regardless of any exemptions in part 3, non-conforming developments
which
contain parkways with impermeable surfaces shall be planted with grass or other
typical permeable landscaped ground cover and left unpaved except for sidewalks
and driveways with any expansion of existing buildings or construction of new
buildings in the street yard. The established Master Street Plan right-of-way
width will determine the maximum parkway width for the purposes of this
requirement. (Ord. No. 0-2018-83; 10/24/18)
Sec. 10-301.   Tree Preservation Requirements
a.   Applicability
      The requirements of this code regarding clearing of land without a
building permit will apply to all land within the city limits, as now or
hereafter set, in all multifamily, commercial, office, and manufacturing
districts.
b.   Trees in Agricultural Zone
      There is no tree preservation requirement in the Agricultural Zone.
c.   Existing and Approved Right-of-Way, Shared Access Easements, and Public
Easements
      All construction and maintenance activity within existing or approved (as
shown on an approved preliminary plat) public right-of-way, shared access
easements, or easements are exempt from the requirements for tree protection
and replacement specified herein. (Ord. No. 0-2014-97; 10/22/14)
d.   Other Government Entities
      The tree preservation requirements apply to all private and institutional
developments and all development on city property, including properly within
the MU-O Municipal Use Overlay District. The requirements do not apply to
property owned by other governmental entities or taxing entities.  However,
voluntary compliance is encouraged.
e.   Franchise and Other Utility Companies
      All utility company projects are exempt from the requirements for tree
protection and replacement specified herein when clearing public easements and
existing right-of-way.
f.   Public Tree Care
      The city will have the right to plant, prune, and maintain trees, street
trees and park trees within the lines of all streets, alleys, avenues, lanes,
squares, and public grounds, as may be necessary to insure public safety or to
preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public grounds. The city
may remove or cause or order to be removed, any tree or part thereof which is
in an unsafe condition or which by reason of its nature is injurious to sewers,
electric power lines, gas lines, water lines, or other public improvements, or
is affected with any injurious fungus, insect, or other pest.  The management
of trees on City property shall be the responsibility of the City’s Parks and
Recreation Department.  The City’s Parks and Recreation Department  shall be
responsible for the creation and implementation of a five-year management  plan
for the planting, maintenance, and removal of trees on City property.  This
management plan is to be updated annually.  The City’s Parks and Recreation
Department shall be responsible for reporting the accomplishments of the five-
year plan to the Parks Board on an annual basis.  City owned property does not
include publicly dedicated rights-of-way until the City accepts the
improvements for maintenance.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-88; 8/26/09)
Sec. 10-302.   Pre-Development Restrictions on Land Clearing
   It is the intent of this Division to minimize the visual impact of tree
removal by retaining or replanting tree buffers around property boundaries.  A
property owner, developer, or contractor must obtain a clearing and grading
permit prior to any agricultural timbering, predevelopment clearing, or
depositing of fill on an undeveloped site.  Properties, other than the minimum
buffer area specified herein, may be underbrushed without obtaining a grading
permit.  For the minimum buffer area specified here, underbrushing may be
undertaken as long as no mechanized equipment, other than a chainsaw, is used
in the underbrush clearing.  In no case may living and healthy trees 6" DBH or
larger be removed without a permit.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-19; 3/11/09) (Ord. No. 0-
2009-88; 8/26/09)
Sec. 10-303.   Clearing and Grading Permit Required
   Pursuant to Sec. 10-527 of this code, a clearing and grading permit must be
obtained from the development services engineer prior to the commencement of
any development, excavation, grading, regrading, landfilling, beaming, paving,
diking, clearing and grubbing, or other earth changes made to any property
within the city.  A separate permit is required for each separate, non-
contiguous site or lot.  (Ord. No. 0-99-19; 2/24/99)
a.   Tree Inventory
Accompanying the permit application, a 6” DBH or larger tree inventory shall be
submitted according to the following:
                        1.  The approximate location and diameter at breast
height (DBH) of all living trees which are six inches in DBH in size or larger
when measured at 4 ½ feet above the ground within a 40’ buffer area along any
street frontage, and 25’ buffer area on all other property boundaries.
                        2.  A tree clearing/planting plan shall also be
provided detailing the proposed site buffers and remaining trees after
clearing.  The plan will also list the total number of existing 6” DBH or
larger trees and the proposed number of remaining 6” DBH and/or 2” DBH
replanted trees after clearing within buffer areas.
b.      Approval Criteria for Zoning Requiring Tree Preservation 
   The Development Services Engineer will approve a clearing and grading permit
if the application demonstrates that the following conditions in this
subsection will be met.
   A 40-foot-wide undisturbed area is left in place along 75 percent of the
street frontage, a 25-foot-wide undisturbed area is left along 75 percent of
the rear property line, and a 25-foot-wide undisturbed area” is left along 75
percent of the side property lines.  The understory growth is to be left intact
to enhance the tree buffer.  Each “undisturbed area” must contain an average of
one tree per 314 square feet.  Where trees do not exist to meet this standard,
2” DBH replacement trees of a medium or large size and species from the
approved tree list that are highly drought tolerant are to be placed within the
buffer within 12 months from permit date.  In no event shall the number of tree
plantings required within the buffers be greater than the total number of 6”
DBH trees  removed within the entire property as the applicant may choose to
demonstrate by a tree inventory of the remainder of the property.  If new
plantings are required, the applicant must demonstrate adequate watering
methods to ensure survivability.  The applicant must replace and ensure
survival of any replanted trees that may die within a one year period from the
date replanting the buffer takes place.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-19; 3/11/09 (Ord. No.
0-2009-88; 8/26/09) (Ord. 0-2011-45, 6/8/11)
Sec. 10-304.   Exceptions and Tree removal without a Permit
   a.    Exceptions.  If the property owner, developer, or contractor
determines that the restrictions set forth in (1) and (2) above cannot be met,
the development services engineer may grant a variance for the pre-development
clearing of land if property owner agrees to mitigate the clearing of land by
replanting the buffer area as specified above.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-88; 8/26/09) 
(Ord. No. 0-2010-20, 3/10/10)
   b.   Tree Removal without a Permit.  It is unlawful to conduct a tree
clearing without a valid Clearing and Grading Permit when required by this
Chapter.  Where tree clearing takes place in advance of a Clearing and Grading
Permit, the owner shall mitigate all tree removal in accordance with this
Chapter.  Tree planting must occur within six months of any such violation. 
Additionally, failure to obtain a Clearing and Grading Permit when required may
result in a fine pursuant to City Code Section 1-4.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-88; 8/26/
09) (Ord. No. 0-2010-20, 3/10/10)
Sec. 10-305.   Tree Planting Standards and Specifications
   a.   Plant Criteria
      1.   All plant materials planted in order to satisfy this code must be of
a species, which will conform to the selection criteria of this code.
         (a)   Plant materials must be either acceptable native plants to the
Tyler area, or plants that are known to be acclimated to the East Texas region.
         (b)   The species of plant chosen must be adaptable to the specific
environment and conditions in which it will be planted; i.e., soils, water
availability, height limitations and shade.
      2.   Trees and shrubs planted in order to satisfy this code must conform
to the minimum size specified.
         (a)   All trees must be a minimum two inches in DBH (4.5 feet above
grade); a minimum branching height of six feet; and a minimum overall height of
eight feet at the time
            of planting. (Ord. No. 0-2015-67; 6/24/15)
         (b)   Shrubs must be a minimum size of two gallons.
      3.   Trees must be selected so as to avoid those species known to cause
damage to public improvements.
      4.   Trees selected for planting must be on a list of approved trees that
is available from the planning director.
      5.   Artificial plants are not acceptable in satisfying this code.
   b.   Planting Requirements
      1.   A professional horticulturist/nurseryman should be consulted to
determine the proper time to move and install plant material so that stress to
the plant is minimized.  In the event weather conditions are not suitable for
planting, with the approval of the planning director, and prior to issuance of
a certificate of occupancy, an irrevocable letter of credit assigned to the
city must be provided to cover the cost of postponed planting.
      2.   The owner or contractor must furnish and install and/or dig, ball,
burlap, and transplant all plant materials listed on the plant schedule. 
      3.   Trees must not be planted so near to sewers, sidewalks, or other
public improvements as to cause damage to such improvements. 
      4.   Sight clearance on all sites must comply with Sec. 18-2 of the Tyler
City Code.
      5.   The owner or contractor must excavate all plant pits, vine pits,
hedge trenches and shrub beds as follows:
         (a)   All pits must be generally circular in outline, with vertical
sides.  The tree pit must be deep enough to allow one-eighth of the ball to be
above the existing grade.  Plants must rest on undisturbed existing soil or
well-compacted backfill.  The tree pit must be a minimum of nine inches larger
on every side than the ball of the tree.
         (b)   If areas are designated as shrub beds or hedge trenches, they
must be cultivated to at least 18 inches in depth.  Areas designated for ground
covers and vines must be cultivated to at least 12 inches in depth.
      6.   Each tree, shrub, or vine must be pruned in an appropriate manner,
in accordance with accepted standard practice.  Broken or bruised branches must
be removed with clean cuts made on an angle from the bark ridge to the branch
collar, no flush cuts, to minimize the area cut.  All cuts must be made with
sharp tools and all edges should be trimmed smooth.
      7.   All trenches and shrub beds must be edged and cultivated to the
lines shown on the drawing.  The area around isolated plants must be edged and
cultivated to the full diameter of the pit.  Sod that has been removed and
stacked must be used to trim the edges of all excavated areas to the neat lines
of the plant pit saucers, the edges of shrub areas, hedge trenches, and vine
pockets.
      8.   After cultivation, all plant materials must be mulched with approved
material over the entire area of the bed or saucer according to generally
accepted landscape practices. (Ord. No. 0-98-90, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2002-46,
10-09-02)
9.    In nonresidential districts, where newly planted trees are not able to
stand up on their own, trees shall be staked with an at-grade root ball
securing system.  The system shall securely anchor the root ball, while
allowing the trunk and the crown to move naturally.  The system shall not use
materials and methods that penetrate or damage the root ball.  Above grade
staking systems such as "T" posts with wires, hoses, straps, or guy wires
wrapped around the tree trunk, shall not be allowed unless authorized by the
Planning Director in consultation with the Urban Forester. (Ord. No. 0-2016-76;
08/24/16)
 
 
   c.   Trees in Residential Zones
      Property zoned RE, R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-1D, R-2, R-MH, PUR, and PXR are
required to provide a minimum one tree per residential lot prior to certificate
of occupancy and will be subject to any additional tree requirements in the
subdivision standards provided in
Article IV of this code.  (Ord. No. 0-2011-45, 6/8/11)
   d.   Pre-Construction Standards
      1.   Tree Flagging
         All saved trees on the subject property within 40 feet of a
construction area or surface improvements such as driveway, walks, etc. must be
flagged with bright fluorescent orange vinyl tape wrapped around the main trunk
at a height of four feet or more such that the tape is very visible to workers
operating construction equipment. This does not include the flagging of all
protected trees adjacent to right-of-way within approved residential
subdivisions during the construction of the roadway.
      2.   Open Space Flagging
         All trees or groups of trees within areas intended to be saved as open
space must be enclosed with fluorescent orange tape along all areas of possible
access or intrusion by construction equipment. Tape must be supported at a
maximum of 25 feet intervals by wrapping trees or other approved methods.
Single incident access for the purposes of clearing underbrush is allowed.
      3.   Protective Fencing
         In those situations where a saved tree is so close to the construction
area that construction equipment might infringe on the root system or is within
20 feet of the construction area, a protective fencing will be required between
the outer limits of the critical root zone of the tree and the construction
activity area.  Four foot high protective fencing must be supported at a
maximum of 10 foot (intervals by approved methods. All protective fencing must
be in place prior to commencement of any site work and remain in place until
all exterior work has been completed.
      4.   Bark Protection
         In situations where a saved tree remains in the immediate area of
intended construction, the tree must be protected by enclosing the entire
circumference of the tree with 2" x 4" lumber encircled with wire or other
means that do not damage the tree. The intent here is to protect the bark of
the tree against incidental contact by large construction equipment.
   e.   Tree Preservation and Care During Construction
      1.   Each individual tree or shrub may be credited only once.
      2.   Existing trees to be preserved for landscape credit must be clearly
marked.
      3.   The following activities are be prohibited within areas to be
preserved or the limits of the critical root zone of any tree to be saved for
landscape credit:
         (a)   Material Storage
            No materials intended for use in construction or waste materials
accumulated due to excavation or demolition may be placed within the limits of
the critical root zone of any protected tree.
         (b)   Equipment Cleaning/Liquid Disposal
            No equipment may be cleaned or other liquids deposited or allowed
to flow overland within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected
tree. This includes, without limitation, paint, oil, solvents, asphalt,
concrete, mortar, or similar materials.
         (c)   Tree Attachments
            No signs, wires, or other attachments, other than those of a
protective nature, may be attached to any protected tree. Fencing attached to a
tree via “U" nails or bent nails when only at points of tangency with the tree
are allowed.
         (d)   Vehicular Traffic
            No vehicular and/or construction equipment traffic or parking may
take place within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree
other than on an existing street pavement. This restriction does not apply to
signing incident access within the critical root zone for purposes of clearing
underbrush, establishing the building pad and associated lot grading, vehicular
traffic necessary for routine utility maintenance or emergency restoration of
utility service or routine mowing operations.
         (e)   Grade Changes
            No grade changes may be allowed within the limits of the critical
root zone of any protected tree unless adequate construction methods are
approved by the planning director or if grading is as directed by the
development services engineer.
         (f)   Impervious Paving
            No paving with asphalt, concrete or other impervious materials in a
manner which may reasonably be expected to kill a tree may be placed within the
limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree except as otherwise
allowed in this code.
         (g)   Saved Trees
            A saved tree will be considered to be preserved only if a minimum
of 75 percent of the critical root zone is maintained at undisturbed natural
grade and no more than 25 percent of the canopy is removed due to building
encroachment.
         (h)   Barricaded Areas
            Areas to remain preserved are to be barricaded so that construction
practices in the field will protect existing trees from compaction of soil,
changes in grades and damage from machines. 
   f.   Permanent Construction Methods
      1.   Boring
         Boring of utilities under saved trees is required in those
circumstances where it is not possible to trench around the critical root zone
of the saved tree. When required, the length of the bore must be the width of
the critical root zone at a minimum and must be a minimum depth of 48 inches.
      2.   Grade Change
         In the event the grade change within the critical root zone of a
protected tree exceeds the limits noted in subsection (E)(3)(e) herein, the
procedures noted in the Design Guidelines will be required.
      3.   Trenching
         Trenching across the critical root zone of any saved tree must be
avoided. Although this subsection is not intended to prohibit the placement of
underground services such as electric, phone, gas, etc., the placement of these
utilities is encouraged to be located outside of the critical root zone of
saved trees. Irrigation system trenching must be placed outside of the critical
root zone with only the minimum required single head supply line allowed within
that area placed radially to the tree trunk.
      4.   Root Pruning
         All roots two inches or larger in diameter which are exposed as a
result of trenching or other excavation must be cut off square with a sharp
medium tooth saw and covered with pruning compound within two hours of initial
exposure.
   g.   Maintenance
      1.   The owner or agent is responsible for the maintenance of all
landscaping, which must be maintained in good condition so as to present a
healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and must be kept free from refuse and
debris.  Any plant that dies must be replaced with another living plant that
complies with the approved landscape plan within 120 days after death, season
permitting.
      2.   The owner or agent is responsible for replacement of dead

            b.      Spacing.
                1.    The maximum spacing between emission devices must not
exceed the manufacturer's published radius or spacing of the device(s). The
radius or spacing is determined by referring to the manufacturer's published
specifications for a specific emission device at a specific operating pressure.
                      2.    New irrigation systems shall not utilize above-
ground spray emission devices in landscapes that are less than 48 inches not
including the impervious surfaces in either length or width and which contain
impervious pedestrian or vehicular traffic surfaces along two or more
perimeters. If pop-up sprays or rotary sprinkler heads are used in a new
irrigation system, the sprinkler heads must direct flow away from any adjacent
surface and shall not be installed closer than four inches from a hardscape,
such as, but not limited to, a building foundation, fence, concrete, asphalt,
pavers, or stones set with mortar.
              3.    Narrow paved walkways, jogging paths, golf cart paths or
other small areas located in cemeteries, parks, golf courses or other public
areas may be exempted from this requirement if the runoff drains into a
landscaped area.
            c.       Water pressure. Emission devices must be installed to
operate at the minimum and not above the maximum sprinkler head pressure as
published by the manufacturer for the nozzle and head spacing that is used.
Methods to achieve the water pressure requirements include, but are not limited
to, flow control valves, a pressure regulator, or pressure compensating spray
heads.

soil conditions, and hydrological requirements.
            f.         Matched precipitation rate. Zones must be designed and
installed so that all of the emission devices in that zone irrigate at the same
precipitation rate.
            g.      Irrigation systems shall not spray water over surfaces made
of concrete, asphalt, brick, wood, stones set with mortar, or any other
impervious material, such as, but not limited to, walls, fences, sidewalks,
streets, etc.
          h.         Master valve. When provided, a master valve shall be
installed on the discharge side of the backflow prevention device on all new
installations.
            i.         PVC pipe primer solvent. All new irrigation systems that
are installed using PVC pipe and fittings shall be primed with a colored primer
prior to applying the PVC cement in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code
(Section 316) or the International Plumbing Code (Section 605).
            j.      Rain or moisture shut-off devices or other technology. All
new automatically controlled irrigation systems must include sensors or other

an isolation valve between the water meter and the backflow prevention device.
            l.       Depth coverage of piping. Piping in all irrigation systems
must be installed according to the manufacturer's published specifications for
depth coverage of piping.
               1.    If the manufacturer has not published specifications for
depth coverage of piping, the piping must be installed to provide minimum depth
coverage of six inches of select backfill, between the top of the pipe and the
natural grade of the topsoil. All portions of the irrigation system that fail
to meet this standard must be noted on the irrigation plan. If the area being
irrigated has rock at a depth of six inches or less, select backfill may be
mounded over the pipe. Mounding must be noted on the irrigation plan and
discussed with the irrigation system owner or owner's representative to address
any safety issues.
               2.    If a utility, man-made structure, or roots create an
unavoidable obstacle, which makes the six-inch depth coverage requirement
impractical, the piping shall be installed to provide a minimum of two inches
of select backfill between the top of the pipe and the natural grade of the
topsoil.
               3.    All trenches and holes created during installation of an
irrigation system must be backfilled and compacted to the original grade.
            m.     Wiring irrigation systems.

               4.   Underground electrical wiring that connects an automatic
controller to any electrical component of the irrigation system must be buried
with a minimum of six inches of select backfill.
            n.    Water contained within the piping of an irrigation system is
deemed to be non-potable. No drinking or domestic water usage, such as, but not
limited to, filling swimming pools or decorative fountains, shall be connected
to an irrigation system. If a hose bib (an outdoor water faucet that has hose
threads on the spout) is connected to an irrigation system for the purpose of
providing supplemental water to an area, the hose bib must be installed using a
quick coupler key on a quick coupler installed in a covered purple valve box
and the hose bib and any hoses connected to the bib must be labeled "non
potable, not safe for drinking." An isolation valve must be installed upstream
of a quick coupler connecting a hose bib to an irrigation system.
            o.    Beginning January 1, 2010, either a licensed irrigator or a
licensed irrigation technician shall be on-site at all times while the
landscape irrigation system is being installed. When an irrigator is not
onsite, the irrigator shall be responsible for ensuring that a licensed
irrigation technician is on-site to supervise the installation of the
irrigation system.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-19; 3/11/09)

regulations: 
   a.   All such uses must be completely enclosed by an eight-foot-high solid
fence of redwood, fiberglass, aluminum, masonry, or materials approved by the
planning director, provided, however, that gate(s) for ingress and egress are
permitted.
   b.   The height of the fence may be reduced to six feet when the use is
conducted at an elevation two feet or more above the crown of the adjacent
roadway.
   c.   By the authority of the building official, a steel mesh fence may be
substituted, for a solid fence along the rear property line and up to the rear
3/4 of the side property lines when the use abuts a manufacturing zone and the

   g.   The use of discarded, disabled, or wrecked automobiles, trucks,
equipment, appliances, or parts for advertising, signage or for identification
purposes is prohibited.
   h.   Whenever an owner or representative of a non-conforming use under this
code is granted [M-1 or M-2 zoning,] such person will have six months in which
to bring the existing use into compliance with this chapter.
Sec. 10-345.   Alternative Compliance
The planning director may approve alternative buffering and screening plans for
any of the uses or accessory structures and uses for which screen standards are
provided above. The planning director may deem an alternative landscape plan
compliant with this article if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed
alternative meets at least two of the following criteria:
   a.   the alternative landscaping proposed will be functionally equivalent to
the required standards in terms of coverage, shading, buffering, and tree
canopy
   b.   the proposed alternative to these standards would represent an
aesthetic improvement over what is required herein, through the installation of
a the variety of plants, flowers, trees, and shrubs in innovative patterns and
arrangements;
   c.   the natural land characteristics or existing vegetation on the proposed
development site would achieve the intent of this article;
   d.   the proposed alternative screening materials will achieve an effect
that is equivalent to the screening standards of this article;
   e.   the required landscaping or buffering would be ineffective at maturity
due to topography or the location of improvements on the site; or
   f.   the proposed alternative represents a plan that is, in the opinion of
the planning director, as good or better than a plan prepared in strict
compliance with the other standards of this article.
Sec. 10-346 - 349.   Reserved
DIVISION E.
Off-Street Parking and Loading
Sec. 10-350.   Purpose
The purpose of the off-street parking and loading regulations is to ensure the
provision of adequate off-street parking, loading and maneuvering facilities
for all land uses in the city.  The standards and regulatory procedures set
forth in this division are intended to regulate parking facilities so that
there is sufficient parking available for each land use and that the parking
spaces are functional and adequate to serve the parking demand generated or
associated with a particular land use.
Sec. 10-351.   General Requirements
   a.   All parking must comply with all the regulations of this code
pertaining to parking.
   b.   The standards set forth in this division are minimum requirements. 
   c.   Except in DBAC, INT (not on arterial streets), PMXD-1, and PMXD-2, no
parking or maneuvering will be allowed within the street right-of-way between
the curb, improved roadway, or travel portion of the rights-of-way and the
common right-of-way property line, unless approved by the planning director. It
is the responsibility of the property owner to certify at the time formal
application is made for a building permit or certificate of occupancy and
compliance that the site provides sufficient space and facilities necessary to
assure that no vehicle parking or maneuvering activity will take place on
public right-of-ways or on private property not under the property owner's
control.
   d.   Except in DBAC, INT (not on arterial streets), PMXD-1, and PMXD-2, no
public street, right-of-way, or public property may be used to gain direct
access to a parking space except that an alley may be used for maneuvering
space to reach a parking space, and public streets may be used to gain direct
access to residential usage. (Ord. No. 0-2018-83; 10/24/18)
   e.   No future on-street parking will be allowed other than parallel. (Ord.
No. O-2000-68, 9/6/00) 
   f.   In all districts, except DBAC, there shall be provided at the time of
any occupancy of a building or land use change, a sufficient number of parking
spaces to meet the parking requirements of the new occupancy or land use,
unless otherwise stated in this Article. (Ord. No. 0-2010-119; 11/10/10)
   g.   No building may be constructed or enlarged, nor may any use be
expanded, if such action will eliminate existing required off-street parking
spaces.
   h.   Off-street parking spaces must be located on the same lot or tract
occupied by the principal use or in accordance with the off-site parking
requirements of this division and located within the same zoning district as
the principal use.
   i.   All parking area lighting must be designed, located, and installed
pursuant to
Article VII, Division J of this chapter.  At a minimum such lighting must not
shine directly upon or reflect onto adjacent properties. 
Sec. 10-352.   Retroactive Compliance Not Required
In cases where the minimum required off-street parking for legally established
land uses and building occupancy is not provided at the effective date of this
code, such uses will not be required to meet the minimum parking requirements
of this code until required to do so under
Article III, Division F, (Non-Conforming Use Regulations).
Sec. 10-353.   Access to Adjacent Parking Areas
   a.   For safety and emergency situations and to reduce congestion on major
roadways caused by vehicles entering and exiting parking areas, free access
between adjacent parking areas serving a single use or compatible multiple uses
within a single building or complex must be provided regardless of ownership.
   b.   Free access must be provided where there is public access to front and
rear without accessing public streets unless issue of grade.
   c.   Except for single-family and two-family uses, all off-street parking
spaces must be permanently and clearly identified by stripes, buttons, tiles,
curbs, barriers, or other approved methods.  Parking spaces identified by non-
permanent materials, such as paint, must be regularly maintained to ensure
continuous clear identification of the space.
   d.   Compatible uses under separate ownership with public parking lots must
be connected.
Sec. 10-354.   Ownership or Control
The land on which off-street parking spaces or a loading facility is located
must be owned or under the control of the same entity which owns or controls
the land on which the principal use is located, or by "joint use agreement" as
defined in Sec.
10-359 of the off-street parking and loading requirements.
Sec. 10-355.   Proper Use of Required Parking Space
   a.   Parking spaces and loading areas provided in accordance with this
division may not be used for the sale, repair, assembly or disassembly, storage
or servicing, of vehicles or equipment.  Unlicensed and inoperable vehicles may
not be stored in any required parking or loading space.
   b.   Required parking spaces must be available for the parking of operable
passenger vehicles, by residents, customers, patrons and employees only, and
must not be used for display or storage of vehicles or materials, or parking of
service or delivery trucks and trailers.
   c.   Temporary display of merchandise in a required parking space or loading
area, or a temporary use of a parking space or loading area for a use other
than parking and loading, may be permitted under certain circumstances if
authorized by the planning director through issuance of a temporary use permit
(TUP). 
Sec. 10-356.   Parking Plan and Installation Required
   a.   No building permit for new construction or building expansion, or a
certificate of occupancy and compliance for change in occupancy may be issued
by the building official until a parking plan has been reviewed and approved by
the traffic engineer as a part of the building and site plan review process. 
No certificate of occupancy and compliance may be issued until all off-street
parking and loading facilities have been constructed.
   b.   Parking Plan Requirements
      The applicant for a building permit for new construction or building
expansion, or for a certificate of occupancy and compliance for a change in
occupancy of an existing structure must submit a parking plan showing the
number, location, and size of all parking spaces, driveway dimensions and
locations, traffic aisle widths and locations, and maneuvering areas.  The
applicant must submit information necessary to verify compliance with this
division and the city parking design standards.
   c.   Plans for Paving of Parking Area
      Plans for paving of all off-street parking areas, traffic aisles, and
access driveways, including detailed drainage plans are subject to review and
approval by the city engineer for compliance with this division and the city
driveway requirements in Sec.
10-380 or on file with the city engineer.
   d.   Building Permit Required
      All new parking lots and additions to existing parking lots require
issuance of a building permit.
Sec. 10-357.   Parking Space Design Requirements
   a.     Each parking space required and provided pursuant to the provisions
of this Article shall be not less than nine (9) feet in width and eighteen (18)
feet in length and parking access aisles must be at least 25 feet wide.
   b.     The use of continuous curbing in lieu of individual wheel stops is
allowed.  This will allow sixteen (16) feet of asphalt, and a two-foot car
bumper overhang.  The two-foot car bumper overhang shall be in addition to the
required landscape area, required buffer area or to a sidewalk.

(Ord. No. 0-2009-19; 3/11/09)
 
Sec. 10-358.   Angled Parking
The minimum size of angled parking spaces varies depending on the degree at
which it is angled and the width of the drive aisle.
Angled parking stall size and length dimensions
 
Parking   Minimum Stall Minimum Stall  Minimum Aisle

*Stall is parallel to curb.
**A 26’ drive aisle width is required for all lanes with fire hydrants.
Sec. 10-359.   Joint Use Parking Agreement
The required off-street parking spaces for any number of separate uses may be
combined in a joint parking facility under the following conditions:
   a.   In the case of mixed or joint uses, the parking spaces required must
equal the sum of the requirement of the various uses computed separately.
   b.   A document must be filed with the city showing that the operating
schedules of the facilities involved do not conflict and the separate
facilities will be required to provide enough additional parking spaces to meet
the requirements of this code.
Sec. 10-360.   Off-Street Parking Requirements
The minimum requirement for the number of off-street parking spaces required
for every land use and building occupancy must be calculated by using parking
requirements table in this division.  Parking standards in this division have
been grouped by use and in some instances by occupancy. Where a specific use is
not listed by name on this table, the base standard for its use group will
govern.
Off-street parking spaces must be provided by all uses in the amount specified
in the parking plan.  For most groups, the parking requirement is based on the
square footage of the building occupied by the use.  The gross floor area of
the building is the measurement to be used in determining the square footage of
a building for the purposes of calculating the parking requirement.
   a.   Where the calculation of the off-street parking requirement results in
requiring a fractional space, any fraction less than 0.5 will be disregarded;
any fraction of 0.5 or greater will require an additional space.
   b.   A minimum of four off-street parking spaces must be provided for any
non-residential use except that of home occupations.

Sec. 10-361.   Off-Site Parking Allowance
   a.   Location
      1.   If off-street parking spaces required by this code cannot be
reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is located,
parking spaces may be provided elsewhere if approved by the planning director.
In any case, all required parking spaces must be within 1,000 feet of the
principal use served.
      2.   The 1,000 foot maximum distance is to be measured from the nearest
point of the lot or tract which is the location of the off-site parking spaces,
to the nearest point of the lot or tract which is the location of the principal
use. (Ord. No.0-2013-16; 2/27/13)
   b.   Off-Site Parking Arrangements 
      Off-site parking will normally not be approved by the planning director
for commercial purposes except under circumstances of hardship.  No off-site
parking may be located on the same lot as a residential dwelling. All requests
for approval of an off-site parking arrangement must be submitted in writing
and must include the following:
      1.   A written statement by the owner(s) of the entire land area to be
included within the parking plan, and by the owner(s) of all structures on the
land, agreeing to all of the provisions of the plan.
      2.   Sufficient evidence to establish to the satisfaction of the planning
director that those individuals requesting approval are the owners of the
designated land and structures.
      3.   The location and size of the principal use(s) or structure(s) for
which off- site, off-street parking is required.
      4.   A detailed sketch plan indicating pedestrian circulation routes
between the principal use and the off-site parking lot or area that shows
existing and proposed improvements to sidewalks, crosswalks, crossing signals,
and pedestrian and vehicular access points at the off-site parking location.
      5.   The location and layout of the required off-street parking spaces
and their relative location and distance from the principal use served.
      6.   A permanent and irrevocable easement, unless revocation approved by
the city, covering the off-site parking spaces in favor of the principal use to
be benefited thereby, must be dedicated and recorded as a condition of
approval.
   c.   Review, Approval, and Amendment
      1.   The planning director will consider such requests and either approve
or disapprove the off-site parking plan.  Plan approval may establish necessary
conditions and limitations.
      2.   All off-site parking plans which have been approved by the planning
director will be binding upon the owner(s) of the land and structures included
in the plan, and their successors, and will control all permits and
certificates, and the use and occupancy of the designated land area and
structures. 
      3.   Off-site parking plans may be amended or withdrawn through the same
approval process.  The easement which conveys the right to use the off-site
parking may be revoked only if both parties and the city agree that the need
for the off-site parking no longer exists or that another source of off-street
parking has been secured by the principal use.

compliance parking plan allowing shared parking arrangements for nonresidential
uses with different hours of operation.
      2.   The Planning Director  may permit up to 100 percent of the parking
required for one use to be supplied by the off-street parking spaces provided
for another use if the Planning Director  determines that the various
activities will have peak parking demands at different periods of the day or
week.
      3.   In order to approve an alternative compliance parking plan for
shared parking, the Planning Director must find, based on competent evidence
provided by the applicant, that that there is no substantial conflict in the

Sec. 10-404.   Sign Measurements
The following principles will control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
   a.   Computation of Area of Single-Faced Signs
      The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or
other sign with only one face) will be computed as the area of the smallest
square, circle, rectangle, or triangle in a horizontal plane that will
encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other
display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the
background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop
or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting
framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall
otherwise meets the requirements of this code and is clearly incidental to the
display itself.

IMAGES/0-0-0-80582.jpg]
 
   b.   Computation of Area of Multi-Faced Signs
      The sign area for a sign with more than one face will be computed by
adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two
identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are
substantially similar, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign
structure the sign area will be computed by the measurement of one of the
faces.
   c.   Computation of Height
      The height of a sign will be computed as the mean distance from the base
(s) of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of
the sign. Normal grade will be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade
prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction,
exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the
purpose of locating the sign.

IMAGES/0-0-0-80584.jpg]
 
   d.   Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area
      The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs must be computed by
applying the zoning district formulae contained in sections 10-408 and 10-409
for maximum area per sign, to the lot frontage, building frontage, or wall
area, as appropriate. Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed to
calculate both street frontages into the allowable allocation to be identified
by the master signage plan.
   e.   Computation of Maximum Number of Signs
      Pursuant to the tables in sections 10-408 and 10-409 each lot is
allocated the maximum number of signs allowed per district.  Where indicated,
additional signs beyond the identified allowance will be determined by the
linear frontage of the lot. (Ord. No. 0-2010-119; 11/10/10)
Sec. 10-405.   Sign Lighting
   a.   Illumination of all outdoor signs and advertising of permanent or
temporary duration, must be accomplished by means of indirect light.
Illumination of any type may not be animated, chasing, or flashing. 
   b.   When any sign is illuminated, the light(s) must be properly installed,
shaded, or concealed, so that the light emitted will illuminate the sign face
and will not interfere with the vision of motorists nor shine directly onto
residentially zoned property or abutting residential uses.
Sec. 10-406.   Sign Construction and Maintenance Standards
All signs must be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the
following standards:
   a.   All signs must comply with applicable provisions of the Tyler City Code
at all times.
   b.   Except for banners, flags, temporary signs, and window signs conforming
in all respects with the requirements of this code, all signs must be
constructed of durable materials and must be permanently attached to the
ground, a building, or another structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall,
frame, or structure.
   c.   All signs must be maintained in good structural condition, in
compliance with all building and electrical codes, and in conformance with this
code, at all times.
   d.   All signs must maintain a minimum clearance from electric power lines
of ten feet horizontally and 15 feet vertically, or as may otherwise be
required by the utility provider.  Any relocation of power lines to provide
this clearance will be at the expense of the sign owner or as otherwise
required by the electrical utility.
   e.   Any spotlights allowed to illuminate signs or sign illumination must be
shielded such that their light source cannot be seen from abutting roads or
properties.
Sec. 10-407.   Abandoned Signs
   a.   The city may consider a sign abandoned and cancel the permit or refuse
to renew the permit if:
      1.   a structure is without advertising matter or displays obsolete
advertising matter for a period of 365 consecutive days;
      2.   in the opinion of the building official the sign has fallen into
disrepair, become dilapidated, faded to the point of being illegible, or become
overgrown by trees or other vegetation; or
      3.   the permit renewal fees have not been paid in accordance with this
subchapter, after demand by the department.
   b.   The payment of property taxes or retention of the sign as a balance
sheet asset will not be considered in determining whether the sign permit
should be canceled.
   c.   A nonconforming sign may not be replaced or rehabilitated without being
brought into conformance with the requirements of this section.
   d.   A sign that has been determined to be abandoned by a building official
or code enforcement officer but is otherwise in conformance with this section
may be replaced or rehabilitated in adherence to the requirements of this
section.
   e.   Signs eligible for an historic sign designation are not subject to this
section. (Ord. No. 0-2010-119; 11/10/10)

Sec. 10-410.   Master Signage Plans
   A master signage plan is an administrative permit which establishes
standards (size, design, location, etc.) for all exterior signs associated with
a multi-tenant/multi-building development with two or more tenants, whether on
a single lot or multiple lots. The sign standards of the code provide clear
regulations for the permitting, design, location, construction, modification,
use, maintenance, and removal of signs in the City of Tyler.
   a.   Applicability
      A master signage plan is required for all multiple-tenant buildings,
planned district developments and all multi-building or multi-occupant
commercial developments.
   b.   General Requirements
      1.   The lot or lots involved must be contiguous constitute a single
cohesive development.
      2.   The sign or signs must be located on a lot that one of the
advertised businesses occupies. Alternately the property owner may secure an
easement, and provide written evidence of such, from the owner or entity
responsible for an adjacent property where a sign may be placed.
      3.   The sign must be designed in the overall architectural style of the
buildings within the development.
      4.   The signs may be any sign type that is otherwise allowed by this
code.
      5.   Private streets within the boundaries of the development are treated
as public rights- of-way for purposes of determining allowable signage.
      6.   Individual pad or lease sites, defined in an approved site plan, are
treated as separate lots for purposes of determining allowable signage;
however, it is intended that a business will not be allowed advertising on both
the multiple tenant (shared) sign and another free-standing business
identification sign.
      7.   In addition to signage that would otherwise be allowed on a lot for
business identification purposes, one additional monument sign not exceeding
eight feet in height and 32 square feet in area may be located at each
intersection of public roadways and/or private roadways for purposes of
directing traffic to various areas and businesses within the development.
      8.   All other provisions of this code will be applicable to this sign
category, including but not limited to, allowed number based on road frontage
(multiple lot developments are treated as a single lot for this purpose),
allowable size as a function of zoning district, spacing, illumination,
materials, etc.
      9.   A wall sign displaying the name of a shopping center may be allowed
for developments with less than 2,000 square feet in façade area as long as the
proposed principal sign and tenants' signs do not exceed the maximum areas
which all tenants with direct outdoor entrance or storefront could have
individually.  (Ord. No. 0-2012-83; 10/10/12)
   c.   Application Submittal Requirements
      1.   Master Application Form 
      2.   $80 Filing Fee
      3.   The applicant shall provide two paper copies and one digital copy of
the proposed site plan consistent with the information from the Site
Development Plan Check List.
   d.   Review Process
      A master sign plan is an administrative permit issued by the planning
director. The processing of a master sign plan will involve the following
steps:
      1.   Formal application
      2.   Review for completeness of application
      3.   Staff review
      4.   Final action
   e.   Signs Subject to the Master Sign Plan
      Any sign for which a permit is required and that is part of a development
for which a master sign plan has been approved must demonstrate at the time of
application that such signs conform to the master sign plan. 
   f.   Appeal
      1.   Per
Article VIII, Division G of this code, an appeal of an administrative decision
such as a master sign plan) may be filed by any person aggrieved by the
administrative decision; and any officer, department, board or bureau of the
city affected by the decision. The appeal is filed with the planning department
and must specifically set forth all grounds for the appeal.
      2.   An appeal of an administrative decision must be made within 30 days
after the date of the decision. Such decision will become final following
expiration of the 30-day period if no appeal is filed.
      3.   The appeal authority for administrative decisions is the zoning
board of adjustment.
(Ord. No. 0-2011-45, 6/8/11)
Sec. 10-411.   Flags
Flags and flag poles are considered signs and are therefore subject to these
regulations:
   a.   Flag poles erected in the city are limited to a maximum height of 35
feet, measured from the highest point of the pole to the ground level. 
Individual flag size is restricted to 24 square feet in area.  A Flag and its

   b.   A maximum of three flags or a maximum of three flagpoles with one flag
on each flagpole may be located on a property.
   c.   Portable signs, advertising flags, excluding those permitted above,
pennants, and other attraction gathering devices are prohibited within all
zoning districts, except those allowed by the planning director through the
issuance of a temporary use permit.
   d.   In all zoned districts, signs may not be located so as to cause a
threat to the public health, safety, or welfare.
   e.    Allowed flags include a symbol of a nation, state, political

Sec. 10-412.   Window Signs
Window signs are permitted. The total area of all window signs on any given
elevation of a building may not exceed 25 percent of the window area of that
elevation.
Sec. 10-413.   Freestanding Joint Use Signs
   a.   Sign Pooling
      A freestanding, joint use sign may be permitted to serve two or more
tracts, each of which would otherwise be eligible for one freestanding sign. 
The joint use permit may authorize a larger area of a single sign utilized by
all tracts than would be permitted for individual freestanding signs serving
each tract.  The total square footage of informational area may not exceed 80
percent of the cumulative area which could be permitted for the individual
tracts served by the joint use sign.  A joint use sign permit may only be
granted in lieu of permits for individual freestanding signs.  The total square
footage in the informational area for a joint use sign may not exceed 300
square feet.
   b.   Joint Use Sign Permits
      1.   Before authorization of any joint use sign permit, the request
therefore will be referred to the planning director for study and
recommendation by staff concerning the effect of the proposed use on the
character and development of the adjacent land uses.  The planning director
will decide whether to approve or deny the request.
      2.   The following information must accompany all joint use sign permit
applications:
         (a)   A joint use agreement signed and acknowledged by each
participating tract owner.
         (b)   The joint use agreement must specify the rights of each owner to
use the joint use sign(s).
         (c)   The joint use agreement must stipulate that the rights to use
the sign through each party to the agreement be set forth and the rights run
with the land to the full benefit of the successors of the parties.
         (d)   A detailed site plan showing location, size, and architectural
elevation of all proposed freestanding signs.
         (e)   A legal description of the area served by the joint use permit
and sign and of each individual tract.
Sec. 10-414.   Awning Signs
   a.   The copy/artwork on an awning must not exceed the area and size that is
allowed for a wall sign on the wall to which it is attached. However, the total
area of wall signs and awning signs on any wall must not exceed the area and
size allowed for a single wall sign and must not extend more than 75 percent of
the length of the awning.
   b.   All awnings and canopies have the potential to be signs and are
therefore subject to Sign Construction and Maintenance Standards set forth in
Section 10-406. 
   c. The entire length and height of backlit awnings in which the lighting
causes the illumination of the awning, of which the length will be limited to
75 percent of the façade of the building, will be counted toward the allowed
square footage of the attached sign. (Ord. No. 0-2009-70, 6/10/09) (Ord. No. 0-
2013-77; 8/28/13)
Sec. 10-415.   Electronic Message Center Signs
   a.   In addition to the standards set forth in Table, all electronic message

requirements:
      1.   EMCs must meet all the requirements of this sign code. All EMC signs
shall comply with the appropriate City sign and other regulations.
      2.   The maximum height of any freestanding EMC that is not attached to
or part of a multi-part freestanding sign is eight feet. Where an EMC is
attached to or part of a multi-part freestanding sign, the maximum sign height
will be determined according to the maximum permissible height of the sign type
of which the EMC is a part.
      3.   The maximum area of an EMC sign shall not exceed sixty-four (64)
square feet, and is in addition to other sign allowances.  As an EMC sign is a
form of reader board, the EMC sign square footage may not be coupled with any
other form of reader board.
      4.   Minimum separation between EMC signs is 70’, unless approved by the
Planning Director based on visibility needs.
      5.   EMCs may be used for all or part of an on-premise sign that displays

building and DBAC district in general.
      (b) Sign includes time dedicated to promoting downtown Tyler.
      (c) Sign meets the intent to restore and rehabilitate historically used
marquees.
      (d) Sign color scheme promotes downtown sense of place.

or intersecting traffic, or to be likely to cause a driver to beunduly
distracted in any way.
      3.   Billboards may not be located within 1,500 feet of any public park,
public forest, public playground or scenic area, designated as such by the city
or any other governmental agency.

      1.   The sign area of a billboard must be calculated as the area enclosed
within the outer edge of the frame (border) of each sign face, multiplied by
the number of faces.
      2.   The maximum area for any one billboard must not exceed 672 square
feet.
      3.   Billboard panels may not be stacked, or placed side by side.
      4.   Billboards may have an interior angle with a maximum 15 foot

are properly installed, shaded or concealed, and are aimed so that the light
will project onto the sign face and will not interfere with the vision of motor

address all requirements set forth in this section. 
   3.     Credits are transferable.

laws when erected.
   5.     To be awarded a credit under the incentive program, a sign owner or
designee must notify the City within 60 days of the removal of a billboard and
receive a letter issued by the City awarding a credit. Failure to apply for a
credit within 60 days from removal of a sign bars the awarding of credit for
that sign. Any unused credits will be held in reserve indefinitely, in order to
give incentive for immediate removal of current faces. (Ord. No. 0-2009-70; 6/

DIVISION A.
Drainage and Water Utility Improvements
Sec. 10-470.    Purpose
The purpose of this division is to ensure that the drainage facility needs
caused by the development or use of a piece of property are identified and
provided for in appropriate stages of development.  The objective of drainage
planning and facilities is to protect the uses of the platted property and
safety of citizens who use the platted property in the future and to prevent
development and usage of the platted property from adversely affecting others. 
Sec. 10-471.   Design of Facilities
Design of storm sewer systems, materials, and construction must be in
accordance with the Design Guidelines for Subdivision Improvements. When a
project is determined to be in the jurisdictional control of the U. S. Corp of
Engineers, in regard to the Federal Clean Water Act or successor, the city
requirements for drainage improvements will be subordinate to the requirements
of a Section 404 Permit of the Federal Clean Water Act, or successor. During
the platting process, the flood hazard areas shall be identified and drainage
easements dedicated to the public on the final plat.  Plans shall be submitted
with the plat.  The owners and developers of property have the duty to:
   a.   Accommodate Upstream and Adjacent Drainage Areas
      A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough
to accommodate potential runoff from ultimate development conditions from its
entire upstream drainage area, whether inside, outside, along or adjacent to
the subdivision or addition.  The owner's engineer shall initially determine
the necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction
standards and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed
development permitted by the development code, subject to approval by the
development services engineer.
   b.   Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas
      The owner's engineer shall study the affect of each addition's storm
runoff on the existing drainage facilities at a reasonable distance downstream
of the addition as determined by the development services engineer. Where it is
determined that existing capacity is not available immediately downstream, the
owner's engineer must design a drainage system, detention facility, or parallel
system to mitigate the deficiency.  The commission may deny the plat until the
construction plans for such mitigation has been approved by the development
services engineer.  If oversize improvements are required, then the city may
participate in the cost as prescribed by this code.
Sec. 10-472.   Requirements by Size of Drainage Area
   a.   Less than 1/2 Square Mile
      Developments in drainage areas having a contributing watershed less than
1/2 square mile shall be provided for in accordance with the Design Guidelines
for Subdivision Improvements.  Water conveyances must consist of pipe culverts,
box culverts placed underground, or improved open channels.  An improved open
channel is one in which the channel bottom sides are lined with reinforced
Portland cement concrete or other structurally sound material approved by the
development services engineer to the depth that will convey the 100-year
frequency flood. 
   b.   Greater than ½ Square Mile and Less than 1 Square Mile
      Developments in drainage areas having a contributing watershed greater
than 1/2 square mile and less than one square mile shall be provided for by one
of the following methods:
      1.   Drainage improvements may be provided for in accordance with the
Design Guidelines for Subdivision Improvements.  Water conveyances shall
consist of pipe culverts, box culverts placed underground, or improved open
channels.  An improved open channel is one in which the channel bottom sides
are lined with reinforced Portland cement concrete or other structurally sound
material approved by the development services engineer to the depth that will
convey the 100-year frequency flood.
      2.   When the floodplain is part of an overall master plan of the
development or the Tyler 1st Comprehensive Plan, the development services
engineer may allow the floodplain to be left in a natural state or greenbelt. 
The greenbelt is required to be dedicated to the city in accordance with the
Tyler 1st Comprehensive Plan or a homeowner’s association for maintenance.  The
minimum dedication is 100 feet on each side of the defined floodplain limits. 
If the dedication is to the city, maintenance by the city shall consist of
removal of dead or fallen trees blocking the drainage.  In general, the
greenbelt area shall be left in a natural state. (Ord. No. 0-2014-33; 4/23/14)
   c.   Greater Than One Square Mile
      Drainage areas having a contributing watershed greater than one square
mile shall be provided for by one of the following methods:
      1.   The stream may be left in its natural state with minor improvements
and no development within its floodplain.  Minor improvements include the
removal of dead trees, discarded debris, and obstructions that would hinder the
conveyance of water.  In zones other than RE, R1-A, R1-B, R-2, and PUR zones,
the entire floodplain shall be platted and dedicated to the city as a floodway
easement.  The city will maintain the easement in the same condition as
provided when the easement is within the city limits. In RE, R1-A, R1-B, R-2,
and PUR zones the entire floodplain shall be platted as a separate lot and
dedicated to the city or homeowner’s association for maintenance. The city will
maintain the easement in the same condition as provided when the easement is
within the city limits.  The commission may waive this dedication requirement
only for the following exceptions:
         (a)   Replats which were originally platted prior to the dedication
requirements.
         (b)   Subdivisions of five lots or less.
      2.   The floodplain fringe may be reclaimed for use as long as the
floodway is protected and the 100-year flood elevation is not raised more than
one foot.  This method of development may require erosion control to offset
changes in the stream regimen caused by development of the property and
drainage improvements in accordance with this Article.  In zones other than RE,
R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-2, PXR, PUR, PMF the entire floodway must be platted and
dedicated to the city as a floodway easement.  The city will maintain the
easement in the same condition as provided when the easement is within the city
limits.  In RE, R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-2, PXR, PUR, and PMF zones the entire
floodway shall be platted as a separate lot and dedicated to the city or
homeowner’s association for maintenance. The city will maintain the easement in
the same condition as provided when the easement is within the city limits. 
The commission may waive this dedication requirement only for the following
exceptions:
         (a)   Replats which were originally platted prior to the dedication
requirements.
         (b)   Subdivisions of five lots or less.
      3.   The stream may be reconstructed or relocated to accommodate
development.  The new channel shall be sufficient to convey the 100-year
flood.  The design will include erosion control such as seeding, sodding,
channel lining, or a combination of these.  In zones other than RE, R-1A, R-1B,
R-1C, R-2, PXR, and PUR zones, the entire floodway with proper access easements
must be platted and dedicated to the city as a floodway easement.  The city
will maintain the easement in the same condition as provided when the easement
is within the city limits.  In RE, R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-2, PXR, and PUR zones
the entire floodway and proper access easement shall be platted as a separate
lot and dedicated to the city or homeowner’s association for maintenance. The
city will maintain the easement in the same condition as provided when the
easement is within the city limits.  The commission may waive this dedication
requirement only for the following exceptions:
         (a)   Replats which were originally platted prior to the dedication
requirements.
         (b)   Subdivisions of five lots or less.
(Ord. No. 0-2011-45, 6/8/11)
Sec. 10-473.   Detention Facilities
Lakes, detention ponds, and retention ponds may be constructed in all areas
provided they are approved by the development services engineer.  The city may
assume maintenance responsibilities for this type of facility only if title to
the facility passes to the city, if approved by the council; however, easements
shall be provided to ensure protection of these areas for maintenance purposes.
Sec. 10-474.   Alternate Facilities
Other innovative drainage concepts will be considered if approved by the
development services engineer.  Any city costs are subject to approval by the
city council.
Sec. 10-475.   Access and Dedication of Drainage Easements
   a.   Access to Floodway Easements
      The developer must provide sufficient access on each side of and parallel
to creeks or drainage ways for maintenance purposes.  The access shall be above
the base flood elevation and accessible to vehicles and equipment.  Access must
also be provided at a maximum 1,200 foot spacing along streets or alleys.  The
location and size of the floodway easement shall be determined by the
development services engineer.  The width of the access easement shall be 20
feet.  Permanent monuments, the type and location of which to be determined by
the development services engineer, shall be placed along the boundaries of the
maintenance and access easement and private property.  This access easement
shall be included in the dedication requirements of this division and included
in the drainage and floodway easement width.
   b.   Drainage Easements
      Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the
inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way, perpetual,
unobstructed easements must be provided.  The minimum width of the easements
must be 12 feet in R-1B zoning and 15 feet in RE and R-1A zones.  Depending on
depth and size of drainage facility, the development services engineer may
require wider easements.  Easements must be indicated on the plat.  Drainage
easements must extend from the street to a natural watercourse or to other
drainage facilities.  When a proposed drainage system will carry water across
private land outside the subdivision or addition, when not a natural drainage
course, appropriate drainage easements must be secured. (Ord. No. 0-2011-45, 6/
8/11)
Sec. 10-476.   Sewage Facilities
   a.   Adequate Sewage Facilities
      Sanitary sewer facilities serving the subdivision or addition shall
connect with the city's sanitary sewer system or state approved utility system,
and shall conform to the city's master sewer plan for sewage treatment and
collection.  Sewers shall be installed to serve each lot and to grades and
sizes according to specifications herein identified or referenced.
   b.   Design and Construction Requirements
      Design of sanitary sewers shall be in accordance with the City's Design
Guidelines for Subdivision Improvements and 30 T.A.C. 317, or successor. 
Materials and construction shall conform to the Standard Specifications and
Standard Construction Details of the City of Tyler.  The sanitary sewer system
shall conform to the city's sewer studies for the various drainage basins.
   c.   Sewage Locations
      Sanitary sewers must be located within street or alley rights-of-way
unless topography dictates otherwise.  When located in easements on private
property, access must be provided to all manholes.  A manhole must be provided
at each street or alley crossing.  End lines shall be extended to provide
access from street or alley right-of-way when possible.
Sec. 10-477.   Plan Approval
The development services engineer shall be responsible for receiving and
approving construction plans for sewage facilities.
Sec. 10-478 - 489.   Reserved
DIVISION B.
Low Impact Development Alternative
Sec. 10-490.   Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this division is to promote low-impact development (LID)
approach to stormwater management that would minimize the hydrologic impact of
development and redevelopment on storm water quantity and quality using
primarily nonstructural storm water controls in place of conventional
engineering applications. 
Sec. 10-491.   Applicability
Any person or entity that files an application for a rezoning, subdivision plat
approval, or site plan review may opt to apply LID stormwater management
standards to the proposed development.
Sec. 10-492.   Development Incentives and Alternative Standards
      1.   The development incentives and alternative standards listed below
may be used provided the development complies with associated nonstructural
storm water controls, such as stormwater conservation areas and/or structural
storm water controls, such as permeable pavement, grassy swales/buffer strips,
storm water ponds, and bio retention areas. The intent of a storm water
conservation area is to reduce impervious surfaces; to allow natural
infiltration of storm water runoff; to preserve floodplain, wetlands, and other
undisturbed natural areas; and to provide space for other nonstructural or
structural storm water controls. The intent of permeable pavement, grassy
swales/buffer strips, storm water ponds, bio retention areas, and other
structural controls is to provide infiltration, filtration, and pollutant
removal of storm water runoff.
      2.   Developments that propose to use the development incentives and
alternative standards must follow the site development plan review process in
Article VIII, Division E and the plat review process in
Article IX, of this chapter.
      3.   The areas proposed for nonstructural and/or structural storm water
controls must be shown as a stormwater conservation area on any site plan and/
or land study associated with the development and must be designated as a storm
water quality easement on any plat associated with the development. In addition
to the site plan and plat review process, developments shall follow the site-
specific storm water management plan procedures herein.
   a.   Residential Development
Note:  For residential developments that are [10 acres or larger] and in PUR
would have two options of development standards. One option would be the
standard requirements the other option would be the stormwater management
alternative.  The stormwater management option would allow for reduced lot
size, reduced lot depth, reduced front yard setback, and/or increased lot
coverage if a storm water conservation area is provided. Storm water
conservation areas may not be part of required usable open space, but may
contain structural or other nonstructural storm water controls.
   b.   Off-Street Parking and Loading
      The following stormwater management options are available for off-street
parking and loading areas.
      1.   Alternative Pavement Construction
         For most types of development, this code requires that off-street
parking and circulation lanes be constructed of asphalt or concrete. Permeable
pavement and associated drainage system, such as modular porous pavers or
porous concrete may be used.  Only developments that have minimum required
parking of a certain size (e.g., 100 spaces or more) would eligible for this
permeable pavement option. Gravel parking is not an acceptable permeable
pavement and must not be used for parking and/or circulation lanes, except
where allowed in this code.  Developments may utilize alternative pavement
construction for parking in professional installation according to
manufacturer's specifications.  Alternative pavement options must be maintained
according to manufacturer's specifications and must be in compliance with Tyler
City Code Chapter 18, Article II., Weeds and Debris. (Ord. No. 0-2010-119; 11/
10/10)
      2.   Parking Reduction
         Up to ten percent of required off-street parking spaces may be
permanently set aside as a parking reduction subject to the standards of this
division. Only developments that have minimum required parking of 100 spaces or
greater are eligible for this parking reduction option. The area of the parking
reduction shall be set aside as a storm water conservation area. For the
purpose of parking reduction, storm water conservation areas may not be part of
required interior landscape area and/or landscape edge, and may not contain
structural or other nonstructural storm water controls.
      3.   Excess Parking
         For development with 10 or more required parking spaces, the developer
may accommodate any parking spaces in excess of the basic requirement on an
unpaved, permeable surface such as permeable pavement and an associated
drainage system, such as modular porous pavers, Grass-Crete, and porous
concrete.  At the discretion of the planning director, some or all excess
parking may be accommodated on a gravel surface.
         Excess parking may be provided and constructed with asphalt or
concrete pavement if grassy swales/buffer strips are provided to mitigate the
storm water runoff of the impervious surfaces of the excess parking. For the
purpose of excess parking, grassy swales/buffer strips shall be delineated on a
site plan. Grassy swales/buffer strip areas will not be considered part of
required interior landscape area and/or landscape edge.
      4.   Landscaping Requirements
         The landscaping and tree preservation requirements of
Article VI would provide a storm water management option for alternative
placement of interior parking lot landscaping. Up to 50 percent of the required
interior parking lot landscaping for nonresidential and multifamily development
may be placed outside of the paved boundaries of the parking lot to provide
areas for storm water conservation and/or grassy swales/buffer strips,
detention ponds, bio-retention areas, or other structural storm water controls.
The relocation of required landscape areas would not reduce the required number
of trees or other improvements associated with required landscape areas.
Required landscape areas, either within or outside of parking lot boundaries,
may not be part of required usable open space for multifamily development.

Water systems serving the subdivision or addition shall connect with the city's
water supply and distribution system, and shall conform to the city's master
water plan for water supply, treatment, and distribution.  Water facilities
shall be installed to serve adequately each lot and to grades and sized
according to specifications herein contained or referenced.
Sec. 10-501.   Design and Construction Requirements
Design of water systems must be in accordance with the Design Guidelines for
Subdivision Improvements and 30 T.A.C. 290, Subchapter D, “Rules and
Regulations for Public Water Systems,” or successor.  Materials and
construction must conform to the Standard Specifications and Standard
Construction Details of the City of Tyler.  The water system must be in
accordance with the city's master water plan.
Sec. 10-502.   Fire Hydrants
Fire hydrants and valves are required for all subdivisions and additions and
must be located to satisfy the requirements of the fire department.  Fire
hydrants shall be located in accordance with the Design Guidelines for
Subdivision Improvements and 30 T.A.C. 290, Subchapter D, “Rules and
Regulations for Public Water Systems,” or successor and must be approved by the
applicable fire protection unit.  To eliminate future street openings, all
underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants
themselves and all other supply improvements, must be installed before any
final paving of a street shown on the subdivision plat.  Reflective fire
hydrant buttons must be installed in all streets at a point adjacent to fire
hydrants.  The buttons must conform to Water Utilities and Fire Department
specifications.  At corner locations, buttons must be installed in both
streets.

DIVISION D.
Public and Private Utilities
Sec. 10-510.   Easements
   a.   The property owner will be required to furnish all easements and
rights-of-way required to serve the development.  Where reasonable, utilities
should be located within streets or alley rights-of-way.  Notwithstanding the
above, developers may offer easements outside of street and alley rights-of-
way.  All utility facilities existing and proposed throughout the property must
be shown on the preliminary plat.
   b.   Easements shall be provided for both municipal and private utilities
and must be recorded on the final plat or replat.  Municipal easements for
water, sanitary sewer, and storm sewer not in the public right-of-way shall be
as follows:
 
Depth of Utility Line Minimum Width of Easement 1
0-10'                 15'
10-15'                20'
15-20'                25'
>20'                  30' or greater
Notes:

an abbreviated drainage plan is necessary in order to meet the purposes of this
article.  If an abbreviated drainage plan is required, it must be submitted to
and reviewed by the City prior to granting of the grading permit.  Although the
abbreviated drainage plan does not require the seal or signature of a
registered professional engineer, it must be prepared according to the city
format, as shown in the exhibit below. An abbreviated drainage plan will
generally be sufficient for construction of single-family residences on
subdivision lots.  An erosion control plan is required.  An abbreviated
drainage plan is applicable to development sites of less than one acre, and for
all single-family residential lots.

development, excavating, grading, regrading, excavating, landfilling, berming,
paving, diking, clearing, and grubbing, or other earth changes either without a
grading permit required under this article, or contrary to the terms of a
grading permit issued under this article.
   b.   Upon revocation or suspension of a grading permit issued under this
article, it shall be unlawful to continue to conduct any development,
excavating, grading, regrading, landfilling, berming, paving, diking, clearing
and grubbing, or other earth changes without having a valid grading permit in
effect.
   c.   If it is determined that an individual is conducting activities without
a grading permit required under this article, or upon revocation or suspension
of a grading permit, the development services engineer may issue a stop-work
order on all construction activity on the individual’s property which may be
directly or indirectly related to site drainage and which is being performed
pursuant to any permits, licenses, franchises or contracts issued by the city. 
Such stop-work order may order a work stoppage on all construction activity on
buildings or structures and all appurtenances thereto, including building,
electrical, plumbing, mechanical, street work, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, gas
lines, and all utilities.  Notices in writing and orders required by this
division shall be considered effective if served upon the parties concerned
either personally or by certified mail, addressed to the individual,
contracting party, or permittee at the address given on the contract document
or permit application filed with the city.
   d.   In addition to the enforcement and penalties provided for in this
chapter, no certificate of occupancy for buildings or structures may be issued
until the grading and drainage of the site has been constructed in accordance
with the plan required by this division.
   e.   When a grading permit and drainage plan are required prior to issuance
of a building permit, the structure for which the building permit is issued may
not be used, occupied, or receive a certificate of occupancy unless the
facilities as shown on the accepted drainage plan have been completed by the
permit applicant or representative and reviewed and accepted by the city.  Such
acceptance will be made on the basis of certified as-built drawings prepared by
a registered professional engineer.  If the structure is in a designated
special flood hazard area, it may not be used or occupied until an elevation
certificate, properly completed, has been filed with the city.
   f.   Each day that a violation of this article shall continue, or be
permitted to continue, will be deemed a separate offense. (Ord. No. 0-99-19; 2/

DIVISION F.   Control of Post Construction Stormwater Runoff
Sec. 10-537.    General Provisions
   a.    Findings of Fact
      It is hereby determined that:
      1.    Land development projects and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition;
      2.    This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
water-borne pollutants, and Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source
pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater
runoff from development sites.
      3.    Therefore, the City of Tyler establishes this set of water quality
and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable
guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting
local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of
stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other
construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public
interest and will help minimize threats to public health and safety.
   b.   Purpose
The purpose of this ordinance is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This
ordinance seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
      1.   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and
streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
      2.    Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by
stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality
      3.    Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable.
      4.    Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
   c.   Applicability
   This ordinance shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan
applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the City
of Tyler under the specifications of Sec 10-540 of this ordinance. The
ordinance also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the
minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common
plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even
though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take
place at different times on different schedules.
   To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the City of Tyler has
developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development
sites. These standards apply to construction activity disturbing 5,000 or more
square feet of land. The following activities may be exempt from these
stormwater performance criteria:
      1.   Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an
approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or
approved by the Development Services Department or designated agent, as
applicable.
      2.   Additions or modifications to existing single family structures
      3.   Developments that do not disturb more than 5,000 square feet of
land, provided they are not part of a larger common development plan;
      4.   Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by the
City of Tyler.
      5.   Any permit issued or construction activity legally begun on or any
planned development site plan approved before the effective date of this
ordinance. 
   d. Requirements for Nonconforming Developments
      1. Classification of Nonconforming Developments
      Land developed with a building or structure, which is in lawful use at
the effective date of this code, which was in lawful use as of April 23, 2008,
and land, which does not conform to the post construction stormwater runoff
(PCSR) requirements of this code, but is subsequently annexed to the city, will
have non-conforming use status with respect to this code.
      2. Regulation of Nonconforming Developments
         a. The lawful use of a building or other development as described in
subsection 1 above may be continued although such development does not comply
with the PCSR requirements herein. However, voluntary compliance with these
PCSR requirements and enhancement is encouraged.
         b. The repair or restoration of a building or other development to its
prior condition after being damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, wind,
flood, tornado or other accident or weather phenomena, will not require that
such building or other development comply with the PCSR requirements of this
code, provided a building permit for the repair or restoration is obtained
within 12 months of the date the damage occurred.
      3. The expansion of an existing building, or the construction of one or
more additional buildings on the same lot as the existing building, will not
require compliance with the PCSR requirements of this code provided:
         1. That the expansion of the existing building or the construction of
the additional building(s) will not result in the encroachment of any wall
building line into an existing street yard; or
         2. Where the expansion of the existing building or construction of any
additional building(s) will result in the encroachment of a wall building line
into an existing street yard, the gross floor area (GFA) of the addition, or
the total gross floor area of all buildings to be constructed in the street
yard, must not exceed 25 percent of the GFA of the existing building. (Ord. No.
0-98-90, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2002-46, 10/09/02) (Ord. No. 0-2017-69; 8/23/17)
   e.   Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements
      This ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any
other ordinance, rule or regulation, stature, or other provision of law. The
requirements of this ordinance should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards
for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
(Ord. No. 0-2017-69; 8/23/17)
   f.   Development of Stormwater Design Guidelines
The City of Tyler may furnish additional policy, criteria and information
including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the
requirements of this ordinance and may provide such information in the
Subdivision Design Guidelines. This manual will include a list of acceptable
stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and
operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual
may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the local
review authority, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and
local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed
and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be
presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.  (Ord. No. 0-

Sec. 10-539.    Stormwater Management Plan Requirements
   a.   Stormwater Management Plan Required.
      The plans and documentation submitted for a Building Permit or Land
Subdivision Construction Plans shall include the Stormwater Management Plan to
be used on the project. No land owner, land operator, or contractor shall
receive plan approval for a building permit, or a land development permit
required for land disturbance activities without first meeting the requirements
of this ordinance.
   b.   Stormwater Management Plan Requirements
      The stormwater management plan shall be prepared to meet the requirements
of Sec. 10-541 of this ordinance, and the maintenance agreement, if required,
shall be prepared to meet the requirements of Sec. 10-545 of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 0-2011-45; 6/8/11)
Sec. 10-540.   Waivers to Stormwater Management Requirements
   a.   Waivers for Providing Stormwater Management
      1.    Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required
by this ordinance, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement.
Requests to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be
submitted to the City of Tyler for approval. The minimum requirements for
stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of
the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not
likely to impair attainment of the objectives found in Sec. 10-537. b. of this
ordinance.
         (b)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan
that has been approved by the City of Tyler and the implementation of the plan
is required by local ordinance.
         (c)   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site
facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and
adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or
greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a
legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of
the stormwater practice.
         (d)   The City of Tyler finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
         (e)   Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce
(i) the generation of stormwater from the site, (ii) the size and cost of
stormwater storage and (iii) the pollutants generated at the site. These non-
structural practices are explained in detail in the Subdivision Design
Guidelines and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be
determined by the City of Tyler.
      2.       In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the City
of Tyler may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater
management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided.
However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the City of Tyler that the variance will not result in the
following impacts to downstream waterways:
         (a)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
         (b)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         (c)   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation;
         (d)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life,
property.
      3.       Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for
stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum
requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the City of
Tyler. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant
of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These
lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide
permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat,
         (b)   The creation of a stormwater management facility or other
drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private,
that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed
in accordance with the purposes and standards of this ordinance,
         (c)   Monetary contributions (Fee-in-Lieu) to fund stormwater
management activities such as monitoring of stormwater management practices or
funding capital improvement projects.
   b.   Fee in Lieu of Stormwater Management Practices.
   Where the City of Tyler waives all or part of the minimum stormwater
management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of
adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development,
the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the
City of Tyler.
   When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management,
the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee negotiated
with and established by the City of Tyler, and based on the cubic feet of
storage required for stormwater management of the development in question. All
of the monetary contributions shall be credited to the City of Tyler stormwater
utility fund, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any
building permit for the development.
   c.   Dedication of land
In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the
required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the City of
Tyler for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the
applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management
facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the City of
Tyler prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior
to the issuance of the building permit.  (Ord. No. 0-2011-45; 6/8/2011)
Sec. 10-541.   General Performance Criteria for Stormwater Management
   Unless judged by the City of Tyler to be exempt or granted a waiver, the
following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at
all sites:
   a.   Site designs should establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate
stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
   b.    All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall be treated
to the maximum extent practicable by minimum best management practices (BMPs)
before discharging  directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local water body.
Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland
functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the City of
Tyler. In no case shall the impact on functional values be any less than
allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) or the appropriate State Agency
responsible for natural resources.
   c.    Groundwater recharge shall be encouraged, by promoting infiltration
through the use of structural and non-structural methods.
   d.    To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the current stormwater
design manual.
   e.    Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., cold water fisheries, swimming beaches, recharge areas, water supply
reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to
utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
   f.    Certain industrial sites, as defined in the Texas Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (TPDES) general permit, are required to prepare and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of
intent (NOI) under the provisions of the TPDES general permit. The stormwater
pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new
industrial sites.
   g.    Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as “hotspots”, may require the use of
specific structural STPs and pollution prevention practices.
   h.    Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the City of
Tyler to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design
requirements.
   i.    The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the
Subdivision Design Guidelines shall be used for sizing all stormwater
management practices.  (Ord. No. 0-2011-45; 6/8/2011)
Sec. 10-542.   Basic Stormwater Management Design Criteria
   a.   Minimum Best Management Practices
      The Best Management Practices to be included in the Stormwater Management
Plan are shown in Table 10-542 “Post Construction Best Management Practices”.
For each zoning class or land use designation, the minimum number and type of
BMP required for the Stormwater Management Plan is shown.

For stormwater management practices requiring run-off calculations, the designs
will be based on the Subdivision Design Guidelines.
In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control
than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City of
Tylerreserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed
necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
   For site design feasibility, conveyance issues, pretreatment requirements,
treatment/geometry conditions or other design criterion, refer to the
Subdivision Design Guidelines.
   b.   Maintenance Agreements
If used and required by the City, stormwater treatment practices shall have an
enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions
as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements
required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to
perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the
stormwater treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant
specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater
treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land
disturbance activities.
c.   Non-Structural Stormwater Practices
      The use of non-structural stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in
order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. These non-structural
practices are explained in detail in the Subdivision Design Guidelines.  (Ord.
No. 0-2011-45; 6/8/2011)
Sec. 10-543.   Requirements for Stormwater Management Plan Approval
a.   Stormwater Management Plan Required for All Developments
      No Building Permit application or Land Subdivision Construction Plans for
development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater management plan
outlining the Best Management Practices to be used. This plan must be prepared
by an a Professional Engineer licensed to practice in the State of Texas and
must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on-site or off-site and, if
on-site, the general location and type of practices.  (Ord. No. 0-2011-45; 6/8/
11)
Sec. 10-544.   Maintenance and Repair of Stormwater Facilities
   a.   Maintenance Easement
      Prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy for a Building
Permit that has a stormwater management facility as one of the requirements of
the permit, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance
easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land
served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for
access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the City
of Tyler, or their contractor or agent. The agreement shall also provide for
regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility
is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any
other provisions established by this ordinance. The easement agreement shall be
recorded by the City of Tyler in the land records.
   b.   Maintenance Covenants
      Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured
through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by
the City of Tyler and recorded into the land record prior to a Certificate of
Occupancy for a Building Permit. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be
developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper
function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include
plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility
between scheduled cleanouts. The City of Tyler, in lieu of a maintenance
covenant, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management
facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of
this chapter and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by
easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
   c.   Requirements for Maintenance Covenants
      All stormwater management facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an
annual inspection to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure
compliance with the requirements of this ordinance and accomplishment of its
purposes. These needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other debris
from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation
removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance
needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the City of
Tyler, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as
deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management
facility.
   d.   Inspection of Stormwater Facilities
      Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis, including
but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based
upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage
basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other
contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type
associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or
with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to
cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the
NPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting
under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not
limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges,
surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control
facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and
other stormwater treatment practices.
   e.   Right-of-Entry for Inspection
      When any new stormwater management facility is installed on private
property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a
public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or combined sewer, the property
owner shall grant to the City of Tylerthe right to enter the property at
reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This
includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to
believe that a violation of this ordinance is occurring or has occurred, and to
enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a
violation of this ordinance.
   f.   Records of Installation and Maintenance Activities
      Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater
management facility shall make records of the installation and of all
maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least 5 years.
These records shall be made available to the City of Tylerduring inspection of
the facility and at other reasonable times upon request.
   g.   Failure to Maintain Practices
      If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the
maintenance covenant, the City of Tyler, after written notice, may correct a
violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all
necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event
that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or
public health, the City of Tylershall notify the party responsible for
maintenance of the stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of
that notice, the responsible person shall have 15 days to effect maintenance
and repair of the facility in an approved manner. After written notice, the
City of Tylermay assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair
work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the
property.  (Ord. No. 0-2011-45; 6/8/2011)
Sec. 10-545.   Enforcement and Penalties
   a.   Violations
      Any development activity that is commenced or is conducted contrary to
this Ordinance, may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner
provided by law.

DIVISION G.
Floodplain Regulations
Sec. 10-550.   Statutory Authorization
The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act,
Texas Water Code, Section 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
Therefore, the City Council of City of Tyler, Texas does ordain as follows:
Sec. 10-551.   Findings of Fact
   a.   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
   b.   These flood losses are created by cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the
occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to
other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage. (Ord. No. 0-98-91, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2015-67;
6/24/15)
Sec. 10-552.   Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this Division to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas by provisions designed to:
   a.   Protect human life and health;
   b.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;
   c.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the public;
   d.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   e.   Minimize negative impact to public streets, storm sewer systems and
drainage ways;
   f.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   g.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas so as to minimize future flood blight areas;
and
   h.   Insure that information is available to potential buyers concerning
property in a designated flood area. (Ord. No. 0-98-91, 11/18/98)(Ord. No. 0-
2015-67; 6/24/15)
Sec. 10-553.  Methods of Reducing Flood Losses
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Division uses the following methods:
   a.     Restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   b.   Requires that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   c.   Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   d.   Controls filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   e.   Prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. No. 0-98-91, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2015-67; 6/24/15)
Sec. 10-554.   Definitions

Sec. 10-561.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this Division is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On occasions, greater floods can and will occur, and flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Division does not
imply that land outside the areas of special hazards or uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Division shall not

agencies (including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,
33 U.S.C. 1344), or successor statutes, from which prior approval is required.
   e.   Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), the Floodplain Administrator shall make the necessary
interpretation based on information supplied by applicant.
   f.   Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating agency, currently the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) or successor, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submitting evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   g.   Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated
portion of any watercourse is maintained.
   h.   When base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Sec. 10-556 the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available
from a Federal, State or other source in order to administer the provisions of
Secs. 10-566 through 10-572.
   i.   When regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain
Administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and
AE on the City's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one foot at any point within the community.
   j.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12 of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations or successor, a community may approve

Sec. 10-565.   Variance Procedures
   a.   The Construction Board of Adjustment and Appeals (the Board) shall hear
and render judgment of requests for variances from the requirements of this
division.
   b.   The board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
Division.
   c.   Any person(s) aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such
decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
   d.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
   e.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this Division.
   f.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot on one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in Sec. 10-564.b. have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
   g.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
Division, the board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance as set forth in
Sec.10-552.
   h.   Variances may not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   i.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure. Also, any repair or rehabilitation to a structure that
has been designated as a Tyler Historic Landmark must comply with any
applicable Certificate of Appropriateness or other applicable requirements in
the historic preservation regulations in Article XI. of this Code.
   j.   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      1.   Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      2.   Variances may only be issued upon (i) showing a good and sufficient
cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing ordinances.
3.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      3.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   k.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use, provided that:
      1.   the criteria outlined in Sec. 10-565.a. through k. are met; and
      2.   the structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety. (Ord. No. 0-98-91, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2015-67; 6/24/15)
Sec. 10-566.   General Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction
In all areas of special flood hazards, the following provisions are required
for all new construction and substantial improvements:
   a.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or
modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
   b.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
   c.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage;
   d.   All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during flooding;
   e.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
   f.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and   g.   On-site waste disposal systems
shall be located to avoid impairment to them or  contamination from them during
flooding. (Ord. No. 0-98-91, 11/18/98)
Sec. 10-567.   Specific Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have been
provided as set forth in sections 10-556, 10-563.h., and 10-566 the following
are required:
   a.   Residential construction
      New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the
base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or land surveyor shall
submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of
this subsection is satisfied and that the standard of this subsection as
proposed in Sec. 10-564.a. is satisfied.
   b.   Nonresidential construction
      New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to one foot above the base flood level or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that
below the base flood level structure is watertight, with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or
review design, specifications, and plans for the construction and shall certify
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with this
subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific
elevation in relation to mean sea level to which such structures are flood
proofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
   c.   Enclosures
      New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas
below the floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to equalize
automatically the hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for
entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either
be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or
exceed the following minimum criteria:
      1.   A minimum of two openings, having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding,
shall be provided.
      2.   The bottoms of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
      3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   d.   Manufactured homes
      1.   All manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A shall be installed
using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of
this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but
are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements
for resisting wind forces.
      2.   Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the City's FIRM on sites (i) outside
of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home
park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a
result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest
floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood
elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      3.   Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with
Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the City's FIRM that are not subject to paragraph
d.1. and d.2. of this section be elevated so that either:
         a)   the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation; or
         b)   the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
   e.   Recreational Vehicles
      1.      Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones
A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
         a)   be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
         b)   be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or   
         c)      meet the permit requirements of Section 10-564.a. and the
elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (d)
of this section.
      2.      A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
(Ord. No. 0-98-91, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2015-67; 6/24/15)
Sec. 10-568.   Standards for Subdivision Proposals
   a.   All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions shall be consistent with Secs. 10-551, 10-552, and 10-553 of this
Division.
   b.   All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the
placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet Floodplain
Development Permit requirements of Secs. 10-557, 10-564, and 10-566 through 10-
573 of this Division.
   c.   Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals
and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions which is greater than 30 lots or three acres, whichever
is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Secs. 10-556 or 10-563.h. of
this Division.
   d.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazards.
   e.   All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as
sewers, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize
or eliminate flood damage. (Ord. No. 0-98-91, 11/18/98)(Ord. No. 0-2015-67; 6/
24/15)
Sec. 10-569.   Floodways
Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in Sec. 10-
556 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and erosion potential, the following shall apply:
   a.     Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification by a
professional registered engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that
encroachments will not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   b.   If paragraph a. above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Secs. 10-566 through 10-569. (Ord. No. 0-98-91, 11/18/
98)
   c.   Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, or successors, the City may
permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result
in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the City first completes
all of the provisions required by Section 65.12 or successor.  (Ord. No. 0-
2015-67; 6/24/15)
Sec. 10-570.    City's Participation in Flood Control
   a.   The City's participation in controlling flooding and erosion within
creeks and drainage courses is hereby established as follows:
      1.   Creek clearing and cleaning: If the City deems a project practical,
economical and in the best interest, the City shall provide the equipment and
labor for clearing, dredging and hauling materials such as brush, trees and
other rubbish and debris from the creek bottom. This will be done at no expense
to the property owners.
      2.   Drainage improvement project initiations:
         (a)   The City, upon petition of a majority of the involved property
owners and approval of the project, may survey, design, and provide for
construction of improvements to the drainage course in accordance with
established City criteria.
         (b)       A work order for construction of improvements may be issued
after completion of arrangements for the financing of this project.
         (c)     Upon agreement by 100 percent of the involved property owners,
completion of the following shall be considered adequate: Execution of
mechanic's lien contracts by all participants to secure payment of the property
owners' share or payment in advance of the property owners' entire share.
         (d)     Upon agreement of less than 100 percent of the property
owners, the City Council may, if it deems the project in the public interest,
proceed to convene a public hearing and establish assessments in accordance
with state law against the property improved by the project.
   b.   Cost Distribution
      1.   Contract jobs. A portion of the costs of said improvements will be
assessed to abutting property owners on the following basis:
         (a)   When the creek is on common lot line:
            1)   Property owners shall be responsible for payment of a maximum
one-third of the cost of improvements abutting the property.
            2)   The City shall be responsible for the cost of the balance of
the contract.
         (b)   When the creek lies across single property:
            1)   If the City determines that said improvements would allow
subdivision of the property into two or more lots, each capable of separate
development, the property owners shall be responsible for payment of a maximum
of two-thirds of the cost of improvements.
            2)   If the City determines that the improvements serve only to
join inaccessible portions to the remainder of the lot, the property owner
shall be responsible for a maximum of one-half of the cost of improvements.
      2.   Project in which work is done by City crews. The following are
examples of methods of allocating participation in drainage improvements which
are constructed in whole or in part by City crews. The following list
illustrates common means of sharing participation which result in cost
distributions very near that expressed in the policy for contract jobs in
subsection b.1(b)(1)  above. It is not intended to preclude other types of
participation where special conditions warrant. The City Council will determine
on a case-by-case basis whether such allocations of cost or effort are
appropriate:
         (a)   The City provides equipment and labor, while the property owner
pays for the concrete necessary to cover the bottom of an improved creek
channel.
         (b)   The property owner pays for and constructs the sidewalls of the
channel, while the City provides labor, equipment and pays for materials to be
placed in the bottom of the channel.
         (c)   The City provides equipment and labor for the installation of
pipe. The cost of the pipe is charged back to the adjacent property owners.
      3.   If the property owner wishes to participate in a project in which
costs are allocated in accordance with subsection b. 1(b)(2) above, the
following apply:
         (a)   The property owner shall make written request to the City
engineer for a study prior to securing materials.
         (b)   Upon approval of the project, the property owner will be
notified as to scheduling of work.
         (c)   Material furnished must be approved by the City Engineer,
delivered to the job site, and the City notified of such delivery before the
date agreed upon for beginning work. In the event of any delay in the receipt
of materials, the City must be notified so that the project may be rescheduled.
Failure to supply materials properly or notify the City may result in the
project being bypassed or deleted altogether.
      4.   Unless other financial arrangements are approved by the City
Council, the property owners' pro rata cost for improvements may be payable to
the City in five  successive annual payments, the first being due upon notice
by the City of acceptance of the work.
      5.   A time differential charge of eight percent annual interest on the
unpaid balance shall be added to any installment contract pursuant to this
Division.
   c.   Easements
No work of any nature shall be performed until written drainage easements,
approved by the Legal Department, are granted to the City. When easements are
provided at no cost, that contribution may offset the assessments described
above.
   d.   Materials and Workmanship
All work shall be in accordance with City plans and specifications.
   e.   Limitations
      1.   It is the intent of this policy to provide relief from flooding,
erosion and health hazards beyond the scope of normal homeowner maintenance to
developed residential properties.
      2.   Nothing in this policy shall be construed as authorizing City
participation in the development of private property for resale or the
improvement of commercial property.
      3.   The City reserves the right to refuse to participate in any project
deemed to be impractical, uneconomical, or otherwise not in the City's best
interest.
      4.   The City reserves the right to establish priorities for rescheduling
work to be done. (Ord. No. 0-98-91, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-2015-67; 6/24/15)
Sec. 10-571    Severability
If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this Division is held to be
invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said
holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this
Division.  (Ord. No. 0-2015-67; 6/24/15)
Sec. 10-572    Penalties for Non Compliance
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this Division
and other applicable regulations.  Any violation of the provisions of this
Division or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including
violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions) is unlawful and shall the subject the violator to a penalty as set
forth in Section 1-4.  Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Tyler
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation. (Ord. No. 0-2015-67; 6/24/15)

timely provision of public utilities, facilities, and services.
Sec. 10-619.   Reconsideration
Should the decision of the planning and zoning commission not be appealed to
the city council, or should the city council fail to pass an ordinance
approving the rezoning, a new application for the same zoning may not again be
considered for six months from the date that it was disapproved or withdrawn.
Any new application for rezoning will be regarded as if the applicant had never
filed a previous application.
Sec. 10-620.   Amendment of Site Development Plans
In the case of a planned district rezoning, after the site development plan has
been approved and the zoning change made, adjustments or rearrangement of
buildings, parking areas, entrances, heights, setbacks, or open spaces

director if the changes conform to the standards established by the site
development plan. (ORD. 0-97-62, 12/10/97)

IMAGES/0-0-0-80595.jpg]
   a.   Applicability; Classification of Subdivisions
      Except as otherwise provided these regulations apply to all subdivisions
of land located within both the city limits and its extraterritorial
jurisdiction. Before any land is platted, the property owner must apply for and
secure approval of the proposed subdivision plat or addition plat in accordance
with the procedures of this division.  Subdivisions are classified as major or
minor, depending on the number of lots proposed and the extent of public
improvements required.
      1.   Minor subdivisions
         A minor subdivision is the creation of four or fewer lots and does not
require the creation of a new street or the extension of municipal facilities. 
A minor subdivision may be approved for residential and non-residential
properties except for plats that require public hearings. Minor plat approval
requires the submission of a final plat as described under Sec.
10-635. (Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19).
      2.   Major subdivisions
         A major subdivision involves the creation of more than four lots, as
well as new streets or the extension of municipal facilities.  Major
subdivisions may be approved for residential and non-residential properties.
   b.   Exceptions
      The following types of subdivision do not require approval by the City.
However, the City may not extend utilities or issue building permits for the
development of any property which has not received final plat approval, except
as otherwise provided by this development code.
      1.   The division of land into parts greater than five acres, where each
part has access and no required public improvement is to be dedicated.
      2.   The creation of a remainder of a tract caused by the platting of a
portion of the tract, provided the remainder is larger than five acres and
subject to the following criteria.
         a.   A valid preliminary plat must be approved for the development.
         b.   The calculation of a remainder area(s) will be determined by the
contiguous amount of unplatted developable land.
         c.   Floodplain areas identified on the preliminary plat are not
required to be included on a final plat and may not be considered part of the
remainder area calculation. In the case a proposed street shown on the
preliminary plat or Master Street Plan is adjacent to or crosses a floodplain
area, the right-of-way for the street must be dedicated in accordance to the
phasing plan on the preliminary plat.
         d.   Any area of land required to be dedicated as Master Street Plan
right-of-way or is proposed to remain undevelopable may not be considered part
of the remainder area calculation.
         e.   In no case shall a final plat exclude land so as to leave a
remainder or portion of a remainder of such size, shape, or location as not to
be developable in accordance with the requirements of the Subdivision
ordinance, Sec. 10-165 pertaining to reserve strips, or any other section of
this ordinance. (Ord. No. 0-2017-100; 11/8/17)
      3.   The creation of a leasehold for agricultural use of the property,
provided that the use does not involve the construction of one or more
buildings to be used as a residence or for any purpose not directly related to
agricultural use of the land or crops or livestock raised thereon.
      4.   The division of property through inheritance, the probate of an
estate, or by a court of law.
   c.   Official Submission Date for Items Requiring Commission and Staff
Approval
      1.   An application will be considered complete and ready for processing
only if it is submitted in the required number and form, includes all required
information, and is accompanied by the required filing fee.
      2.   The official responsible for accepting an application must make a
determination of application completeness within seven working days of the
application filing.
      3.   If an application is determined to be incomplete, the official
responsible must provide paper or electronic notice to the applicant, along
with an explanation of the application's deficiencies. No further processing of
the application will occur until the deficiencies are corrected.  If the
deficiencies are corrected, the application will be placed in the next
available processing cycle for review. If they are not corrected within 10
working days from time of notice of deficiency, the application will be
considered incomplete and returned. (Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19)
      4.   Applications deemed complete will be reviewed by staff and other
review and decision-making bodies in accordance with all review and approval
procedures of this development code.
   d.   Approval Criteria
      Applications for plat approval will be evaluated for compliance with
these regulations.
   e.   Minor Plats
      Pursuant to Chapter 212 of the Texas Local Government Code, or successor,
the Planning Director is hereby authorized to approve minor plats.  The
Director may, for any reason, elect to present a minor plat to the Planning and
Zoning Commission for approval.  The Director may not disapprove a minor plat
and must refer any minor plat refused for approval to the Commission within 30
days of the official date of application. (Ord. No. 0-2012-38; 4/25/12) (Ord.
No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19)
   f.   Statutory Compliance Procedure
      The Planning Director must place a complete application on the agenda of
a Planning and Zoning Commission meeting that is scheduled within 30 days
following the official submission date. Applications that have corrected
completeness deficiencies are not considered filed until the next available
processing cycle deadline. The Commission must approve or disapprove the
application at the meeting.  If the Commission fails to approve or disapprove
an application within 30 days of the official submission date the application
must be deemed approved in accordance with Section 212.009 (b) of the Texas
Local Government Code. Unless the Commission unconditionally disapproves the
plat application within such period, the City will continue to process the
application for compliance with these regulations. (Ord. No. 0-2015-67, 6/24/
2015) (Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19)
   g.   Extraterritorial Jurisdiction
      Land in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction is subject to platting,
as provided in Chapter 242 of the Texas Local Government Code, or successor.
The approval of a plat within the extraterritorial jurisdiction does not
constitute approval of land use.  Properties incorporated subsequent to
platting are subject to the city's zoning authority. (Ord. No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-
2000)
Sec. 10-631.   Preliminary Plat
   a.   Applicability
      A preliminary plat is required for all major subdivisions prior to the
construction of public improvements except as permitted under subsection b.
herein.  If a preliminary plat is omitted, a final plat must be required in
conformance to Sec.10-635, and contain all information required on the
preliminary plat.
   b.   Exceptions to Preliminary Plat Requirements
      The preliminary plat approval requirement and procedures of this section
are waived if the following criteria are met:
      1.   The subdivision is actually a resubdivision of lots previously
platted and filed of record in Plat Records, Smith County, Texas; or, all
proposed lots of the subdivision abut an existing street of adequate width such
that no additional right-of-way is required. In either case, no construction of
public streets, alleys, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, or water mains is
required within or for extension to the subdivision; and
      2.   The developer first secures written permission from the Planning
Director, at the Director's discretion, to waive the preliminary plat and
proceed directly to the final plat procedure. (Ord. No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-2000)
(Ord. No. 0-2006-19, 2/8/06) (Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19)
   c.   Application Procedure and Requirements
      On forms approved by the city, the applicant must file  one hard copy and
one digital copy in portable document format (pdf) of the proposed preliminary
plat, with the planning department.  The plat must be prepared by or under the
supervision of a licensed professional engineer or surveyor or land planner in
the State of Texas and must bear the signature of the preparer and the date on
each sheet.  The payment of all applicable fees is required at the time of
submission.  (Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19)

Sec. 10-632.   Standards for Approval
No preliminary plat will be approved by the planning and zoning commission or
city council as applicable, unless the following standards have been met:
   a.   Provision for installation and dedication of public improvements has
been shown;
   b.   Plat conforms to applicable zoning and other regulations;
   c.   Plat meets all other requirements of these regulations; and
   d.   Plat conforms generally to the Tyler21 Comprehensive Plan.
Sec. 10-633.   Approval Procedure
After review of the preliminary plat, the report and recommendations of the
planning director concerning the application and the report and any exhibits
submitted at a public meeting, the applicant will be advised of any required
changes or additions.  The planning and zoning commission must approve or
disapprove the preliminary plat.  One copy of the proposed preliminary plat
will be returned to the owner with the date of approval or disapproval and the
reasons therefore accompanying the plat.  If the commission disapproves the
proposed preliminary plat, the applicant may execute an appeal pursuant to
section
10-615.
   a.   Effect of Approval
      Approval of a preliminary plat also authorizes the property owner, upon
fulfillment of all requirements and conditions of approval, to submit an
application for final plat approval.
   b.   Lapse of Preliminary Plat Approval
      The approval of a preliminary plat will be effective for 48 months from
the date of approval by the commission or the council. If a final plat is not
submitted and approved within that period, the preliminary plat approval will
lapse.  (See Sec.
10-634(e). below concerning extensions and reinstatement of approval.)
   c.   Lapse of Preliminary Plats for Phased Project
      For preliminary plats on projects that are phased, or that will be
developed sequentially, the approval of a final plat for a phase of the project
will extend the expiration date for the remaining portion of the original
preliminary plat for a period of 24 months after the date of approval of the
final plat. Approval of each subsequent final plat within 12 months of the date
of approval of the preceding final plat will extend the expiration date for the
portion of the original preliminary plat for which no final plats have been
approved for an additional 24 months from the date of approval of such final
plat.
      1.   Each 24-month extension period for the expiration of the original
preliminary plat runs from the date of the latest final plat approval.
Extension periods are not cumulative.
      2.   If a final plat is not filed and recorded during the 24-month
extension period, the original preliminary plat, together with any unapproved
Final Plat applications or expired final plats, lapse.
Sec. 10-634.   Amendments to Preliminary Plat
   a.   At any time following the approval of a preliminary plat, and before
the lapse of such approval, a property owner may request an amendment.  The
rerouting of streets, addition, or deletion of alleys, or addition or deletion
of more than 10 percent of the approved number of lots will be considered a
major amendment.  The adjustment of street and alley alignments, lengths, and
paving details; the addition or deletion of lots within 10 percent of the
approved number and the adjustment of lot lines will be considered minor
amendments.
   b.   The planning director may approve a minor amendment.  If the director
does not approve the amendment, it will be referred to the planning and zoning
commission under the terms of this division. Major amendments may be approved
by the commission at a public meeting in accordance with the same requirements
for the approval of a preliminary plat.
   c.   Approval
      The commission may approve or disapprove any proposed major amendment and
may make any modifications in the terms and conditions of preliminary plat
approval reasonably related to the proposed amendment.
   d.   Retaining Previous Approval
      If the applicant is unwilling to accept the proposed amendment under the
terms and conditions required by the commission, the applicant may withdraw the
proposed major amendment or appeal the action of the commission to the city
council pursuant to Sec
10-639 of this development code.
   e.   Extension and Reinstatement Procedure
      1.   90 days prior to or following the lapse of approval for a
preliminary plat, the property owner may petition the commission to extend or
reinstate the approval.  Such petition will be considered at a public meeting
of the commission.
      2.   In determining whether to grant such request, the commission must
take into account the reasons for lapse, the ability of the property owner to
comply with any conditions attached to the original approval, and the extent to
which newly adopted subdivision regulations will apply to the plat. The
commission may extend or reinstate the plat or deny the request, in which
instance the property owner must submit a new application for approval.
      3.   The commission may extend or reinstate the approval subject to
additional conditions based upon newly enacted regulations or such as are
necessary to assure compliance with the original conditions of approval. The
commission may extend or reinstate a plat in 2-year increments.

of all inspection fees.  Upon such release, each contractor must maintain one
set of plans, stamped with city release, on the project at all times during
construction.  (Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19)
      3.   Failure to Commence Construction

engineer for meeting current Design Guidelines for Subdivision Improvements. 
Construction means installation of city-maintained public improvements.

must be recorded after final approval and within 10 working days of receipt of
the originals, which must include the owners' signatures, an original tax
certificate, and any applicable guarantees or bonds. One copy of the recorded
final plat, with street addresses assigned, will be forwarded to the property
owner and others as designated by the director. (Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19)
   j.   Effect of Approval
      Approval of a final plat will certify compliance with city regulations
pertaining to the subdivision of land.  An approved and signed final plat will

(Ord. No. 0-2006-19; 2/8/06) (Ord. No. 0-2016-8; 1/27/16)
Sec. 10-636.   Replatting
   a.   Replat Required
      Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein, a property owner who
proposes to replat any portion of an already approved final plat, other than to
amend or vacate the plat, must first obtain approval for the replat under the
same standards and by the same procedures prescribed for the platting of land
by these regulations.  An exemption to right-of-way dedication requirements in
Sec.
10-156 for certain replats is allowed if the requirements of Sec.
10-153(a) or (b) are met.
   b.   Replatting Without Vacating Preceding Plat
      A replat of a final plat or portion of a final plat may be recorded and

replat:
      1.   Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being
replatted;
      2.   Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions
previously incorporated in the final plat.
      3.   Is approved by the planning director, commission, or city council,
as applicable.
      4.   Any replat which adds or deletes lots must include the original lot
boundaries.
      5.   Plats must conform to applicable state law with regard to public
notification requirements in Texas Local Government Code Sections 212.014 and
212.015, or successors. (Ord. No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-2000) (Ord. No. 0-2006-11, 1/
11/06)
      6.   An exemption to the requirements for improvement, widening, and
realignment of existing and proposed streets set forth in Section
10-156(a-c) is allowed if the requirements of Section
10-156 (d) and (e) are met.  (Ord. No. 0-2006-19; 2/8/06).
Sec. 10-637.   Amending Plats
The planning director may, upon petition of the property owner or developer,
approve and issue an amending plat where one or more purposes for amending
plats (as set forth in Texas Local Government Code Section 212.016), or
successor is satisfied.  Such plat amendments do not require notice, hearing,
or approval of other lot owners (Ord. No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-2000).
Sec. 10-638.   Plat Vacation
   a.   By Property Owner
      The property owner of the tract covered by a plat may vacate, upon the
approval of the planning and zoning commission, the plat at any time before any
lot in the plat is sold.  The plat is vacated when a signed, acknowledged
instrument declaring the plat vacated is approved and recorded in the manner
prescribed for the original plat.
   b.   By All Lot Owners
      If lots in the plat have been sold, the plat may be vacated on the
application of all the owners of lots in the plat with approval obtained in the
manner prescribed for the original plat.
   c.   Criteria
      The commission will approve the petition for vacation on such terms and
conditions as are reasonable to protect public health, safety, and welfare.  As
a condition of vacation of the plat, the commission may direct the petitioners
to prepare a revised final plat in accordance with these regulations.
   d.   Effect of Action
      On the execution and recording of the vacating instrument, the vacated
plat will have no effect.  Regardless of the planning and zoning commission’s
action on the petition, the property owner or developer will have no right to a
refund of any monies, fees or charges paid to the city nor to the return of any
property or consideration dedicated or delivered to the City except as may have
previously been agreed to by the commission. (Ord. No. 0-2000-11, 3-1-2000).
Sec. 10-639.   Waivers and Modifications of Subdivision Design/Improvement
Standards
   a.   The City Council may authorize waivers or modifications from the
subdivision design and improvement standards of this development code if they
determine that undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. In
granting a waiver or modification, the City Council  may prescribe any
conditions deemed necessary or desirable to the public health, safety, and
welfare. A waiver or modification of subdivision design and improvement
standards may not be grantedunless there exists a special circumstance or
unique condition affecting the land involved so that strict application of the
provisions of this ordinance would deprive the landowner of a substantial
property right or a reasonable use of the land, and the waiver or modification
would not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare, nor would
be injurious to other property in the area.  (Ord. No. 0-2012-38, 4/25/12)
   b.   Financial hardship alone is not sufficient to show undue hardship.
Therefore, a waiver or modification will not be granted solely because
nonconformance is more profitable to the developer.
   c.   All matters pertaining to the interpretation or enforcement of this
ordinance, including the definition of a word as it relates to this ordinance,
will be referred to the planning director for a decision. The decision of the
director may be appealed to the commission upon written notice by any party.
   d.   Commission decisions, including granting of waivers or modifications,
may be appealed to the city council upon written notice by an applicant, an
affected party, or by the city.  However, any recommendation by the Planning
and Zoning Commission to approve a request to waive or reduce escrow allowed or
required under this ordinance shall be forwarded to  the City Council for final
approval, and the Planning and Zoning Commission shall only have advisory
authority with regard to waiver or reduction of escrow.  The City Council shall
have authority to grant the request for waiver or reduction of escrow, to
modify the request, or to deny such request in its entirety.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-
19; 3/11/09)
   e.   Written notice of appeal must be filed with the office of the planning
director not later than 21 calendar days from the date of subject decision so
that the item may be placed on the agenda for the next available planning and
zoning commission or city council meeting as the case may be and the affected
parties notified of the appeal.
   f.   The planning director or the development services engineer are
authorized to grant a modification to subdivision design and improvement
standards in instances where the requested modification is not visually
detectable and does not exceed 10 percent of the overall dimensional standard
or measurement.
Sec. 10-640.  Pre-plat agreements authorized.
                The Planning Director may waive the requirement that an
application first have property platted before obtaining  a Building Permit. 
In such instance, the Planning Director shall require a Pre-Plat agreement in

            a.    As required by City Code Section 10-140 or successor,
applicant shall be responsible for the entire cost of designing and installing
all public improvements that will primarily serve the subdivision or addition.
            b.    Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the property may be
subject to dedication requirements, and that the applicant may be subject to
the payment of fees, payment of construction costs, and/or associated escrow
payments that are roughly proportionate to the proposed development.
   c.    Upon completion of the construction, remodeling or replacement of
improvements on the property, and upon verification by the Building Inspection
Division of the Development Services Department that all City codes have been
met, including all requirements of City Code Code Chapter 10, and that a legal
plat has been approved by the City of Tyler and recorded with Smith County, a
Certificate of Occupancy to occupy the space shall then be issued by the City.
   d.    No Certificate of Occupancy or final inspection will be issued if an
approved plat is not recorded by completion of the construction, remodeling or
placement of improvements.
   e.    Pre-plat agreements shall be effective for ninety (90) days after the
date of the Agreement, and will not be valid for the issuance of a Building
Permit thereafter.
(Ord. No. 0-2010-20; 3/10/10)
Sec. 10-641.   Administrative plat authorized
   a.   The Planning Department may accept certain minor plats out of the main
plat cycle if  the purpose of the plat is limited to one or more of the
following and does not require a public hearing:
      1.   Add/Correct an error in a course or distance;
      2.   Correct an error in a property description or any other type of
scrivener or clerical error or omission;
      3.    Relocate a lot line to eliminate an inadvertent encroachment of a
building or other improvement on a lot line or easement;
      4.    Relocate or remove one or more lot lines between one or more
adjacent lots;
      5.   Create six or fewer lots in a subdivision under an existing plat.
(Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19)
   b.   The official responsible for accepting an application under this
section must make a determination of application completeness within seven
working days of the application filing.  The applicant must demonstrate at the
time of filing that the application meets administrative approval criteria.
Should a plat not meet the administrative approval criteria, the application
will be returned and the applicant must re-file during the typical Planning and
Zoning Commission review cycle. (Ord. No. 0-2019-87; 10/8/19)
   c.   The approvals by City staff shall be in accordance with Texas Local
Government Code Section 212.016, or successor.  Such plat amendments do not
require notice, hearing, or approval of other lot owners.  (Ord. No. 0-2012-83;
10/12/12)

   b.   A site plan is also required for day care centers, broadcast and
communication towers, and other uses where a special use permit is required.
Sec. 10-651.   Waiver of Site Development Plan Requirement

Sec. 10-652.   Application Requirements
A site development plan must be prepared in accordance with and include all
items noted on the site development plan application and checklist which is
kept on file in the planning department.
Sec. 10-653.   Site Development Plan Approval
   a.   Where the proposed planned district zoning and the site development
plan both comply with the intent and requirements of this code, the planning
and zoning commission may make a recommendation to the city council that an
amendment to this ordinance to establish a zoned district for the land subject
to the plan be approved.  (O-2003-38, 7-23-03)
   b.   Should the city council accept the recommendation of the planning and
zoning commission, then the council may rezone the land covered by the site
development plan.
Sec. 10-654.   Existing Site Conditions
If undeveloped, any use proposed for such properties will be required to adhere
to the approved site development plan.  If the property is developed, any
proposed use will be required to use the existing structures.
Sec. 10-655.   Lapse of Site Development Plan Approval
   a.   A site development plan will be deemed void if the developer fails to
follow the construction time schedule, abandon the plan, or if construction is
terminated after the completion of any phase or at any stage and evidence that
further development is not contemplated.  In such circumstances the planning
director may initiate a rezoning of the property back to the original zoning.
   b.   Should the property for which a site development plan not be rezoned,
any further development of the district property will require the preparation
and submittal of a new site development plan to the planning and zoning
commission where it must be approved development of the property may proceed. 
(O-2003-38, 7-23-03)
Sec. 10-656.   Administrative Approval of Site Plan Modifications
After a site development plan has been approved and the zoning change made,
adjustments or rearrangement of buildings, parking areas, entrances, heights,
setbacks, or open spaces requested in writing by the developers, may be
approved by the planning director if the changes substantially conform to the
standards established by the Site Development Plan. (ORD. 0-97-62, 12/10/97)

Sec. 10-660.   Purpose
Zoning Variances are intended to address unnecessary hardships or practical
difficulties resulting from strict application of zoning-related standards.
Sec. 10-661.   Authority to File
Appeals to the zoning board of adjustment (ZBA) may be made by any person
aggrieved or affected by any decision of the planning department in the
enforcement of this development code. 
Sec. 10-662.   Procedures
   a.   Requests for variances from this ordinance must be submitted in writing
to the zoning board of adjustment.  Such appeal or request must be filed with
the planning department and must specify the grounds thereof.
   b.   Each variance request must be accompanied by payment of the appropriate
fee to be charged by the city for administering the appeal. The fee is non-
refundable, and under no circumstances may the fee (or any portion thereof) be
refunded for failure of such proposed variance to be enacted into law.
   c.   The planning department must transmit to the board all of the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   d.   The board must consider such appeals in the same manner as other
appeals within its jurisdiction.  All cases will always be heard by a minimum
of four members or members and alternates.  The concurring votes of four
members are necessary to reverse any decision of any administrative official,
to decide in favor of the applicant, or to effect any variation to this
development code.
   e.   The zoning board of adjustment may authorize a variance from this
development code when an undue hardship will result from requiring strict
compliance.  The board has the responsibility of making the findings herein
below required, and must take into account the nature of the proposed use of
the land involved, existing uses of land in the vicinity, the number of persons
who will reside or work in the proposed development, and the probable effect of
such variance upon the public health, safety, convenience, and welfare in the
vicinity.
Sec. 10-663.   Review Criteria
   a.   No variance may be granted unless the board finds:
      1.   special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such
that the strict application of the provisions of this development code would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land
      2.   the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation
and enjoyment of a substantial property right and not merely to serve as a
convenience to the applicant.
      3.   a variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
substantial property right of the applicant
      4.   the authorizing of the variance will not impair an adequate supply
of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion
in public streets, or increase the damages of fire or impair the public safety
or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the
surrounding areas, or in any other respect impair the health, safety, comfort,
morals or general welfare of the inhabitants of the City.
      5.   the granting of the application will not be contrary to the plan of
development for the general area.
      6.   in exercising the above-mentioned powers and in determining whether
the required special conditions and hardships are present, the board may
consider the size and shape of the subject property, any and all financial
considerations to the applicant, and any other matters that the board
determines material to the application.
   b.   Such findings of the ZBA together with the specific facts, upon which
the finding is based, must be incorporated into the official minutes of the
meeting at which such variance is granted.  Variances may be granted only when
it is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this development code
so that the public health, safety, and welfare may be secured and substantial
justice done. 
      1.   Monetary hardship to the developer, standing alone, must not be
deemed to constitute undue hardship. (Ord. No. 0-98-90, 11/18/98) (Ord. No. 0-
2002-46, 10/09/02)
Sec. 10-664.   Public Hearing Notices
   a.   Notice Required
      The individual procedures of this division specify the types of public
hearing notice required.
      1.   Newspaper Notice
         When newspaper notice is required, it must be published in a newspaper
of general circulation within Tyler at least 15 days prior to the public
hearing.  Whenever a procedure requires multiple hearings—one before the
planning and zoning commission and one before the city council, for example—a
single notice or separate notices for each hearing may be provided.
      2.   Mailed Notice
         Not less than 15 days before the date set for the public hearing,
mailed notices must be sent by first class U.S. mail to all owners of real
property subject to the action and to all owners of real property situated
within 200 feet of the property on which the proposed action would occur as
recorded on the current Smith County Appraisal District tax roll. The
notification by mail of owners of property in the ETJ whose property is within
200 feet of the proposed action is provided as a courtesy to such owners and
should not be construed as conferring standing to protest such action. 
   b.   Content of Notice
      All public hearing notices must:
      1.   Indicate the date, time, and place of the public hearing or date of
action that is the subject of the notice;
      2.   Describe the property involved in the application by street address
or by general description;
      3.   Describe the general nature, scope, and purpose of the application
or proposal; and
      4.   Indicate where additional information on the matter can be obtained.
      5.   The applicant may submit additional information to the planning
department in support of its application that will be include in whole or in
part in any mailed or published notices.
Sec. 10-665.   Administrative Approval
   a.   Requests for variances from this ordinance that are percent of the
applicable standard may be approved by the planning director.
 
   b.   The planning director may approve variance requests for residential
setbacks from the applicable standard, and such variances are allowed by right
if all of the following conditions are met:
      1. The variance request is intended to correct an encroachment of an
existing structure into a setback yard; and
      2. The variance request is not meant to circumvent development standards;
and
      3. The variance request is consistent with the overall plan of
development of the general area. (Ord. No. 0-2013-41; 5/22/13)

IMAGES/0-0-0-80601.jpg]
 
Sec. 10-670.   Effect of Appeal
The zoning board of adjustment may hear and decide an appeal that alleges error
in an order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official in the enforcement of this code.  In exercising its authority, the
board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the administrative
official’s order, requirement, decision, or determination from which an appeal
is taken and make the correct order, requirement, decision, or determination,
and for that purpose the board has the same authority as the administrative
official.
Sec. 10-671.   Appeal Procedures
   a.   Initiation
      Within 30 days after the date of the administrative decision, appeal of
an administrative decision may be initiated by any person aggrieved by the
administrative decision, or any officer, department, or board of the city
affected by the decision.
   b.   Content of Notice of Appeal
      The notice of appeal must specifically set forth all grounds for appeal.
   c.   Effect of Appeal
      An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is
appealed unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies in writing
to the board the facts supporting the official’s opinion that a stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property.  In that case, the proceedings may be
stayed only by a restraining order granted by the board or a court of record,
after notice to the official and if due cause is shown.
Sec. 10-672.   Review Criteria
The zoning board of adjustment considers whether the planning director or other
administrative official’s action was appropriate considering the details of the
case and the requirements contained in this unified development code. The board
will make its decision based on this unified development code and the
information presented to the Zoning Board of Adjustment by the applicant and
the director or other administrative official.
   a.   Appeal Hearing
      The zoning board of adjustment must set a reasonable time for hearing the
appeal and must give notice to the parties and to the public.  Each appeal must
be heard by at least 75 percent of the members of the board.
   b.   Burden of Proof in Appeals
      When an appeal is taken to the zoning board of adjustment, the director’s
or other administrative official’s action is presumed to be valid. The
applicant must present sufficient evidence and have the burden to justify a
reversal of the action being appealed. The director may present evidence and
argument to the contrary.
   c.   Findings and Conclusions
      All findings and conclusions necessary to the permit or appeal decision
must be based upon reliable evidence.  Competent evidence, that is, evidence
admissible in a court of law is preferred whenever reasonably available. In no
case may findings be based solely upon incompetent evidence unless competent
evidence is not reasonably available, the evidence in question appears to be
particularly reliable, and the matter at issue is not seriously disputed.  In
exercising its authority, the board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part,
or modify the administrative official’s order, requirement, decision, or
determination from which an appeal is taken and make the correct order,
requirement, decision, or determination, and for that purpose the board has the
same authority as the administrative official.
   d.   Decision on Appeal
      The board must review the application, the director’s report, conduct a
hearing in accordance with the board’s established procedures and state law,
and take final action on the application. It must require a concurring vote of
three-fourths vote of all members of the zoning board of adjustment to overturn
an administrative decision.

Landscaping and Tree Preservation
Sec. 10-680.   Procedures
   a.   Appeals to the zoning board of adjustment of any determination
regarding landscaping and tree preservation requirements of
Article VI may be taken by any person aggrieved or affected by any decision of
the planning department in the enforcement of this article.  Requested
variances from this code must be submitted in writing.  Such appeal or request
for a variance must be filed with the planning department, must specify the
grounds thereof, and must be accompanied by a filing fee in an amount
established by the city council and kept on file in the planning department. 
The planning department will transmit to the board all of the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   b.   The board will consider such appeals in the same manner as other
appeals within its jurisdiction.  All cases to be heard by the board will
always be heard by a minimum of four members or members and alternates.  The
concurring votes of four members of the board or members and alternates will be
necessary to reverse any decision of any administrative official, to decide in
favor of the applicant, or to effect any variation to this article.
   c.   The zoning board of adjustment may authorize a variance from this
article when an undue hardship will result from requiring strict compliance. 
The board has the responsibility of making the findings herein below required,
and will take into account the nature of the proposed use of the land involved,
existing uses of land in the vicinity, the number of persons who will reside or
work in the proposed development, and the probable effect of such variance upon
the public health, safety, convenience and welfare in the vicinity.
Sec. 10-681.   Violation, Penalty, and Enforcement
   a.   It is the duty of the city to enforce this code.  Appeals from the
decision of the planning director may be made to the zoning board of
adjustment, as provided by
Article VIII, Division F.  Reports of non-compliance with this code should be
directed to the planning department.  The planning department will accept
complaints from the public.  Upon receipt of a complaint, the zoning inspector
will investigate and, if non-compliance exists, will inform the property owner
of the violation, giving a reasonable amount of time to comply.  Should the
owner fail to comply within the time period, the owner will be subject to a
fine established by the city council and kept on file in the planning
department. Notice will:
      1.   Be in writing;
      2.   Include a statement of the reason for its issue;
      3.   Allow a reasonable time for compliance;
      4.   Be served upon the owner, or agent responsible for property
maintenance provided that such notice or order can be deemed to have been
properly served upon such owner or agent when a copy thereof has been served
with such notice by any method authorized or required by state law; and
      5.   Will contain an outline of remedial action, which, if taken, will
effect compliance with this division.  At the end of such period as noted
above, the Planning Director or designated enforcement officer will re-inspect,
and if such conditions or practices have not been corrected, further legal
action by the city may be instituted. Any person violating any of the
requirements of this division may be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
conviction, may be punished by a fine in an amount established by the city
council and kept on file in the planning department.  (Ord. No. 0-98-90, 11/18/

DIVISION I.  HISTORIC DISTRICT OVERLAY DESIGNATION
Sec. 10-714.    Historic District Overlay.
   a.   Purpose.  A Historic District Overlay is intended to establish and
preserve structures, sites or areas that have outstanding historical and
cultural significance.  It is not intended to limit the development of
undeveloped lands. 
    b.   Designation.  The City Council may designate sites, buildings,
structures, landscapes and objects as historic districts, including the public
rights-of-way in and surrounding such historic districts, by adopting a zoning
district designated as the Historic District Overlay (HD-O) on the City’s
official zoning map pursuant to the procedures set forth herein.  Nothing
contained in the designation of a property as a HD-O shall affect the use of
the property, and all uses shall be governed by the zoning use districts
established by the Unified Development Code.  The City is divided into "Zoning
Districts" which are restricted to residential use; for office, limited
commercial or educational use; for commercial, mixed use or educational,
industrial/manufacturing use.
    c.   Ordinance required.  Each HD-O shall be designated by a separate
ordinance.  Such an ordinance will set forth the boundaries of a HD-O and will
include regulatory standards and guidelines applicable to the district. 
   d.   HD-O Criteria. A HD-O may be established to preserve areas of exemplary
architectural, archaeological, cultural, or historic value provided such areas
are located within an area contained within the Historic Resources Survey, when
such survey conforms to survey guidelines established by the Texas Historical
Commission and the National Park Service, is on file at the City  and meets one
or more of the following characteristics:
                        1.     Significance in history, architecture,
archaeology or culture.
                     2.     Association with certain events that have made a
significant contribution to the broad patterns of local, regional, state or
national history.
                        3.    Association with the lives of significant persons
in the past.
                        4.    Embodies the distinctive characteristics of an
architectural or engineering type, period or method of construction.
                        5.     Represents the work of a master designer,
builder or craftsman.
                        6.     Represents an established and familiar feature
of the community.
A HD-O must consist of an area of at least one block face, with a minimum of
three contiguous properties and with at least three-fourths of the properties
that are at least fifty years old.   Properties not required to meet the 75% or
the block face that do not want to join into the district are not required to
become part of the district.  Commercial zoned property contained within the
district must be at least 75 years old and must be a contributing property or
structure as defined in subsection e below. Vacant properties over two acres
may not be included in a proposed district unless they are contributing
properties.  As it relates to this ordinance, a block face consists of a
minimum of one side of a street between two boundary streets or a dead end (cul
de sac). Once a HD-O is created, adjoining properties may be included by a
separate ordinance, and must complete the required process established in
subsection f.

IMAGES/0-0-0-97309.jpg]
            e.    Guidelines and regulations applicable to HD-O.  Design
guidelines and other appropriate regulations concerning exterior and site
development or redevelopment of the HD-O may be recommended by the Historical
Preservation Board and adopted by the City Council as part of the ordinance
establishing the HD-O. Interior renovations are exempt from all requirements of
the HD-O.  Any regulation for a specific HD-O shall apply to all contributing
properties or structures wholly contained within the HD-O.  As it relates to
this ordinance a contributing property or structure is one that by location,
design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling and association adds to the
district’s sense of time and place and historical development. All new
additions, exterior alterations or related new construction for non-
contributing properties or structures wholly contained within the HD-O must
conform and be contextual as it relates in scale, mass, placement and materials
to the surrounding properties.
Standards for the HD-O shall be as set out in the following Secretary of
Interior Standards for Rehabilitation:
1.   A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that
requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces and
spatial relationships.
2.   The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved.  The
removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces and spatial
relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.
3.   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place
and use.  Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as
adding conjectural features for elements from other historic properties, will
not be undertaken.
4.   Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their
own right will be retained and preserved.  Distinctive materials, features,
finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that
characterize a property will be preserved.
5.   Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. 
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture and,
where possible, materials.  Replacement of missing features will be
substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
6.   Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using
the gentlest means possible.  Treatments that cause damage to historic
materials will not be used.
7.   Material and significant archeological resources will be protected and
preserved in place.  If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures
will be undertaken.
8.   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction will not
destroy historic materials, features and spatial relationships that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old
and will be compatible with historic materials, features, size, scale and
proportion and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment.
9.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken
in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
New construction, in general, shall be compatible with the existing buildings
or structures in the HD-O regarding scale, mass, placement and materials.
Additional guidelines for the HD-O shall be found in the Secretary of Interior
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings.  A copy of such regulations
shall be available in the Planning Department, as well as on the Planning
Department website.
   f.   Authority to designate.  Designation of a HD-O may be accomplished by
ordinance of the City Council if all of the following requirements are met:
      1.   A petition to the Planning and Zoning Department containing the
signatures of at least 75 percent of the property owners located within the
proposed HD-O; and
      2.   A recommendation for approval by the Historical Preservation Board;
and
      
                        3.   Favorable vote of a simple majority of the members
of the City Council.
            g.        Notice requirements.  Notice shall be provided as set
forth in Section 10-586.
   h.   Scope of City Council Review.  In its review of the proposed HD-O the
City Council may:
1.   Revise the proposed regulatory standards or guidelines attached to the
proposed ordinance designating a HD-O; and 
2.   Reduce the boundaries of the HD-O as proposed in the map attached to the
proposed ordinance.
The designation, amendment or retraction of a designation will not become
effective until a map setting forth the boundaries of the HD-O, or change in
the boundaries thereof, has been filed with the Planning and Zoning Department
and as listed on the tax rolls of the Smith County Appraisal District (SCAD).

Sec. 10-720.   Purpose
Special use regulations set standards, conditions, and procedures whereby
special uses may be approved. A use is considered special by this development
code when there is potential for it to have adverse impact on nearby property
and because the actions needed to minimize or eliminate the adverse impacts
vary from site to site. 
Sec. 10-721.   Authority to File
Special use permit applications may be filed only by the owner of the property
on which the special use will be constructed or by the property owner’s
authorized agent.
Sec. 10-722.   Application Procedure
Only uses designated as special uses by this development code are eligible for
consideration.  Such special uses and the zoning districts in which the use is
permitted are shown on the use tables in
Article III of this chapter.
Sec. 10-723.   Application and Processing Requirements
The planning and zoning commission must hold a public hearing on all requests
for a special use permit.  The public hearing will be held at a regular
meeting.  The completed application must include a site plan of the property
which contains all information as required by the site plan guidelines of the
planning department.
Sec. 10-724.   Notice of Hearing
Public notice must be provided in accordance with Sec.
10-586.
Sec. 10-725.   Planning and Zoning Commission Action
   a.   Upon receipt of a completed application for a special use permit
requesting an amendment to this code, the planning department subject to the
appropriate application deadline, will schedule the request for a public
hearing before the planning and zoning commission at its next regularly
scheduled monthly meeting
   b.   The commission will take one of the following actions:
      1.   recommend the application to the city council as submitted;
      2.   recommend the application with modifications;
      3.   table the application for consideration at a later meeting; or
      4.   deny the application.
   c.   Final approval of all special use permits rests with the city council.
   d.   The commission may impose conditions and restrictions upon the special
use under consideration with the intent of minimizing the impact of the on
nearby properties.
   e.   By recommending the special use, the commission thereby recommends
final approval by the city council of an ordinance granting a special use
permit. (O-2003-38, 7-23-03)
Sec. 10-726.   Review Criteria
The planning and zoning commission and city council, in considering each
special use permit (SUP) request, will review the overall compatibility of the
proposed special use with surrounding property as well as such specific items
as screening, parking, and landscaping to make sure that the impact of the
special use is minimal and that little or no adverse effects occur to nearby
property. (O-2003-38, 7-23-03)
Sec. 10-727.   Development Standards and Review Guidelines
At the discretion of the planning and zoning commission the following
development standards and design specifications can or may be the basis for
approval of a special use permit:
   a.   The design, location, and operating plans must be such that the safety

Sec. 10-728.   Conditions
   a.   Term and Duration of Approval
      Special use permits are approved for a specific period of time.  The term
and duration of a special use permit rests with the city council. Most first-
time special use permits are issued for three years.  Renewals of existing
special use permits will be renewed for a longer time period, usually for five
years.  Some special uses, due to their nature and the cost associated with
their operation, may be approved indefinitely.
   b.   Violations
      All conditions required for a special use permit must be met before any
part of the use can be occupied.  Violation of any term, condition,
requirement, or duration of a special use permit approved under this division
is unlawful, and will constitute a violation of this development code, and will
subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Sec.
10-774.  In addition, the special use permit may be revoked or suspended by the
city council due to such violation, following public hearings by both the
planning and zoning commission and the city council.
   c.   Compliance with Conditions
      Compliance with all conditions required for a special use permit must be
completed within one year of the authorization, unless a special time limit has
been imposed by the city council.  An extension of time beyond [one] year, or
that imposed by the council, may be granted by the planning director, one time,
for up 90 days.
   d.   No variance may be granted through issuance of a special use permit,
except for variances granted to the alcohol distance requirements by the City
Council pursuant to Section 10-96.  The planning director may grant minor
changes to the conditions imposed as long as those changes conform to the
intent of the commission. No building permit involving a special use must be
issued by the building official unless all of the requirements of this division
have been met. (Ord. No. 0-2013-41; 5/22/13)
Sec. 10-729.   Appeal of a Special Use Permit
The decision of the planning and zoning commission concerning a special use
permit may be appealed to the city council.  The applicant must file the appeal
with the planning department by the 5:00 p.m. on the 10th calendar day
following the date of decision by the commission.
Sec. 10-730 – 739.   Reserved
DIVISION B.
Temporary Use Permits
The planning department may issue a temporary use permit (TUP) for the uses
defined in
Article III provided that the temporary use complies with regulations of this
ordinance governing area, parking, signage, sanitation requirements, etc., for
the district in which it is to be conducted and does not constitute a nuisance
for adjacent properties. 
Sec. 10-740.   Applicability
   Temporary uses shall comply with the minimum requirements set forth in
Section
10-64.  (Ord. No. 0-2010-20; 3/10/10)
Sec. 10-741.   Review and Approval by the Planning Director
   a.   The director must approve, approve with conditions, or deny the
temporary use permit. 
   b.   The director must review all signs in conjunction with the issuance of
the temporary permit. Such signs must be in accordance with the requirements of
this UDC.
Sec. 10-742.   Review Criteria
In determining whether to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a temporary
use permit, the director will consider the following criteria:
   a.   Land Use Compatibility
      Whether the proposed temporary use:
      1.   is compatible with the purpose and intent of this UDC and the zoning
district in which it is located; 
      2.   does not impair the normal, safe, and effective operation of a
permanent use on the same site; and 
      3.   does not endanger or is not materially detrimental to the public
health, safety, or welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the
immediate vicinity of the temporary use, given the nature of the activity, its
location on the site, and its relationship to parking and access points.
   b.   Compliance with Other Regulations
      The structures and the site meets all applicable building code, zoning
district, and fire code standards and must be promptly removed upon the
cessation of the use or event.  Upon cessation of the event or use, the site
must be returned to its previous condition (including the removal of all trash,
debris, signs, or other evidence of the temporary use).
      1.   Traffic Circulation
         The temporary use does not cause undue traffic congestion or accident
potential given anticipated attendance and the design of adjacent streets,
intersections, and traffic controls.
      2.   Off-Street Parking
         Off-street parking for the temporary use does not eliminate required
parking for any of the other existing uses on the site, thus creating a parking
shortage.
      3.   Public Conveniences and Litter Control
         Adequate on-site rest room facilities and refuse containers will be
provided.  All litter generated by the event or use will be removed at no
expense to the city.
      4.   Appearance and Nuisances
         The temporary use is compatible in intensity, appearance, and
operation with surrounding land uses in the area, and it does not unduly impair
the usefulness, enjoyment, or value of adjacent property due to the generation
of excessive noise, dust, smoke, glare, spillover lighting, or other forms of
environmental or visual pollution.
   c.   Other Criteria
The planning director may establish any additional review criteria deemed
necessary to ensure land use compatibility and to minimize potential adverse
impacts on nearby uses, including, but not limited to, restrictions on hours of
operation, temporary arrangements for parking and traffic circulation,
requirements for screening or buffering and guarantees for site restoration and
cleanup following the temporary use.
   d.   Expiration
The Planning Director must set the time limit of the temporary use permit at
the time of approval, but in no case may the initial approval duration exceed
90 days. Renewals and their duration shall be at the discretion of the Planning
Director.
(Ord. No. 0-2016-8; 1/27/16)
   e.   Violations, Penalties, and Revocation
      Violation of any term, condition, requirement, or duration of a temporary
use permit approved under this division is unlawful, must constitute a
violation of this development code.  The violator may be subject to penalties
set forth in Sec.
10-774.  In addition, the temporary use permit may be revoked or suspended by
the city council due to such violation, following public hearings by both the
planning and zoning commission and the city council.

and grubbing, or other earth changes made to any property within the City.  A
separate permit shall be required for each separate, non-contiguous site or
lot.  (Ord. No. 0-99-19; 2/24/99)
Sec. 10-757.   Policies for Issuance
   The issuance of a grading permit shall be governed by these policies and
those set forth in the City Drainage Design Guideline Manual.
   a.   Earth changes shall be permitted which do not create a public hazard
upon any property within the City through obstruction, impairment,

otherwise change any drainage facility in a manner inconsistent with the
Drainage Design Guideline Manual, or requirements of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency under the National Flood Insurance Program.
   c.   Earth changes shall be permitted which will not, in the opinion of the
City Engineer, unreasonably increase surface runoff.  However, this Article
does not preclude or prevent the use of regional or off-site stormwater
detention or retention facilities provided that adequate facilities to convey
increased rates of stormwater runoff to the regional or off-site detention or
retention facility are provided.
   d.   All earth changes shall be designed, constructed and completed so as to
minimize loss of soil from a construction area in accordance with the Drainage
Design Guideline Manual.
   e.   The requirements and conditions for a grading permit for any lot,

Sec. 10-758.   Grading Permit Requirements
A grading permit shall consist of a Drainage Plan or Abbreviated Drainage Plan,
and an Erosion Control Plan.  The grading permit for any lot to be used for
building construction may not be issued unless the plan has been reviewed and
accepted by the City Engineer.
A  Drainage Plan shall consist of engineering drawings, contour maps, Erosion
Control Plan and all supporting engineering calculations, as applicable to the
land area covered by the Plan, which are required to demonstrate full
compliance with this Article, the City of Tyler Design Guidelines for
Subdivision Improvements, Best Management Practices of the U.S. Corp. of
Engineers, Texas Council of Governments, or other Best Management Practices
acceptable to the City Engineer.
   a.   Abbreviated Drainage Plans.  Upon review of a grading permit
application, the City Engineer shall determine if an Abbreviated Drainage Plan
is necessary in order to meet the purposes of this Article.  If an Abbreviated
Drainage Plan is required, it shall be submitted to and reviewed by the City
Engineer prior to granting of the grading permit.  Although the Abbreviated
Drainage Plan does not require the seal or signature of a registered
professional engineer, it must be prepared according to the City format, as
described in Section
10-529.  An Abbreviated Drainage Plan will generally be sufficient for
construction of single-family residences on subdivision lots.  An Erosion
Control Plan is required.  An Abbreviated Drainage Plan is applicable to
development sites of less than one (1) acre, and for all single-family
residential lots.
   b.   Drainage Plans.  Upon review of an application for a grading permit,
the City Engineer shall determine if a Drainage Plan is necessary to meet the
purposes of this Article.  If a Drainage Plan is required, it shall be
submitted to and reviewed by the City Engineer prior to granting of the grading
permit.  Drainage Plans are required on all development sites greater than one
(1) acre, except for single-family residential lots.
   c.    The Drainage Plan, but not the Abbreviated Drainage Plan, shall be
prepared and implemented under the direct supervision of a registered
professional engineer, licensed to practice in the State, according to a City
format.    Each plan submitted for final review and acceptance shall bear the
signature and seal of the submitting engineer under the following statement: “I
hereby certify that I am familiar with the adopted ordinances, regulations,
standards and policies of the City governing development, that these plans have
been prepared under my supervision, and that this Drainage Plan complies with
all governing ordinances and regulations to the best of my knowledge.”
   d.   If the site in question lies outside an area of special flood hazard,
the plans shall bear the signature of the engineer or applicant under the
following statement: “No part of this site lies within the established area of
special flood hazard as established by the current flood insurance study of
Flood Hazard Boundary Map. (Ord. No. 0-99-19; 2/24/99)
Sec. 10-759.   Exemptions

the permit holder stating the grounds for such action.  A grading permit may be
revoked or suspended upon one (1) or more of the following:
      1.   Violation of any conditions of the permit and any associated
Drainage Plan or Abbreviated Drainage Plan after notification of non-compliance
and failure to take remedial actions as outlined in these sections.
      2.   Violation of any applicable law, ordinance, or regulation pertaining
to the grading permit contained in this Article after written notification of
non-compliance;
      3.   Existence of any condition or performance of any act constituting a
hazard or endangering human life or property. (Ord. No. 0-99-19; 2/24/99)
Sec. 10-761.   Compliance
   a.   Unless exempted under this Article, it is unlawful to conduct any
development, excavating, grading, regrading, excavating, landfilling, beaming,
paving, diking, clearing and grubbing, or other earth changes either without a
grading permit required under this Article, or contrary to the terms of a
grading permit issued under this Article.
   b.   Upon revocation or suspension of a grading permit issued under this
Article, it shall be unlawful to continue to conduct any development,
excavating, grading, regrading, landfilling, beaming, paving, diking, clearing
and grubbing, or other earth changes without having a valid grading permit in
effect.
   c.   If it is determined that an individual is conducting activities without
a grading permit required under this Article, or upon revocation or suspension
of a grading permit, the City Engineer may issue a stopwork order on all
construction activity on the individual’s property which may be directly or
indirectly related to site drainage and which is being performed pursuant to
any permits, licenses, franchises or contracts issued by the City.  Such
stopwork order may order a work stoppage on all construction activity on
buildings or structures and all appurtenances thereto, including building,
electrical, plumbing, mechanical, street work, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, gas
lines and all utilities.  Notices in writing and orders required by this
Division shall be considered effective if served upon the parties concerned
either personally or by certified mail, addressed to the individual,
contracting party, or permittee  at the address given on the contract document
or permit application filed with the City.
   d.   In addition to the enforcement and penalties provided for in this
Article, no certificate of occupancy for buildings or structures may be issued
until the grading and drainage of the site has been constructed in accordance
with the Plan required by this Division.
   e.   When a grading permit and Drainage Plan are required prior to issuance
of a building permit, the structure for which the building permit is issued may
not be used, occupied, or receive a certificate of occupancy unless the
facilities as shown on the accepted Drainage Plan have been completed by the
permit applicant or representative and reviewed and accepted by the City.  Such
acceptance will be made on the basis of certified as-built drawings prepared by
a registered professional engineer.  If the structure is in a designated
special flood hazard area, it may not be used or occupied until an elevation
certificate, properly completed, has been filed with the City.
   f.   Each day that a violation of this Division shall continue, or be
permitted to continue, shall be deemed a separate offense. (Ord. No. 0-99-19;
2/24/99)

Notes:
References to the existing Publication Fee, Refundable Zoning Sign Deposit and
Recording Fee are deleted from the Chart above and are included below.  These 
existing fees [a], [b], and [c], are added to the fees above, where
applicable.  The intent is to include these existing fees with the fees above,
where applicable, to make payment easier. In addition, the Notification Fee,
which historically has been mailed to the applicant after the total number of
required mailings has been determined, has been added as a lump sum  to allow
applicants to pay all fees upfront.  Staff performed a study on the average
number of notices sent per zoning case, and determined the average Notification
Fee to be $20.00.  Therefore, the current reference to a .50 Notification Fee
per mailed notification  is deleted.   
[a] Includes mandatory $30 publication and $20 mailed notification required for
owners whose property is within 200 feet of the proposed action.
[b] Includes $20 Zoning Sign Deposit (refundable upon sign's return)
[c] Includes the City fee only.  An additional recording fee in the amount
published by the Smith County Clerk must also be paid.
[d] The Outdoor Transient Vendor permit fee shall not be required for a Non-
Profit.
Non Profit - An organization or entity formed for the purpose of serving a
purpose of public or mutual benefit other than the pursuit or accumulation of
profits, i.e., 501(c)(3)s, schools, religious organizations, governmental
organizations. Proof of non
profit status is required. All other entities/individuals will be charged the
regular rate. 
[e] Late submittal convenience fee equals 50% of total application fee added to
application fee.

letter described herein to the Neighborhood Services Director. 
   d.   Procedure for Board Review and Public Hearing before City Council under
certain circumstances: 
      1.   Upon review of the Application for Certificate of Appropriateness
for Rehabilitation or for Certificate of Demolition, and considering the Chief
Building Official’s recommendations, the Board shall determine:
         (a)   Whether demolition is recommended, if applicable, or whether the
proposed rehabilitation work will adversely affect any exterior architectural
feature or adversely affect the historical character of the building, structure
or site;
         (b)   Whether any proposed work is consistent with the guidelines in
the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings;
         (c)   Whether such work is appropriate and consistent with the spirit
and intent of this chapter; and
         (d)   Whether sufficient evidence of financial resources to complete
the work has been presented.
         (e)   Time for completion.  As part of the review of an application
for a Certificate of Appropriateness or for a Certificate of Demolition, the
Board may recommend a specific time period for completion of all work under the
Certificate of Appropriateness or Certificate of Demolition.  When considering
the specific time for completion in each individual case, the Board and City
Council may take into account the proposed scope of the work, the size and
dimensions of the property, the cost of the work, and any other specific
circumstances affecting the particular building, structure or property.  If
work under a Certificate of Appropriateness or Certificate of Demolition issued
under this section has not been completed within the time period established 
pursuant to this subsection, the person or entity must file an application for
a new Certificate of Appropriateness or Certificate of Demolition pursuant to
this section.  It shall be unlawful for a person or entity to perform work
governed by an expired Certificate of Appropriateness or Certificate of
Demolition without obtaining a new Certificate of Appropriateness or
Certificate of Demolition.
      2.   If the Board's decision on a Certificate of Appropriateness is
appealed to the City Council pursuant to Chapter 1, Article IV., or if the
Board conducts a hearing on a property that has been tagged as substandard
under Chapter 7 or for which a Certificate of Demolition is being sought, then
the Planning Department shall place the Board's recommendation on the next
available City Council agenda. The Board's recommendations shall be forwarded
to the City Council, which shall have final authority to grant a Certificate of
Appropriateness for Rehabilitation or Certificate of Demolition, as
applicable.  If the City Council is considering an appeal of a Certificate of
Appropriateness pursuant to Chapter 1, Article IV., then notice of the date,
time and place of such hearing before the City Council shall be provided to the
property owner.  If the City Council is conducting a hearing on a property that
has been tagged as substandard under Chapter 7 or for which a Certificate of
Demolition is being sought, notice of such hearing before the City Council will
be provided to the property owner and known mortgagees and lien holders by
certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted signature at least ten
(10) days prior to the hearing.  At either type of hearing, the City Council
shall review the Board recommendation and make a final decision regarding the
issuance of a Certificate under this chapter. 
      3.   Following the board’s or City Council's decision, as applicable, the
Planning Department shall either hand-deliver or forward to the property owner
within two (2) days of the hearing, the following:
         (a)   For situations not involving a substandard structure and not
involving a request for Certificate of Demolition, in which only the board
conducted a hearing:
                                                (1)    A Certificate of
Appropriateness for Rehabilitation, which shall include a copy of the Secretary
of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings; or
                     (2)   Notice that the board has made a determination that
the proposed work would adversely affect the historic character of the site or
structure and a recommendation of an alternative course of action which would
preserve the historic character of the structure;                             
     
                             (b)    For situations not involving a substandard
structure and not involving a request for Certificate of Demolition, in which
the board conducted a hearing, but the board’s decision was appealed to the
City Council pursuant to City Code Chapter 1, Article IV.:
                                               
                                                (1)    A Certificate of
Appropriateness for Rehabilitation, which shall include a copy of the Secretary
of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings; or
                     (2)   Notice that the City Council has made a
determination that the proposed work would adversely affect the historic
character of the site or structure and a recommendation of an alternative
course of action which would preserve the historic character of the structure;
         (c)   For situations involving a substandard structure or request for
Certificate of Demolition, in which the City Council conducted a hearing in
addition to the board hearing:
                                              (1)     A Certificate of
Appropriateness for Rehabilitation, which shall include a copy of the Secretary
of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating  Historic Structures; or
                                              (2)     Notice that the City
Council has made a determination that the proposed work would adversely affect
the historic character of the site or structure and a recommendation of an
alternative course of action which would preserve the historic character of the
structure; or
                                              (3)     Certificate of Demolition
which shall mandate that demolition and clearance shall be completed by a date
certain.
                                     (4)    Appeal to District Court:  An
interested party may appeal the final decision of the City Council to the
district court by filing a verified petition within thirty (30) days of the
date the Certificate or other final notice is provided to the party pursuant to
this Chapter.  On expiration of the thirty (30) day appeal period, any City
Council decision shall be final.
   e.   Issuance of Building permit: A building permit consistent with a
Certificate issued under this chapter may be applied for and issued following
the appropriate board or City Council hearing. (Ord. No. 0-98-81, 10/7/98)
   f.   Temporary Emergency Repair Orders. If the Chief Building Official, in
consultation with the Neighborhood Services Director, if applicable, determines
that a building or structure designated on the Tyler historic landmark register
poses an immediate threat to persons or property, the Chief Building Official
may order or conduct any temporary emergency repairs necessary to make the
building or structure safe without the requirement of a Certificate of
Appropriateness for Rehabilitation.  The Chief Building Official shall send the
Board a written Temporary Emergency Repair Order explaining the work done to
remove the immediate threat. However, once such temporary emergency repairs
have been completed, no further work may be done on the building or structure
unless a Certificate of Appropriateness for Rehabilitation is obtained pursuant
to this section.  If the City incurs costs associated with abating the
immediate threat and the City desires to assess costs against the owner, a
certified statement of costs shall be prepared by the Chief Building Official,
verified by the Chief Financial Officer, and forwarded to the property owner by
certified mail, return receipt requested, with instructions regarding the
owner’s responsibility to pay those costs.  The City may place a lien on the
property for unpaid costs associated with this section by filing an affidavit
of lien and the certified statement of charges with the ’’’’Smith’ ’’County’’
land records. It is unlawful to fail to comply with a Temporary Emergency
Repair Order issued by the Chief Building Official. (Ord. 0-99-52, 7/21/99)

Tax Abatement
Sec. 10-793.   Tax Abatement
In accordance with state law, the City Council finds that all designated
landmarks structures are historically significant and entitled to tax relief in
order to encourage historic preservation.  Fifty percent (50%) of the assessed
value of any building, structure or site listed on the Tyler historic landmark
register and the land necessary for access to and from the building, structure,
or site, up to a maximum assessed value amount of $ 2,000,000, must be exempt
from annual City ad valorem taxation, provided that such building, structure or
site is listed on the register on the first day of January of the applicable
tax year.  As long as the property remains on the Tyler historic landmark
register, has not changed ownership, and otherwise remains in compliance with
all applicable ordinances, the owner shall not be required to re-apply for
exemption on an annual basis.  (Ord. 0-98-81, 10/7/98); (Ord. 0-2005-61; 8/17/
05) (Ord. No. 0-2012-83, 10/10/12)
Sec. 10-794.   Tax Abatements for Historic Landmarks
   a.   The tax abatement provided for in this section is intended to encourage
historic preservation within the City of Tyler.  Any building or structure that
has been designated as a historic landmark pursuant to the terms of this
Article, and which is substantially rehabilitated as provided herein, may have
abated one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of any increase in the assessed
value for purposes of ad valorem taxes levied by the City of Tyler in excess of
the assessed value of the property for a period of five (5) years following
issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness.  Said tax abatement must only
apply to the increase in the assessed value of the property over the assessed
base value of the property, regardless of the actual value of any permits and
improvements.  In order to be eligible for tax abatement, said renovations must
be at a minimum cost of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) and must be
completed within a period of two (2) years from the date of issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness.  The tax abatements would become applicable to
the property in January of the first tax year following the date of issuance of
a Certificate of Appropriateness.  The tax abatements must continue in effect
during the established five-year period as long as the property remains on the
Tyler historic landmark register.  The total amount of said improvements
subject to tax abatement per year for the five-year period on a single piece of
property must not exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000). 
   b.   To be eligible for property tax abatement under this section, a
property must meet the following requirements:
      1.   The building or structure must meet the requirements for, and have
previously been designated as, a historic landmark pursuant to section

      4.   Any renovations or improvements must conform to the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings, a copy of which is available in the Planning Department.
   c.   Application process.  Applications for tax abatement under this section
are voluntary.  Any owner seeking tax abatement under this section must file an
application for a Certificate of Appropriateness in conformance with section
10-786 .  Said application must include a projection of the estimated
construction time and predicted completion date of the historic repair or
rehabilitation.  The requirements of sections
10-786  and
10-783  must govern the application, granting and removal, and maintenance
process for the Certificate of Appropriateness.  However, the actual granting
of the tax abatement under this section shall be subject to the discretion and
approval of the City Council.  After a public hearing, the City Council may by
ordinance approve the abatement provided for in this section.  If approved by
City Council, the applicant for abatement shall cause a copy of the ordinance
and application for exemption to be sent to the Smith County Appraisal District
not later than January 1st of each subject tax year. (Ord. No. 0-2017-69; 8/23/
17)
   d.   Time for completion; re-capture.  If the improvements, renovation or
restoration repair work on a particular piece of property are not completed
within two (2) years from the date of issuance of the Certificate of
Appropriateness, any and all tax abatements previously received on said
property during the two-year period must be revoked, and the City may re-
capture all tax abatements that the property owner received during said two-
year period.  In addition to the re-capture, the property owner shall not be
eligible for the tax abatement for the remaining three (3) years. 
   e.   Eligible costs.  Eligible costs must include construction,
reconstruction, alteration, change, restoration, removal or demolition of any

(Ord. 0-97-2, 1/22/97)
Sec. 10-801.   Annexation Goals and Policies
Texas cities derive their annexation authority from state law. 
As a home rule city, Tyler has the right to annex voluntarily or involuntarily
any area within its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) or any city-owned
property, subject to State law requirements. The ETJ includes the
unincorporated area within five miles of the city limits, excluding any area
that is legally existing in the ETJ of another city. Within its ETJ, the city
also has the right to approve the creation of other political jurisdictions,
and enforce its subdivisions.
Annexation is one of the most important tools available to cities in Texas to
determine their future. In recognition of that fact and based upon the
authority outlined above, the city adopts the following annexation goals and
policies. Because the parameters bearing on specific annexations and boundary
adjustments vary so considerably, these goals and policies are intended as
flexible guidelines to be followed rather than as absolute mandates. Also, the
intent of all the policies together should be considered rather than one policy
individually.  (Ord. No. 0-2005-22, 3/23/05)
   a.   Goal I: Preserve the city's range of annexation options
      The authority granted to Texas home rule cities to fix and extend their
boundaries and to exchange areas with other municipalities is very broad. The
city should exercise that authority when appropriate and vigorously oppose any
effort to reduce it.
      1.   Policies
         (a)   The city may, at its discretion, annex any lands within its
exclusive ETJ in accordance with state laws and the City Charter.
         (b)   The city should consider annexation for the purpose of enforcing
health and safety regulations and improving the quality of life.
         (c)   The city should vigorously pursue violations of its ETJ to the
fullest extent allowable by law.
   b.   Goal II: Promote orderly growth and provision of municipal services
      Within unincorporated areas in Texas, there are very limited development
controls. Annexation of areas facing development pressures can ensure proper
land use relationships and high standards of construction through the Tyler
Unified Development Code and building codes, thereby assuring adequate health
and safety standards and averting costly future problems for the city.
      When a major city remains viable, it can usually provide more services
and a higher level of service than can a smaller community. This is
particularly true in the Tyler metropolitan area where the city is so much
larger than the other incorporated cities.  Because of its size, the city
expends considerable resources planning for development and major thoroughfares
within its ETJ. Annexation allows the city to enjoy the benefits of that
investment in planning.
      1.   Policies:
         (a)   The city should consider annexing areas facing the prospect of
development as a means of effectively controlling the quality of growth through
the extension of the city's zoning and other regulations.
         (b)   The city should annex city-owned property when appropriate as
soon as possible after acquisition.
         (c)   Prospective annexation areas should be evaluated to determine
their impact on existing services and city budget.
   c.   Goal III: Enhance the city's fiscal position
      As the major city and cultural center of the region, the city provides
and supports many services which are available to residents of unincorporated
areas, as well as to those within the city limits. Annexation provides a means
for the city to recoup partially the costs of these services.
      Annexation also provides a means for the city to avoid a dwindling tax
base. Unlike many states, Texas cities have considerable authority to annex
adjacent unincorporated areas. There is a very good reason for this. In parts
of the nation, where cities are unable to annex, there is a tendency for those
who can afford to do so to escape city taxes and problems in favor of the
suburbs. The result is that such cities are abandoned to their poorer citizens,
with their needs growing while their resources diminish. While inner city
housing ages and depreciates in value, new housing occurs primarily on the city
fringe, primarily outside the city limits. Commercial and industrial centers
then follow the population trend away from the center city. Without annexation,
the city could be faced with decreasing rather than increasing resources.
      By retaining control over its planning area, the city can plan for the
most efficient design and use of its infrastructure, particularly its utilities
and major thoroughfares. Annexation can also prevent or inhibit the further
fragmentation of government, thereby reducing the total cost of government for
citizens in the region decreasing the difficulties of resolving multi-
jurisdictional problems.
      1.   Policies
         (a)   The city should consider annexation to protect the city's fiscal
viability by extending its tax base for ad valorem taxes, including both real
and personal property, and sales taxes and to maintain the city's bond rating.
         (b)   The city should consider annexing nonresidential areas as a
means of maximizing the city's investment return.
         (c)   Areas which are in need of municipal services, but would create
a fiscal liability to the city, should be annexed in conjunction with other
areas which would generate offsetting revenue surpluses.
         (d)   Cost-revenue analyses for prospective annexation areas should be
estimated for at least 10 years after annexation. Identified capital costs
should include estimated debt service as determined by the Finance Department.
         (e)   Annexation costs should be considered budgetary mandates.
         (f)   Areas to be annexed are eligible to receive city water and sewer
services as provided in the Tyler Code.
         (g)   The city should consider annexation to extend its ETJ to provide
development controls to areas it deems are in need of such controls.
         (h)   The city should oppose the creation of additional cities,
special purpose districts, and water or wastewater utilities within its ETJ
unless the city determines it is not responsible and cost effective to provide
the necessary services.
         (i)   The city may annex areas to preclude the creation of other
political jurisdictions.
         (j)   The city should consider the following criteria prior to
releasing any portion of its corporate limits or ETJ to another city:
            (1)   There should be an exchange of areas of equivalent value with
the other jurisdiction;
            (2)   The other city should have adequate land use controls (as
determined by the city) to protect the subject area and provide assurances that
these controls will remain in effect;
            (3)   The existing city limit or ETJ is not a logical planning
boundary;
            (4)   Potentially significant negative fiscal impacts on the city's
budget will not result if the area is released; and
            (5)   The area does not contain environmental resources in need of
city protection.
   d.   Goal V: Maintain a Systematic Annexation Process
      The process by which unincorporated areas are selected for annexation
should be clearly understood and designed to predict when a particular area
will be annexed with some degree of certainty. Such a process would assist in
providing timely extensions of public infrastructure systems and in estimating
city revenues. Property owners would also benefit by knowing when their
properties will receive municipal services and when taxes will be assessed.
      1.   Policies
         (a)   Annexation and disannexation petitions should be considered on
an individual basis and referred to the city attorney for a determination of
sufficiency as to form and legality.
         (b)   In accordance with state law, the city will prepare an
annexation plan identifying prospective annexation areas for the next three
years. The plan will be amended as needed.  (Ord. 0-97-2, 1/22/97); (Ord. No.
0-99-94, 12/15/99) 
Sec. 10-802.   City Limits in 1999
Section 41.003 of the Texas Local Government Code provides that an irrebuttable
presumption attaches to the inclusion within the city of any area that has been
functionally a part of the city for 20 years.  City records indicate that the
area designated in the Exhibit "A" which is attached to the ordinance adopting
this section has been a part of the city for at least the preceding 20 years
and the city has provided municipal services, including police protection, to
the area and has treated the area as part of the city during the preceding 20
years.  City records also indicate that there has not been a final judicial
determination during the preceding 20 years that the area is outside of the
boundaries of the city, and that there is no pending lawsuit that challenges
the inclusion of the area as part of the city.  Therefore, the City Council
finds that the requirements of state law for inclusion of the area have been
met and the inclusion of the area designated in Exhibit A is not contestable.

of these two locations become vacant and Concessionaire is unable to fill that
space with a new advertiser within 90 days, Airport has the right to pursue an
occupant for a one year advertising lease or other alternative opportunities
followed by a month to month tenancy. Concessionaire may resume its efforts to
lease the Specialty Floor Display space concurrently with Airport at the end of
the one year lease term.  If Airport secures a lessee for the space described,
Airport would receive 100% of the lease proceeds from the Specialty Floor
Display space which was secured by Airport.  However nothing would prevent
Concessionaire from continuing its efforts to lease the Specialty Floor Display
space for advertising until Airport notified Concessionaire that the space was
leased.  (Ord. No. 0-2016-50; 6/08/16)

      1.   City owns and controls that certain Airport and air navigation
facility located in Smith County, Texas, and known as Tyler Pounds Regional
Airport ("Airport"); and
      2.   The Airport promotes a strong economic base for the community,
assists and encourages world trade opportunities, and is of vital importance to
the health, safety and welfare of the State; and
      3.   The Airport is a commercial service airport as that phrase is
defined in 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 158, as adopted by FAA, being a
public airport enplaning two thousand five hundred (2,500) or more scheduled

      4.   The deregulation of the airline industry, the restructuring of
airline ownerships, and fluctuating market changes in the field of commercial
aviation have placed new financial challenges on City; and

attracting scheduled airline passenger service by airline carriers at the
Airport imposes financial responsibility on City for Airport facilities and
operations; and

Sec. 15-2. Supervisor of public utilities.
   In accordance with the provisions of
section 40 of the City Charter, the City Manager is appointed as the supervisor
of public utilities and shall have the responsibility subject to City Council
approval, to engage all rate consultants, accountants, auditors, engineers or
any combination thereof as may be necessary to administer this chapter.  (Ord.
No. O-96-70, 8-21-96)
Sec. 15-3. Just and reasonable rates.
   a.   It is the duty of the City Council to ensure that every rate made,
demanded or received by any regulated entity shall be just and reasonable.
Rates shall not be unreasonably preferential, prejudicial or discriminatory,
but shall be sufficient, equitable and consistent in application to each class
of consumers. The City Council shall establish a rate schedule which will
produce sufficient revenue to permit such utility to recover necessary
operating expenses together with a reasonable return on its invested capital.
   b.   The City Council shall not prescribe any rate which will yield more
than a fair return upon the adjusted value of the invested capital used and
useful in rendering service to the public. In any proceeding involving any
proposed change of rates, the burden of proof shall be on the regulated entity
to show that the proposed change proposed by the regulated entity, or that the
existing rate, if it is proposed to reduce the rate, is just and reasonable. 
(Ord. No. O-96-70, 8-21-96)
Sec. 15-4. Rate determination.
a.   Upon petition for a change of rates by the regulated entity, or upon
motion of the City Council, the City Manager shall require from the regulated
entity all data necessary to make a reasonable determination of rate base,
expenses, investment and rate of return within the City limits. The City
Manager may further require financial data pertaining to operations outside the
City  as necessary to make a reasonable determination of rate base, expenses,
investment and rate of return within the City limits. The regulated entity
shall submit the required information in a form approved by the City Manager
(which may be in a form used by a state regulatory agency with jurisdiction
over similar regulated entities providing services outside of the City
limits).  If the regulated entity fails to provide the necessary documentation
or other information supporting the costs and expenses shown in the
application, the City Manager may reject the petition pursuant to Section 15-
4.d., or the City Council may disallow the unsupported costs and expenses in
setting new rates. The City Manager shall retain all necessary personnel to
make the determination of reasonable rates.
b.     The City Manager or designees shall have the right, at reasonable times
and for reasonable purposes, to inspect and obtain copies of the papers, books,
accounts, documents and other business records, and to inspect the plant,
equipment and other property of any regulated entity within its jurisdiction.
The City Manager or designee may require, by order or subpoena served on any
regulated entity, the production of any books, accounts, papers or records kept
by that regulated entity.  Failure to produce requested books, accounts, papers
or records by a regulated entity shall be considered to be a violation
enforceable under Section 1-4 of this code and may be used as a basis by the
City Council or City Manager to reject a petition for a change of rates
submitted pursuant to Section 15-4.a., and additionally may be a basis to
revoke a regulated entity’s franchise.
   c.     This section shall not be construed as a limitation upon the power of
the City to discover and inspect financial information and business records of
the regulated entity. In addition to the foregoing powers, the City shall have
all rights of discovery as provided under the statutes and common law of this
state.
   d.   At any time before the proposed effective date, the City Manager may
reject the regulated entity’s petition for a change of rates and suspend the
rate change if the petition contains any of the following deficiencies:
      1. The regulated entity has failed to  complete the rate application
properly;
      2. The regulated entity has included in the cost of service rate case
expenses other than those necessary to complete and file the rate change
application;
      3. The regulated entity has failed to comply with the notice and proof of
notice requirements required by the City Manager; or
      4. The regulated entity has outstanding amounts owed to the City:
         (a) pursuant to its franchise agreement;
         (b) for reimbursement of expenses under Section 15-5; or
         (c) for violations of City Code. 
The proposed effective date shall be suspended until a properly completed
application is accepted by the City Manager and the regulated entity shall not
renotify its customers of a new proposed effective date until the regulated
entity receives written notification from the City Manager that all
deficiencies have been corrected. (Ord. No. 0-2013-12; 2/13/13)
   e.   Upon the request of the City Manager or upon receipt of petitions from
the lesser of 1,000 or 10 percent of the ratepayers of a regulated entity
located inside the City limits, the application for rate change shall be set
for hearing by the City Council.  If an application is set for hearing, the
effective date of the rate change shall be suspended for the longest period
allowed by law or until the City Council adopts an ordinance setting new rates,
whichever is sooner.  If the City Council has not set a new rate by the
expiration of all lawful suspension periods, the application shall be deemed to
have been denied, and the regulated entity’s prior rates shall remain in
effect.  A deemed denial is subject to the City Council’s authority to make a
final decision after the end of the suspension period. (Ord. 0-2011-33, 5/11/
11)
Sec. 15-5. Reimbursement of expenses.
       At the conclusion of any rate proceeding before the City Council
including any appeal of the City Council’s decision to a state regulatory
agency, the regulated entity shall reimburse the City for the reasonable cost
of the services of rate consultants, accountants, auditors, attorneys,
engineers or any combination thereof, to conduct investigations, present
evidence, advise and represent the City.  The City Manager or designees shall
submit an invoice for the reasonable cost of the services to the regulated
entity at any time during or after the conclusion of a rate proceeding.  The
regulated entity shall pay the invoice in full within 30 days of receipt of the
invoice.  If the regulated entity disputes any costs, the regulated entity may
petition the City Council for review of such costs, but such a petition does
not relieve the regulated entity of its obligation to pay.  Failure to pay the
costs as invoiced shall be a basis for the City to reject any rate applications
filed by the regulated entity until the invoice is paid in full and shall be a

   c.   This subsection c. applies only if, after the effective date of this
Franchise Agreement, Company enters into a new municipal franchise agreement or
renews an existing municipal franchise agreement with another municipality that
provides for a different method of calculation of Franchise Fees for use of the
Public Rights-of-Way than the calculation of the Statutory Franchise Fee under
33.008(b) of PURA, which, if applied to the City, would result in a greater
amount of franchise fees owed the City than under this Franchise Agreement.
City shall have the option to:
      1.   Have Company select, within 30 business days of the City’s
request’’,’ any or all portions of the franchise agreement with the other
municipality or comparable provisions that’’,’ at Company’s sole discretion’’,’
m’’us’t be considered in conjunction with the different method of the
calculation of franchise fees included in that other franchise agreement; and

include the different method of calculation of franchise fee found in the
franchise agreement with the other municipality without this Franchise also
being modified to include all of the other provisions in the Franchise
Agreement with the other Muncipality that is identified by Company pursuant to
Section 15-88.a.
   City may not exercise the option provided in Section 15-88.c. if any of the
provisions that would be included in this Franchise are, in Company’s sole
opinion, inconsistent with or in any manner contrary to any then-current rule,
regulation, ordinance, law, Code, or Charter of City.  In the event that
Company makes such a determination of inconsistency or contrariness, Company
shall provide written notice of such action to City.  If the City disagrees
with the Company’s determination, City shall be given an opportunity to present
facts or arguments in defending its position that said provisions are not
inconsistent with and are not contrary to any then-current rule, regulation,
ordinance, law, Code, or Charter of City.  After consideration of City’s
response, Company shall have discretion to make the final decision regarding
the determination of inconsistency or contrariness.  In the event of a
regulatory disallowance of the increase in franchise fees paid pursuant to
City’s exercise of its option under this subsection c. then at any time after
the regulatory authority’s entry of an order disallowing recovery of the
additional franchise fee expense in rates’’,’ Company shall have the right to
cancel the modification of the Franchise made pursuant to this Section’’,’ and
terms of the Franchise shall immediately revert to those in place prior to
City’s exercise of its option under this subsection c. 
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Franchise, should the City
exercise the option provided in Section 15-88.c. and then adopt any rule,
regulation, ordinance, law,Code, or Charter of City that, in Company’s sole
opinion, is inconsistent with or in any manner contrary to the provisions
included in this Franchise pursuant to Section 15-88.c., then Company shall
have the right to cancel all of the modifications to this Franchise made
pursuant to this Section.  In the event that Company makes such a determination
of inconsistency or contrariness, Company shall provide written notice of such
action to City.  If the City disagrees with the Company’s determination, City
shall be given an opportunity to present facts or arguments in defending its
position that said rule, regulation, ordinance, law, Code or Charter provision
is not inconsistent with and is not contrary to this Franchise.  After
consideration of City’s response, Company shall have discretion to make the
final decision regarding cancellation of the modifications pursuant to this
subsection.  If Company exercises its authority to cancel the modifications to
this Franchise under this Section, then the terms of the Franchise shall revert
to those in place prior to City’s exercise of its option under this subsection
c and be effective as of the date of the City’s adoption of the inconsistent
provision.
   The provisions of this subsection c. apply only to the amount of the
Franchise Fee to be paid and do not apply to other franchise fee payment
provisions, such as the timing of such payments.  The provisions of this
subsection c. do not apply to differences in the franchise fee factor that

for the purpose of determining the amount due to the City under this
Franchise.  Pursuant to Section 33.008(e) of the Texas Utilities Code, the City

less than two (2) years before the commencement of such audit or inquiry. The

an overpayment, or pays the City for an underpayment, of the franchise fee,
such refund/credit or payment shall be made pursuant to the terms established
in Section 15-88.a. and b.
      2.   If as a result of a subsequent audit, initiated within two years of
an audit which resulted in Company making a payment to the City due to an
underpayment of the franchise fee of more than 5%, Company makes another
payment to the City due to an underpayment of the franchise fee of more than
5%,the City may immediately treat this underpayment as an Uncured Event of

will provide Company with a copy of this notification’’,’ andthereafter Company

any ordinance providing the contrary.  The City shall cooperate with Company
and use its best efforts in granting any permission required.  All Facilities
erected by Company within the Public Rights-of-Way shall be so located as to
cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of

repair, remove or abate any Company structure, equipment or installation that
is unnecessarily dangerous to life or property.  After receipt of said written
notice, Company shall either cure said dangerous condition within a reasonable
time, or provide City with facts or arguments in refuting or defending its
position that said condition is not a condition that is unnecessarily dangerous

incur unreasonable delay or expense.  In the event that Company has not

facilities, such abandonment shall be conditioned on Company's right to
maintain its use of the former Public Rights-of-Way and on the obligation of
the party to whom the Public Rights-of-Way is abandoned to reimburse Company
for all removal or relocation expenses if Company agrees to the removal or
relocation of its facilities following abandonment of the Public Rights-of-
Way.  If the party to whom the Public Rights-of-Way is abandoned requests the
Company to remove or relocate its facilities and Company agrees to such removal
or relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable
time at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation.  If

payable on such sums shall be credited to customers.

to the City Council.  After the final passage and approval of this Ordinance by

Sec. 15-204.  No Third Party Beneficiaries.

Sec. 15-205.  Successors and Assigns
The rights granted by this Franchise inure to the benefit of Company. 
a.   Company may, without consent by the City, transfer or assign the rights
granted by this Franchise to an Affiliate of Company provided that such
Affiliate assumes all obligations of Company hereunder and is bound to the same
extent as Company hereunder, and has net capital and liquid assets reasonably
equivalent to Company’s as of the month immediately preceding the transfer or
there are provided other guarantees or assurances of the transferee’s or
assignee’s financial ability to perform this Franchise reasonably acceptable to
the City.  Company shall give City written notice thirty (30) days prior to
such assignment.
b.   City will have the right to approve the transfer or assignment of this
Franchise except as provided in Section 15-205 a., provided that City may not
unreasonably withhold or delay approval to a transfer or assignment of this
Franchise.  City shall not be obligated to approve any assignment if the
assignee or transferee is materially weaker than Company.  For the purpose of

debt rating of the assignee or transferee is less than investment grade as
rated by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, a division of McGraw Hill, Inc.
or its successor (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or its successor
(“Moody’s”).  If the long term unsecured debt rating of the assignee or
transferee is not rated by S&P and Moody’s or, if rated, such rating is
materially weaker than that of Company, the City agrees to request and review
such additional documents and information reasonably related to the transaction
and the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the assignee or
transferee, and that said approval shall not be withheld solely on the basis of
such ratings, or the lack of such ratings.  Any such assignment or transfer
shall require that said assignee or transferee assume all obligations of
Company to be bound to the same extent as Company hereunder.  If within the
first ninety (90) days after assignment or transfer to assignee or transferee,
City identifies a failure to comply with a material provision of this
Franchise, City shall have the right, after notice and opportunity for hearing
before Council, to terminate this Franchise. 
Sec. 15-206.  Compliance with Laws, Charter and Ordinances
This Franchise is granted subject to the laws of the United States of America
and its regulatory agencies and commissions and the laws of the State of Texas,
the Tyler City Charter, as amended, and all other applicable ordinances of
City, not inconsistent herewith, including, but not limited to, ordinances
generally applicable to regulating the use of Public Rights-of-Way.
Sec. 15-207.  Intentionally Left Blank
Sec. 15-208.  Notices

b.   The Company shall provide to the City a local or toll-free telephone
number that is manned twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week to
provide available information relating to emergency situations.  The City
understands that this telephone number is not equipped to handle calls from the
public, and the City will not provide this number to customers, but will direct
them to the Company's Call Center.  If the Company cannot timely respond to an
emergency with Company employees, the Company will attempt to respond to the
emergency with qualified local contractors.  The Company's contact information
shall be kept current at all times.  The Company and the City shall
periodically, and upon request by either party, meet to discuss and address
emergency response issues, in order to rectify any problems identified by
either party.
Sec. 15-209.  Paragraph Headings, Construction
The paragraph headings contained in this Ordinance are for convenience only and
shall in no way enlarge or limit the scope or meaning of the various and
several paragraphs hereof.  Both parties have participated in the preparation
of this Ordinance and this Ordinance shall not be construed either more or less
strongly against or for either party.
Sec. 15-210.  Conditions of Occupancy.
All construction and the work done by Company, and the operation of its
business, under and by virtue of this Ordinance, shall be in conformance with
the generally applicable ordinances, rules and regulations now in force,
including but not limited to the “Right-of-Way Management” Chapter of the City
Code of Ordinances, and that may hereafter be adopted by City, relating to the
use of City’s Public Rights-of-Way.  This Franchise shall in no way affect or
impair the rights, obligations or remedies of the parties under the Texas
Utilities Code, or other state or federal law.  Nothing herein shall be deemed
a waiver, release or relinquishment of either party’s right to contest or
appeal any action or decision of the other party, including ordinances adopted
by the City, that it believes is contrary to any federal, state or local law or
regulation.
Sec. 15-211.  Relocation of Company Equipment
a.   Company shall lay, maintain, construct, operate, and replace its pipes,
mains, laterals, and other equipment to minimize interference with traffic,
place or cause to be placed appropriate barriers to mark excavations or
obstructions, and restore to approximate original condition all Public Rights-
of-Way that it may disturb.  In determining the location of the facilities of
the City and other users of Public Right-of-Way within City, City shall
minimize interference with then existing facilities of Company and agrees to
work with Company and other users of Public Rights-of-Way in order to minimize,
to the extent reasonably possible, interference with existing facilities of
Company by other users of Public Rights-of-Way.  In the event of a conflict
between the location of the proposed facilities of Company and the location of
the existing facilities of City or other users of Public Rights-of-Way within
Public Rights-of-Way and the parties involved have been unable to resolve such
conflict through their good faith efforts, City or an authorized agent of City
shall resolve the conflict and determine the location of the respective
facilities within the Public Rights-of-Way, subject however to the terms and
conditions of this Franchise and giving effect to generally accepted industry
operational and safety practices. 
Company or contractors working on behalf of Company shall not be required to
pay for street cutting, street excavation or other special permits related to
excavations in Public Rights-of-Way in connection with Company’s operations in
Public Rights-of-Way. City shall provide Company with its annual capital
improvements plan as well as any updates or changes as soon as the plan,
update, or change becomes available.  City shall notify Company as soon as
reasonably possible of any projects that will affect Company’s facilities
located in the Public Rights-of-Way.  When required by City to remove or
relocate its mains, laterals, and/or other facilities lying within Public
Rights-of-Way, Company shall do so as soon as practically possible with respect
to the scope of the project.  In no event shall Company be required to remove
or relocate its facilities in less than ninety (90) days from the time notice
is given to Company by City.
b.   If City, in constructing its sewers, drainage, water lines, streets, or
utilities, should request that Company remove or relocate its mains, laterals,
and other facilities lying within Public Rights-of-Way, Company shall do so at
its own expense for facilities that are in conflict, unless such work is for
the primary purpose of beautification or to accommodate a private developer.
Facilities are deemed to be in conflict to the extent that the proposed City
facilities are determined by Company to be inconsistent with gas distribution
industry standard safe operating practices for existing facilities.  Company
shall not be required to relocate facilities to a depth of greater than four
(4) feet unless prior agreement is obtained from Company.
When Company is required by City to remove or relocate its mains, laterals, and
other facilities lying within Public Rights-of-Way to accommodate a request by
City, and costs of utility removals or relocations are eligible under federal,
state, county, local or other programs for reimbursement of costs and expenses
incurred by Company as a result of such removal or relocation, and such
reimbursement is required to be handled through City, Company costs and
expenses shall be included in any application by City for reimbursement if
Company submits its cost and expense documentation to City prior to the filing
of the  application. City shall provide Company with reasonable written notice
of the deadline by which the Company must submit documentation of the costs and
expenses of Company’s relocation to City in order for City to be able to submit
its application for reimbursement to such program in a timely manner.  .  In
the event that the City does not provide sufficient written notice to Company
as set forth in this paragraph, and, as a result, the opportunity for Company
to receive reimbursement through City from such program of costs and expenses
incurred by Company as a result of such removal or relocation is lost or
forfeited, then the City shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the
cost of the removal or relocation of Company’s facilities. 
If Company is required by City to remove or relocate its mains, laterals, or
other facilities lying within Public Rights-of-Way for any reason other than
the construction or reconstruction of sewers, drainage, water lines, streets or
utilities by City, Company shall be entitled to reimbursement from City or
others of the cost and expense of such removal or relocation. 
c.   When Company is required to remove or relocate its mains, laterals or
other facilities to accommodate construction by City without reimbursement from
City, Company shall have the right to seek recovery of relocation costs as
provided for in applicable state and/or federal law.  Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit, alter, or modify in any way the right of Company to seek
or recover a surcharge from customers for the cost of relocation pursuant to
applicable state and/or federal law. City shall not oppose recovery of
relocation costs when Company is required by City to perform relocation.  City
shall not require that Company document its request to the City for
reimbursement as a pre-condition to recovery from customers of such relocation
costs pursuant to applicable state and/or federal law.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the City shall have the right to request other project documentation
to the full extent provided by state law.
If City abandons, pursuant to Council action, any Public Right-of-Way in which
Company has facilities, such abandonment shall be conditioned on Company’s
right to maintain its use of the former Public Right-of-Way and on the
obligation of the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned to
reimburse Company for all removal or relocation expenses if Company agrees to
the removal or relocation of its facilities following abandonment of the Public
Right-of-Way by action of City Council.  If the party to whom the Public Right-
of-Way is abandoned requests the Company to remove or relocate its facilities
and Company agrees to such removal or relocation, such removal or relocation
shall be done within a reasonable time at the expense of the party requesting
the removal or relocation. If relocation cannot practically be made to another
Public Right-of-Way, the expense of any right-of-way acquisition shall be
considered a relocation expense to be reimbursed by the party requesting the
relocation.
d.   Upon request by City, Company shall provide maps showing the location of
its facilities and cooperate in locating its facilities when necessary to avoid
conflict and protect the health and safety of the public.
Sec. 15-212.  Laying of Lines in Advance of Paving
a.   Whenever City shall conclude to pave any Public Right-of-Way in which
System Facilities already exist or in which Company may propose to install its
System, Company will be provided the opportunity, at no expense to City, in
advance of such paving to renew such System Facilities, if defective or
inadequate in size, and to lay System Facilities, or renew same, if inadequate
in size or defective, to the property lines where buildings are already
located.
b.   At least ninety (90) calendar days prior to the planned paving or repaving
of Public Rights-of-Way, City shall give Company written notice of the
intention of City to pave any such Public Right-of-Way.  Upon receipt of such
notice, Company shall initiate its review process to determine the need to
renew its System Facilities, and the need to lay or renew service lines
underneath the portions of the Public Rights-of-Way to be paved.  If Company
determines such a need, Company shall promptly initiate such work and shall
thereafter proceed in a good faith and workmanlike manner to completion of the
necessary work within ninety (90) calendar days after receipt of the notice
from the City.  Company’s failure to complete the necessary work within the
ninety (90) day period may be excused at the City’s discretion, if Company has
promptly notified the City of the circumstances that have caused the delay, and
has requested an extension of the construction period.  City shall grant the
extension unless withheld for good cause.
c.   If Company should fail to take advantage of the pre paving opportunity to
undertake new construction or repairs to existing System Facilities in the
Rights-of-Way to be paved, and such street or alley is thereafter paved, except
in an emergency or in response to a request for initiation of new service,
Company shall for two (2) years thereafter not be allowed to cut such pavement
or excavate in such paved street or alley for any purpose, except by written
permission of the City Manager under such terms and conditions as the City
Manager may reasonably prescribe, provided that such permission may not be
unreasonably or arbitrarily withheld.
Sec. 15-213.  Intentionally Left Blank
Sec. 15-214.  Installation of Meter
If a meter is to be installed in or near the Public Right-of-Way, Company
agrees to discuss with the Public Works Director or his or her delegate, the
aesthetics of the meter placement and to accommodate the request of City to the
maximum extent possible.  If City requests a meter upgrade, Company will comply
so long as City reimburses Company for the reasonable costs incurred by Company
in changing meters.  In no event, however, shall underground meters be
required.
Sec. 15-215.  Extensions for Customers   
 
   Company shall, at its expense, extend distribution mains in any street up to
fifty (50) feet for any one residential or commercial customer so long as the
customer at a minimum uses gas for unsupplemented space heating and water
heating.  Company shall not be required to extend transmission mains in any
Public Rights-of-Way within City or to make a tap on any transmission main
within City unless Company agrees to such extension by a written agreement
between Company and a customer.
 
Sec. 15-216.  Duty to Serve
Company hereby agrees that it will not arbitrarily refuse to provide service to
any Person having a service location within the City and meeting Company’s
reasonable credit requirements that it is economically feasible for Company to
serve.  In the event that a Person is refused service, said Person may request
a hearing before the City Council of City or its designee, said hearing to be
held within forty-five (45) days from the date of the request for hearing.  The
Council may order Company to provide service or take any other action necessary
to bring Company into compliance with the intent of the Council in granting
this Franchise, including termination or forfeiture of the Franchise in
accordance with Section 15-224.  The Council may render its opinion at this
meeting but in no event shall it be required to act in less than fourteen (14)
days.
Sec. 15-217.  Customer Service Standards; Local Office
 
   a.   Company shall maintain a local, toll-free or collect call telephone
access line which will be available to its customers 24 hours a day, seven days
a week. 
 
   b.   Company shall make a good faith effort to maintain within City one or
more locations where customers can pay their bills.  In no circumstance shall
the absence of such a location be considered violation of a material provision
of this Franchise as outlined in Section 15-224.
 
Sec. 15-218.  Rates.
   Company’s rates and charges shall be established and shall be subject to
revision and change in accordance with all applicable statutes and ordinances. 
Company shall maintain on file with City copies of its current tariffs,
schedules or rates and charges, customer service provisions, and line extension
policies. 
 
Sec. 15-219.  Payments to the City
a.   In consideration of the privilege and license granted by City to Company
to use and occupy the Public Rights-of-Way in the City for the conduct of its
business, Company, its successors and assigns, agrees to pay and City agrees to

equivalent to five percent (5%) of the quarterly Gross Revenues, as defined in

2012, based on the preceding calendar quarter (January 1, 2012 to March 31,
2012) and shall be for the right and privilege during the preceding calendar

203.b, the final payment under this Franchise will be due on or before February
15, 2023, and will be for the preceding calendar quarter (October 1, 2022 to

b.   The franchise fee amounts based on “Contributions in Aid of Construction”
(“CIAC”) shall be calculated on an annual calendar year basis, i.e., from
January 1 through December 31 of each calendar year.  The franchise fee amounts
that are due based on CIAC shall be paid at least once annually on or before
April 30 each year based on the total CIAC recorded during the preceding
calendar year.  The initial CIAC franchise fee payment will be due on or before
April 30, 2013 and will be based on CIAC received from January 1, 2012, through

and street or alley rentals or charges, and all other and additional municipal
taxes, charges, levies, fees, and rentals of whatsoever kind and character that
City may now impose or hereafter levy and collect from Company or Company’s

however, Company’s separate obligations to reimburse the City for City’s
reasonable rate case expenses and for street repairs in accordance with City’s
ordinances, are not affected by Company’s payment of franchise fees hereunder. 
Should City not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing
sums of money shall be in lieu of occupation taxes, licenses, fees, street or
alley rentals or charges, easements or franchise taxes or charges aforesaid,
then City agrees that it will apply so much of said sums of money paid as may
be necessary to satisfy Company’s obligations, if any, to pay any such
occupation taxes, licenses, charges, fees or rentals.
d.   If Company fails to pay when due any payment provided for in this Section,
Company shall pay such amount plus interest consistent with the rate for
customer deposits under Texas Utilities Code Section 183.003 from such due date
until payment is received by City.
   e.   City agrees that:  (i) as regulatory authority, it will adopt and
approve the ordinance, rates or tariff which provide for 100% recovery of such
franchise fees as part of Atmos’ rates; (ii) if the City intervenes in any
regulatory proceeding before a federal or state agency in which the recovery of
Atmos’ franchise fees is an issue, the City will take an affirmative position
supporting 100% recovery of such franchise fees by Atmos; (iii) in the event of
an appeal of any such regulatory proceeding in which the City has intervened,
the City will take an affirmative position in any such appeals in support of
the 100% recovery of such franchise fees by Atmos; and (iv) it will take no
action, nor cause any other person or entity to take any action, to prohibit
recovery of such franchise fees by Atmos.
 
   f.   Company shall have the right to lease, license or otherwise grant to a
party other than Company the use of its Facilities within the City’s Public
Right-of-Way provided: (i) Company first notifies City of the name of the
lessee, licensee or user, the type of service(s) intended to be provided
through the facilities, and the name and telephone number of a contact person
associated with such lessee, licensee or user; and (ii) Company makes the
franchise fee payment due on the revenues from such lease pursuant to Section
15-219 of this Ordinance.  This authority to lease Facilities within City’s
Public Right-of-Way shall not affect any such lessee, licensee or user’s
obligation, if any, to pay franchise fees, access line fees, or similar Public
Right-of-Way user fees.
 
   g.   City shall, within thirty (30) days of final approval, give Company
notice of annexations and disannexations of territory by City, which notice
shall include a map and addresses, if known.  Upon receipt of said notice,
Company shall  promptly initiate a process to reclassify affected customers
into the City limits no later than sixty (60) days after receipt of notice from
City.  The annexed areas added to the City limits will be included in future
franchise payments in accordance with the effective date of the annexation if
notice was timely received from City.  Upon request from City, Company will
provide documentation to verify that affected customers were appropriately
reclassified and included for purposes of calculating franchise payments.
 
Sec. 15-220.  Books and Records
   a.   Company agrees that at the time of each quarterly payment, Company
shall also submit to the City a statement showing its Gross Revenues for the
preceding calendar quarter as defined in Section 15-201.d.
 
b.   City may, if it sees fit, upon reasonable notice to the Company, have the
books and records of Company examined by a representative of said City to
ascertain the correctness of the reports agreed to be filed herein. Company
shall make available, during normal working hours and upon reasonable notice,
such personnel and records as City may in its reasonable discretion request in
order to complete such audit, and shall make no charge to the City therefor. 
Company shall assist City in its review by providing all requested information
no later than fifteen business (15) days after receipt of a request.  The cost
of the audit shall be borne by City unless the audit discloses that the Company
has underpaid the franchise fee by 10% or more, in which case the reasonable
costs of the audit shall be immediately reimbursed to the City by the Company. 
If such an examination reveals that Company has underpaid City, then upon
receipt of written notification from City regarding the existence of such
underpayment, Company shall undertake a review of City’s claim and if said
underpayment is confirmed, remit the amount of underpayment to City, including
any interest calculated in accordance with Section 15-219.d.  Should Company
determine through examination of its books and records that City has been
overpaid, upon receipt of written notification from Company regarding the
existence of such overpayment, City shall review Company’s claim and if said
overpayment is confirmed, remit the amount of overpayment to Company including
any interest calculated in accordance with Section 15-219.d.  The period of
review for purposes of determining overpayments or underpayments shall be
limited to payments made in the two (2) year period before commencement of the
audit.
Sec. 15-221.  Reservation of Rights: General
a.   City reserves to itself the right and power at all times to exercise, in
the interest of the public and in accordance with state law, regulation and
control of Company’s use of the Public Rights-of-Way to ensure the rendering of
efficient public service, and the maintenance of Company’s System in good
repair throughout the term of this Franchise.
b.   The rights, privileges, and franchises granted by this Ordinance are not
to be considered exclusive, and City hereby expressly reserves the right to
grant, at any time, like privileges, rights, and franchises as it may see fit
to any other person or corporation for the purpose of furnishing gas for light,
heat, and power and for City and the inhabitants thereof.
   c.   City expressly reserves the right to own and/or operate its own system
for the purpose of transporting, delivering, distributing, or selling gas to
and for the City.
 
   d.   Nothing herein shall impair the right of the City to fix, within
constitutional and statutory limits, a reasonable price to be charged for
natural gas, or to provide and fix a scale of prices for natural gas, and other
charges, to be charged by Company to residential consumers, commercial
consumers, industrial consumers, or to any combination of such consumers,
within the territorial limits of the City as same now exists or as such limits
may be extended from time to time hereafter.
 
Sec. 15-222.  Right to Indemnification and to be Held Harmless
a.    In consideration of the granting of this Franchise, Company agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless City, its officers, agents, and employees
(City and such other persons and entities being collectively referred to herein
as “Indemnitees”),from and against all suits, actions or claims of injury to
any person or persons, or damages to any property brought or made for or on
account of any death, injuries to, or damages received or sustained by any
person or persons or for damage to or loss of property arising out of, or
occasioned by Company’s intentional and/or negligent acts or omissions in
connection with Company’s operations; except that the indemnity provided for in
this paragraph shall not apply to the extent any liability is determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the negligence or
intentional acts or omissions of City, its officers, agents, and employees.  In
the event of joint and concurrent negligence or fault of both Company and City,
responsibility and indemnity, if any, shall be apportioned comparatively in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without, however, waiving any of
the defenses of the parties under Texas law.  Further, in the event of joint
and concurrent negligence or fault of both Company and City, responsibility for
all costs of defense shall be apportioned between City and Company based upon
the comparative fault of each.
b.   In fulfilling its obligation to defend and indemnify City, Company shall
have the right to select defense counsel, subject to City’s approval, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Company shall retain defense counsel
within seven (7) business days of City’s written notice that City is invoking
its right to indemnification under this Franchise.  If Company fails to retain
counsel within such time period, City shall have the right to retain defense
counsel on its own behalf, and Company shall be liable for all defense costs
incurred by City, except as set out in Section 15-222.a.
Sec. 15-223.  Insurance
Company will maintain an appropriate level of insurance and/or self-insurance
in consideration of Company’s obligations and risks undertaken pursuant to this
Franchise. To the extent Company’s insurance of its obligations and risks
undertaken pursuant to this Franchise is in the form of self-insurance then
such self-insurance must be permitted by applicable law and be administered by
Company under a plan of self-insurance maintained in accordance with sound
accounting and risk-management practices.  Upon request of City, Company will
furnish City with a letter evidencing such self-insurance signed by an
authorized representative of Company.  The Company will require its self-
insurance to respond to the same extent as if an insurance policy had been
purchased naming the City as an additional insured, and any excess coverage
purchased for the sole purpose of insuring Company’s obligations pursuant to
this agreement will name the City as an additional insured up to the amounts
required by City’s ordinance.
Sec. 15-224.  Termination
a.   Right to Terminate.  In addition to any rights set out elsewhere in this
Ordinance, City reserves the right to terminate the Franchise and all rights
and privileges pertaining thereto, in the event that Company violates any
material provision of the Franchise.
b.   Procedures for Termination.
1.   City may, at any time, terminate this Franchise for a continuing material
violation by Company of any of the substantial terms hereof.  In such event,
City shall give to Company written notice, specifying all grounds on which
termination or forfeiture is claimed, by registered mail, addressed and
delivered to Company at the address set forth in Section 15-208Nine 15-208(a)
hereof.  Company shall have sixty (60) days after the receipt of such notice
within which to cease such violation and comply with the terms and provisions
hereof.  In the event Company fails to cease such violation or otherwise comply
with the terms hereof, then Company’s Franchise is subject to termination under
the following provisions.  Provided, however, that if Company commences work or
other efforts to cure such violations within thirty (30) days after receipt of
written notice and shall thereafter prosecute such curative work with
reasonable diligence until such curative work is completed, then such
violations shall cease to exist, and the Franchise will not be terminated.
2.   Termination shall be declared only by written decision of the City Council
after an appropriate public proceeding whereby Company is afforded the full
opportunity to be heard and to respond to any such notice of violation or
failure to comply.  Company shall be provided at least fifteen business (15)
days prior written notice of any public hearing concerning the termination of
the Franchise.  In addition, ten (10) days notice by publication shall be given
of the date, time and place of any public hearing to interested members of the
public.
3.   City, after full public hearing, and upon finding material violation or
failure to comply, may terminate the Franchise or excuse the violation or
failure to comply, upon a showing by Company of mitigating circumstances or
upon a showing of good cause of said violation or failure to comply as may be
determined by the City Council.
4.   Nothing herein stated shall preclude Company from appealing the final
decision of the City Council to a court or regulatory authority having
jurisdiction. 
5.   Nothing herein stated shall prevent City from seeking to compel compliance
by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction if Company fails to comply with
the terms of this Franchise after due notice and the providing of adequate time
for Company to comply with said terms.
Sec. 15-225.  Renegotiation
If either City or Company requests renegotiation of any term of this Ordinance,
Company and City agree to renegotiate in good faith revisions to any and all
terms of this Ordinance.  If the parties cannot come to agreement upon any
provisions being renegotiated, then the existing provisions of this Ordinance
will continue in effect for the remaining term of the Franchise.
 
Sec. 15-226.  Effective Date
This Franchise shall be effective on January 1, 2012, if City has received
Company’s acceptance as provided by Section 15-203 herein.  The Company’s
obligation to submit payments to the City in compliance with Section 15-219
will begin January 1, 2012.
Sec. 15-227.  No Waiver
Either City or Company shall have the right to waive any requirement contained
in this Ordinance, which is intended for the waiving party’s benefit, but,
except as otherwise provided herein, such waiver shall be effective only if in
writing executed by the party for whose benefit such requirement is intended. 
No waiver of any breach or violation of any term of this Ordinance shall be
deemed or construed to constitute a waiver of any other breach or violation,
whether concurrent or subsequent, and whether of the same or a different type
of breach or violation.
Sec. 15-228.  Severability
This Ordinance and every provision hereof, shall be considered severable, and
the invalidity or unconstitutionality of any section, clause, provision, or
portion of this Ordinance shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of
any other portion of this Ordinance. If any term or provision of this Ordinance
is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity or
unenforceability of the remaining terms or provisions of this Ordinance shall
not be affected thereby.  (Ord. 0-2012-9, 2/9/12)

A Person is subject to reasonable police power regulation of the City to manage
its Public Rights-of-Way in connection with the excavation, construction,
installation, expansion, reconstruction, relocation, alteration, removal,
maintenance or repair of Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way, pursuant to
the City's rights as a custodian of public property based upon the City’s
historic rights under state and federal laws.  Such regulations include, but
are not limited to, the following:
   a.   At the City's request, a Person shall furnish the City Engineer
accurate and complete information relating to the excavation, construction,
installation, expansion, reconstruction, relocation, alteration, removal,
maintenance or repair of Facilities performed by the Person in the Public
Rights-of-Way.
   b.   A Person shall perform excavations and other construction in the Public
Rights-of-Way in accordance with all applicable City requirements.  The City
may  require use of trenchless  technology if it determines that, based upon
information provided to the City by the Person,  the particular field
conditions warrant the requirement.  All excavations and other construction in
the Public Rights-of-Way shall be conducted so as to  minimize interference
with the use of public and private property.  A Person shall follow all
reasonable construction directions given by the City in order to minimize any
such interference.
   c.   Underground installation which would cross a water main 18 inches and
larger will require open excavations.  State regulations on minimum overhead
line heights shall apply to all overhead line installations.
   d.   The City recognizes that Utility Companies use the City’s right-of-way
as a matter of necessity to provide citizens of the City with valuable
services.  The City does not intend to unnecessarily inhibit utilities from
installing facilities to provide valuable services.  However, a person must
obtain a permit, as reasonably required by applicable City codes, prior to any
excavation, construction, installation, expansion, reconstruction, relocation,
alteration, removal, maintenance or repair of the Person’s Facilities that
involves any of the following:
      1.   cuts the paved street surface; or
      2.   Overhead – a project impacting five or more existing and or new
poles/structures within the street Right of Way; or
      3.   Underground – Any project which impacts 3 or more pedestals,
transformers, underground vaults or other structures and involves more than 200
feet linear underground installation within the street Right of Way; or
      4.   blocks traffic lanes or sidewalks during peak traffic periods
between 7:00  a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, or for
more than three hours during any non-peak traffic period.
However, if the person has to obtain a federal or state permit for the work,
then only a copy of that permit need be provided to the City.
Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent harm to
property or Persons (“Emergency Conditions”), a Person may not excavate the
pavement of a street or Public Rights-of-Way without first complying with City
requirements. The City Engineer or designee shall be notified as promptly as
possible regarding work performed under such Emergency Conditions, and the
Person shall comply with the requirements of City standards and of this Article
for the restoration, replacement or repair of the Public Rights-of-Way.
A construction permit is not required for routine maintenance that does not
require a pavement cut or just involves connecting to existing  facilities for
service, provided the construction  does not include items number (1) – (4)
above of this subsection d.  Once a permit is issued, Person shall give to the
City a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours notice (which may be given at the time
of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of the above listed
activities on its Facilities in, on or under the Public Rights-of-Way.  The
failure of the Person to request and obtain a permit from the City prior to
performing any of the above listed activities in, on or over any Public Right-
of-Way, except in an emergency as provided for in Subsection (k) below, will
subject the Person to a stop-work order from the City and enforcement action. 
If the Person fails  to act upon any permit within 90 calendar days of
issuance, the permit shall become invalid unless extended by the City upon a
showing of good cause.  Upon expiration of a permit, a Person shall be required
to obtain another permit pursuant to the requirements of this Article.
   e.   A Person shall furnish the City with construction plans and maps
showing the location and proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction
at least five (5) business days before beginning construction or reconstruction
that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the Public Rights-
of-Way, unless otherwise approved by the City.  A Person may not begin
construction until the location of new Facilities and proposed routing of the
new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have
been approved in writing by the City, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative
locations for the Facilities and routing.
   f.   The City may require reasonable bonding requirements of a Person, as
are required of other entities that place Facilities in the Public Rights-of-
Way.  This requirement may be waived or modified by the City Engineer upon a
showing of good cause.
   g.   In determining whether any requirement under this Section is
unreasonable or unfeasible, the City Engineer  shall consider, among other
things, whether the requirement would subject the Person or Persons to an
unreasonable increase in risk or service interruption, or to an unreasonable
increase in liability for accidents, or to an unreasonable delay in
construction or in availability of its services, or to any other unreasonable
technical or economic burden.
   h.   A Person issued a permit pursuant to this Article shall, at all times,
employ the standard of care attendant to the risks involved to prevent actions,
failures and accidents which may cause damage, injury or nuisance to persons,
the public, the Facilities of other Persons, or to any City structures or
structures owned by other Persons located in the Public Rights-of-Way.  A
Person issued a permit pursuant to this Chapter shall observe all federal and
state statutes and regulations and all applicable City Ordinances and shall
keep and maintain its Facilities in a safe and suitable condition, and in good
order and repair.
   i.   Any person aggrieved by the denial of a permit under this Article may
appeal such action to the City Manager in accordance with the City Code.  (Ord.
No. 0-2017-20; 2/22/17)
   j.   Upon completion of excavation, construction, installation, expansion,
reconstruction, relocation, alteration, removal, maintenance or repair of
Facilities or other work in the Public Rights-of-Way, a Person shall promptly
restore and repair the Public Rights-of-Way in accordance with applicable City
requirements.  Within thirty (30) calendar days after completion of work in the
Public Rights-of-Way, the Person shall properly restore, replace, relay and/or
repair the surface, base, curbs, drainage systems, irrigation systems,
landscape treatment or City facilities and infrastructure located on, in or
under any Public Rights-of-Way that has been excavated, altered or damaged by
reason of the excavation, construction, installation, expansion,
reconstruction, relocation, alteration, removal, maintenance or repair of the
Person’s Facilities and shall return same to the same or better condition it
was in prior the work.  Upon a showing of good cause, the City may at its sole
discretion extend the time for restoration and repair of the Public Rights-of-
Way under this subsection.
   k.   Upon failure of a Person to perform any such repair or replacement
work, and five (5) days after written notice has been given by the City to the
Person, and in the event repairs have not been initiated during such five day
period, the City may repair such portion of the Public Rights-of-Way as may
have been disturbed by the Person, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of
an invoice from the City, the Person will reimburse the City for  the costs so
incurred within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the City invoice.
   l.   Should the City reasonably determine, within one year from the date of
the completion of the repair work, that the surface, base, curbs, drainage
systems, irrigation systems, landscape treatment or other City facilities and
infrastructure located on, in or under any Public Rights-of-Way requires
additional restoration, replacement or repair work to meet existing City
standards, a Person shall perform such additional work to the satisfaction of
the City, subject to all City remedies as provided herein.
   m.   Notwithstanding the foregoing in subsection g., if the City determines
that the failure of a Person to properly repair or restore the Public Rights-
of-Way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the City may undertake
emergency repairs and restoration efforts, after emergency notice has been
provided, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances, and the Person
failed to respond within a reasonable time specified by the City.  Upon receipt
of an invoice from the City, a Person shall promptly reimburse the City for all
costs incurred by the City within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of
the City invoice.
   n.   If the City Engineer declares an emergency with regard to the health
and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or
abatement of Facilities, a Person shall remove or abate the Person's Facilities
by the deadline provided in the City Engineer’s request.  The Person and the
City shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of service. 
If the Person, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the City may remove or
abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the Person, without paying
compensation to the Person and without the City incurring liability for
damages. In such situation, the City will take reasonable efforts to ensure
that any alterations to a system will not create operational problems that
could seriously impact customers of that system.
   o.   Within sixty (60) days of completion of each new permitted section of a
Person's Facilities:
      1.   If there were not changes, a letter or e-mail verifying it was built
according to Plan, or
      2.   If there were changes from the original drawings submitted, the
Person shall supply the City with a complete set of any changes for the segment
in a format used in the ordinary course of the Person’s business to the extent
they are prepared in the ordinary course of business, but excluding customer
specific, proprietary or confidential information and  as reasonably prescribed
by the City, and as allowed by law.  The City may, at its discretion, accept in
lieu of “as-built” drawings or changes, any reasonable alternative which
provides adequate information as to the location of Facilities in the Public
Rights-of-Way.  (Ord. No. 0-2002-59, 12/11/02)
Sec. 15-266.  Excavations.      (Moved from section 18-1.)
   Public utility cuts on streets.  Anyone cutting a City street shall notify
the City (Streets department) by facsimile by the next 8:00 a.m. after the cut
is made, if such cut is to repair existing infrastructure. Street cuts or

Sec. 15-267.  Conditions of Public Rights-of-Way Occupancy.
   a.   In the exercise of governmental functions, the City has first priority
over all other uses of the Public Rights-of-Way.  The City reserves the right
to lay sewer, gas, water facilities, and any other pipe lines or cables and
conduits, and to do underground and overhead work in, across, along, over or
under a public street, alley or Public Rights-of-Way occupied by a Person, and
to change the curb,  route or grade of sidewalks and streets.
   b.   The City shall assign the location in or over the Public Rights-of-Way
among competing users of the Public Rights-of-Way with due consideration to the
public health and safety considerations  of each user type, and to the extent
the City can demonstrate that there is limited space available for additional
users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law.
   c.   If the City authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the
surface of any public street, alley, or Public Rights-of-Way, the grant to an
abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the previously authorized
user of the Public Rights-of-Way.  If the City closes or abandons a Public
Right-of-Way that contains a portion of a Person's Facilities, the City shall
close or abandon such Public Right-of-Way subject to the rights of the Person.
   d.   If the City gives written notice, a Person shall, at its own expense,
temporarily or permanently, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of a
Person's Facilities that are in the Public Rights-of-Way within 120 days,
except in circumstances that require additional time as reasonably determined
by the City based upon information provided by the Person. For projects
expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, relocate, change or alter, the
City will confer with the Person before determining the alterations to be
required and the timing thereof.  The City shall give notice whenever the City
has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation
of a City governmental public improvement in the Public Rights-of-Way.  This
section shall not be construed to prevent a Person's recovery of the cost of
relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for
relocation or removal, nor shall it be required if improvements are solely for
beautification purposes without prior joint deliberation and agreement with the
Person.
   e.   If the Person fails to relocate Facilities in the time allowed in this
Section, the Person may be subject to liability to the City for such delay and
as set forth in the City Code, now or hereafter enacted.
   f.   Notwithstanding anything in Subsection d., the City Engineer and a
Person may agree in writing to different time frames than those provided above
if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change.
 1    g.   A Person may trim trees or other vegetation in or over the Public
Rights-of-Way as needed for the safe and reliable operation, use and
maintenance of its Facilities.  All tree trimming shall be performed in
accordance with City standards.  Should the Person, its contractor or agent,
fail to remove such trimmings within twenty-four (24) hours , the City may
remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of an invoice  from
the City, the Person shall promptly reimburse the City for all costs incurred
within thirty (30) working days.  A Person shall not be responsible for tree
trimming or removal, except as to the trimming required to construct, maintain
or restore utility service.  A person may ask the City for special
consideration during times of unusually large trimming activities due to
weather related situations.    (Ord. No. 0-2002-59, 12/11/02)
 
Notes
  The reference to "24 hours removal" should be interpreted that something is
  done within that time-either removal or call City and let City know that
1 company overwhelmed and may take longer.
  City will help out due to "weather related" when it is an emergency (defined
  by City activating the EOC) or upon request from the company and if Mayor/
  Council agree with Company.
Sec. 15-268.  Insurance Requirements.
   a.   A Person shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts reasonably
prescribed  by the City with an insurance company licensed to do business in
the State of Texas acceptable to the City.  A Person shall furnish the City
Engineer with proof of insurance at the time of the request for construction
permits.  The City reserves the right to review the insurance requirements and
to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the City Engineer
determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims
history of the industry or the Person require adjustment of the coverage.  For
purposes of this section, the City will accept certificates of self-insurance
issued by the State of Texas or letters written by the Person in those
instances where the State does not issue such letters, which provide the same
coverage as required herein.  However, for the City to accept such letters the
Person must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial
resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the City,
based on financial information requested by and furnished to the City.  The
City’s current insurance requirements are available from either the City
Engineer or City Attorney.
   b.   A Person shall furnish to the City Engineer, at no cost to the City,
copies of certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required by this
Section.  The City may request the deletion, revision or modification of
particular policy terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions, unless the
policy provisions are established by a law or regulation binding the City, the
Person, or the underwriter.  If the City requests a deletion, revision or
modification, a Person shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to
accomplish the change.
   c.   The insurance certificate required under subsection b. shall:
      1.   name the City and its past and present officers, employees, board
members and elected representatives as additional insureds for all applicable
coverage;
      2.   provide for 30 days notice to the City for cancellation, non-
renewal, or material change; and
      3.   provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the City Engineer
by certified mail, or by fax or e-mail so long as Person can verify City
received notice.
      4.   provide a waiver of subrogation
   d.   A Person shall immediately advise the City Attorney of actual or
potential litigation that may develop and/or  affect an existing carrier's
obligation to defend and indemnify.
   e.   An insurer has no right of indemnification nor recovery against the
City.  The required insurance policies shall protect the Person and the City. 
The insurance shall be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies.
   f.   The policy clause "Other Insurance" shall not apply to the City if the
City is an insured under the policy.
   g.   A Person shall pay premiums and assessments for the insurance required
under this section.  A company which issues an insurance policy has no recourse
against the City for payment of a premium or assessment.  Insurance policies
obtained by a Person must provide that the issuing company waives all right of
recovery by way of subrogation  and/or indemnity against the City in connection
with damage covered by the policy.    (Ord. No. 0-2002-59, 12/11/02)
Sec. 15-269.  Indemnity.
   a.   Except as to Certificated Telecommunications Providers, each Person
placing Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way shall agree to promptly defend,
indemnify and hold the City harmless from and against all damages, costs,
losses, expenses, and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and other
related costs, (i) for the repair, replacement, or restoration of City's
property, equipment, materials, structures and Facilities which are damaged,
destroyed or found  to be defective as a result of the Person's acts or
omission; (ii) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of
action, and judgments for (a) damage to or loss of the property of any Person

or (b) death, bodily injury, illness, disease, loss of services, or loss of
income or wages to any Person (including, but not limited to the agents,

third parties), arising out of, incident to, concerning or resulting from the
negligent or willful act or omissions of the Person, its agents, employees,
and/or subcontractors, in the performance of activities pursuant to or
authorized under this Article.
   b.   This indemnity provision shall not apply to any liability resulting
from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, agents, contractors,
or subcontractors.
   c.   The provisions of this indemnity are solely for the benefit of the City
and  are not intended to create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise,
to any other Person or entity.  (Ord. No. 0-2002-59, 12/11/02)
Sec. 15-270. Unauthorized Use of Public Rights-of-Way
   A conviction for violating a provision of this Article is punishable by a
fine of up to two thousand dollars ($2000.00) pursuant to State law and 
Section

the request to the City Council for approval.
   c.   Easements that are permanent in nature shall require approval of the
City Council prior to issuance.

subsection h. or i., which shall be in addition to the right-of-way use
easement fee in subsection e.2. of this Section. However, applications for
closures within the DBAC shall instead require a fee of $250 per day, or $100
per day if the applicant is a DBAC business, for the City's costs associated

of adequate clean-up of the closure area and areas adjacent to the closure
boundaries.
   f.   Any person aggrieved by the granting, or denial or other action
regarding an application under this Section may appeal the action within ten
(10) calendar days from the date of action in accordance with

natural flow and/or function of vehicular traffic for a social event, parade,
fund raiser, athletic event or similar event must apply to the Police
Department at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to closure. A Temporary
Street or Lane Closure Application can be obtained from and filed with the

occur in the Downtown Tyler Business, Arts. And Culture District (DBAC), then
said application shall first be filed with the Main Street Director.  Following
review by the Main Street Director, the application for DBAC shall then be
forwarded to the Police Department.  Using the Standards set forth in
subsection j., the Main Street Director has the right to limit the amount of
closures in the DBAC per month.
Except for block parties and/or street closures within the DBAC, there shall be
a fee of $75.00 for the City's costs associated with such Temporary Street or

ARTICLE V. STOPPING, STANDING OR PARKING
Sec. 17-80.  Parking designations; authority to install.
   a.   The Traffic Engineer shall study the needs of the public for parking
vehicles on public streets, the width and length of such streets where parking
is desired, the availability of parking space and frequency of parking on the
public street, and the needs of business and commercial establishments to have
regulated parking on those streets.  After making such studies, the Traffic
Engineer shall designate those areas where parking, stopping, or standing
should be allowed or banned and shall such by means of appropriate signs, by
installing parking meters, or by marking curbs giving notice that parking,
stopping, or standing is allowed or banned and for what period of time. 
Additionally, the Traffic Engineer shall determine when parking, stopping or
standing motor vehicles should be prohibited and shall regulate such
prohibition by installing appropriate signs, providing individual signs or
information on each parking meter so affected, or by marking curbs giving
notice that parking, stopping or standing is prohibited. The Traffic Engineer
shall make changes in parking regulations from time to time as required by
studies and investigations.  The Traffic Engineer shall also keep accurate and
current records of all parking designations, prohibitions, and sign
installations.

the vehicle unsafe to operate or inoperative.  However, no vehicle may be left
in a no parking area longer than necessary to effect repairs or to remove the
vehicle from the streets if it is impossible to effectuate repairs.  (The fact
that the hood of the vehicle is not raised shall, however, be prima facie
evidence that the vehicle was not having mechanical problems which rendered it
inoperative or unsafe).
   k.   All fire lanes shall be designated as such by the Fire Marshal pursuant
to Section
17-33.  A person commits an offense if without  authority from the Fire
Marshal, he or she places, maintains, or displays upon or in view of the public

and maintain appropriate signs indicating these locations. Unless different
effective hours are designated by the Traffic Engineer, freight loading zones
shall be effective between 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. except Sundays and meter

Engineer to be in charge of enforcing City parking ordinances  and then only
for a period necessary to complete one's undertaking.
   d.   The use of curb loading zones by passenger vehicles. A person may
stand, stop or park a passenger type vehicle in a freight loading zone for the
purpose of loading, unloading, delivery or pickup of freight if the person
places an appropriate sign at least six (6) inches by eleven (11) inches on the
windshield advising that the vehicle is parked for the purpose of loading,
unloading, delivery or pickup of freight. Absence of an appropriate sign on the
windshield of a passenger-type vehicle in a freight loading zone shall be prima
facie evidence that the vehicle is illegally parked. In no case shall this
passenger vehicle, however, be allowed to stop in said loading zone for said
purpose longer than fifteen (15) minutes except on written permission from the
person designated by the Traffic Engineer to be in charge of enforcing the City
parking ordinances and then only for a period necessary to complete one's
undertaking.
   e.   Authority to designate public carrier stands. The Traffic Engineer,
based upon engineering and traffic surveys, is authorized and required to

motor vehicles on public streets in such places determined to be of the
greatest benefit and convenience to the public, and every bus stop, taxicab
stand and other stand shall be designated by appropriate signs.
   f.   Parking of buses, taxicabs; regulating. The operator of a bus or
taxicab shall not stop, stand, or park upon a street in a business district at
any place other than a bus stop or taxicab stand, respectively, except that
this provision shall not prevent the driver of buses or taxicabs from
temporarily stopping in accordance with other stopping or parking regulations
at any other place for the purpose of loading or unloading passengers.
   g.   Restriction on the use of bus stops and taxicab stands.  It is an
offense to stop, stand or park a vehicle other than a bus in a bus stop zone or
other than a taxicab at a taxicab stand when the stop zone or stand has been
appropriately designated by signs, except the driver of a passenger vehicle may
temporarily stop therein while actually engaged in the loading or unloading of
passengers when stopping does not interfere with a bus or taxicab about to

of storage; and
      2.   That the owner of such is the person who unlawfully placed, left,
stopped, or parked the same in violation of this section.
      3.   When a police officer finds an automobile, vehicle, motor home,
recreational vehicle, machinery, trailer, implement, or other apparatus in

   d.   Deposit of coins required; parking meter fees.
         1. During the period when the parking time limit is in effect and the
deposit of an appropriate coin in the parking meter is required, the owner,

the period of time shown by the indicator on the calibrated dial of the meter.
         2. Parking meter fees.  Except as otherwise established in the Tyler
City Code, a parking meter fee of $1.00 per hour with an initial two-hour limit

for that part of the street where the meter is located, and such overparking
shall be unlawful.
   f.   Parking adjacent to expired meter. During the period when the time
limit is in effect and the deposit of an appropriate coin in the parking meter
is required, a person shall not permit a vehicle under his or her control to
remain in any parking space which is alongside of or next to a parking meter
when such meter is displaying a signal indicating illegal parking.
   g.   Deposit to extend parking time beyond maximum legal time prohibited. 
It is an offense to deposit or cause to be deposited in a parking meter, a coin

25/14)
   k.   Separate offense. Once a vehicle has been ticketed for being parked at

and the time and date of the illegal parking and issue in writing, on a City
form, notice to answer the charge of illegal parking within five (5) days,
during the hours and at the place specified in the notice.  Each additional
period of time the vehicle remains parked at the meter in excess of the parking

issued another citation or such vehicle shall be removed from the streets and
impounded as provided in Section
4-8.
   m.   Evidence overparking. When a vehicle remains parked in a parking stall
with a parking meter after the first violation for a period of time in excess
of the parking meter time limit, proof that the vehicle was parked in the same
parking space when the previous ticket was issued and that it remained parked
in that parking space in excess of the parking meter time limit shall
constitute prima facie evidence that the vehicle was parked for a continuous
period of time in excess of the parking meter time limit in said space and is a
violation of this section.
   n.   Hours effective. This section shall be in effect between the hours of
8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. every day except Saturdays and Sundays and the City

2016-77; 8/24/16)
   o.   Exceptions for persons with disabilities and veterans with
disabilities.  The parking restrictions in subsections a., d., e., f., g., k.,
l., and m., of this Section shall not apply to:
      1.   a vehicle properly displaying special license plates issued under
Texas Transportation Code Section 504.201 or successor, or properly displaying
a disabled parking placard issued under Texas Transportation Code Section
681.002 or successor, if the vehicle is being operated by or is being used for
the transportation of a  person with a disability.
      2.   a vehicle properly displaying disabled veteran license plates issued
under Texas Transportation Code Section 504.202 or successor, if the vehicle is
being operated by the person who registered the vehicle or by an organization
transporting veterans with a disability without charge. (Ord. No. 0-2004-65, 8/
25/04) (Ord. No. 0-2014-53; 6/25/14)
Sec. 17-85.   Free parking for certain periods of time.
   a.   Authority, covering meter.  The Traffic Engineer on the basis of
engineering and traffic surveys is authorized to determine locations where free
parking shall be permitted for specified periods of time. These signs may
include parking spaces in front of which is located a parking meter which has
been covered.  Said meter cover must clearly designate the area as free parking
for a specified period of time, after which time it is a violation, and it is a
separate offense if the vehicle remains parked for an additional time period,
that the vehicle will be towed away or another citation shall be issued.
   b.   No need for coin deposits.  When any parking space is designated as
free parking for a specified period of time, the vehicle operator may enter
said parking space and remain for a continuous period of time, not to exceed
the time limit clearly specified, without placing money in any meter.
   c.   Violation.  If a vehicle remains  parked in a parking space beyond the
time limit that is indicated, such vehicle shall be considered as parked
overtime beyond the time permitted in such space. The parking of a vehicle
overtime or beyond the time limit permitted where any such parking space is
located is a violation. If the vehicle remains parked in the same parking space
for an additional period of time in excess of the time limit which is clearly
posted or marked, it is a new and separate offense.
   d.   Person who commits a violation. It is unlawful for any person to cause
or allow a vehicle operated by such person to remain or be placed in any
parking space covered by this section for a continuous period of time exceeding
the posted time limit, and a separate violation if such person permits the
vehicle to remain for an additional period beyond the posted time limit.
   e.   Effect of proof of covering. When a person is charged with violating
this section, proof that a parking meter has been covered or otherwise
designated as free parking area shall constitute prima facie evidence that the
parking was authorized.
   f.   Presumption vehicle there for continuous periods of time. When a person
is charged with violating this section, proof that the vehicle was in the same
parking space at the beginning and expiration of the time period shall
constitute prima facie evidence that the vehicle was parked for a continuous
period of time in excess of the time limit in said space and is in violation of
this section
   g.   Citations. A police officer, parking patrol or other person authorized
by the City Council issuing citations for violation of this section shall
record the vehicle's state license number, make of the vehicle, the time, date
and place of the illegal parking, the number of covered meter, if one is
present, and issue in writing, on a City form, notice to answer the charge of
illegal parking within five (5) days during the hours and at the place
specified in the notice. After notice has been issued, when a vehicle remains
illegally parked for an additional period of time in excess of the parking time
limit indicated at such location, it shall be issued another citation or such
vehicle shall be removed from the streets and impounded as provided in section
4-8.  (Ord. 0-98-43, 5/27/98)
Sec. 17-86.   Penalties for illegal parking.
   a.   Unattended vehicles presumed left by owner. When a vehicle is left
unattended or unoccupied in violation of this Chapter it shall be presumed the
owner unlawfully stopped and placed or parked the vehicle.
   b.   Illegally stopped vehicles may be required to be moved. When a police
officer or other persons authorized by the City Council to enforce parking laws
finds a vehicle standing upon a street or highway in violation of this article,
the officer or authorized person is authorized to move the vehicle, or require
the driver or other person in charge of the vehicle to move the vehicle to a
location off the paved or main part of the highway or street.
(Ord. 0-98-43, 5/27/98)
Sec. 17-87.  Immobilization of vehicles.
   a.   The City Marshal, the City Marshal's deputies, Municipal Court
bailiffs, or any police officer is authorized to immobilize or cause the
immobilization of any vehicle for which one (1) or more parking citations have

ARTICLE V.  PRIVATE SWIMMING POOLS AND SPAS.
Sec.  18-50.  Maintenance of private swimming pools and spas.
   a.    Purpose.  Private swimming pools and spas can constitute attractive
nuisances to children, and appropriate safeguards are needed to prevent any
human being or animal from falling into or otherwise having access to such. 
Private swimming pools and spas can also become infested or inhabited by
rodents, vermin, snakes or other wild animals.  It is important to eliminate or
reduce standing or stagnant water, which can be a breeding ground for
mosquitoes and which can serve as a medium for transmission of disease.  The
clarity of water in a private swimming pool or spa can affect the ability to
inspect and determine whether human beings or animals have fallen in, there is
an infestation of animals or insects, whether there has been an accumulation of
unsanitary matter, and/or whether the structural integrity of the pool or spa
has been compromised or if there is leakage. Any person who operates a private
swimming pool or spa within the City limits shall maintain said pool or spa in
accordance with the requirements of this Article.  This Article shall be
liberally construed and applied to promote the underlying purpose of protecting
the public health and safety. 
   b.    Definitions.
For purposes of this Article, the following definitions shall apply.
Private spa shall mean a spa designed for recreational or therapeutic use
located on private single-family residential property under the control of a
property owner or legal occupancy.  The use of such spa is limited to members
of the owner’s or occupant’s family and invited guests.
Private swimming pool shall mean any swimming pool located on private single-
family residential property under the control of a property owner or legal
occupant.  The use of such pool is limited to members of the owner’s or
occupant’s family and invited guests.
Spa shall mean a small body of water, manmade, which is exclusively designed
for or used in conjunction with high velocity air and/or high velocity water
recirculation systems utilizing hot, cold or ambient temperature water.  Said
term shall include jacuzzis, hot tubs, whirlpools, and similar structures.
Swimming pool shall mean any manmade structure, basin, chamber or tank
containing any amount of water and designed for or used for swimming, diving,
wading, physical fitness or recreational bathing or use.  A spa is a swimming
pool.
   c.    Standards.  Any private swimming pool or spa located within the City,
and regardless of its actual use, shall remain in a condition so as not to
create a public health or safety hazard, or a nuisance to the general public. 
Any time that a private swimming pool or spa contains any amount of water, the
owner or occupant of the premises shall:
          1.     Maintain water clarity so that the bottom can be seen.
          2.     Maintain the pool or spa free from all foreign matter, garbage
or debris.
          3.     Prevent harborage or breeding places for insects, snakes,
rodents, vermin or other animals.

6-14.
          5.     Maintain gates and doors in accordance with City Code Section
6-14.

   d.    Public nuisance.  Any private swimming pool or spa located within the
City that fails to meet any of the requirements of subsection c. of this
section is hereby declared to be an unlawful public nuisance that is a threat
to the public health and safety.    Any time that a private swimming pool or
spa is abandoned, neglected, inoperable or is no longer being used for swimming
or recreational use, and such pool or spa otherwise fails to meet any of the
requirements of subsection c. of this section, such pool or spa is hereby
declared to be an unlawful public nuisance that is a threat to the public
health and safety. 
   e.    Inspections; enforcement. Code Enforcement personnel are authorized to
perform inspections of premises and to enforce the provisions of this Article.
   f.    Penalty. Violation of this Article is unlawful and shall subject the
violator to the penalties set forth in Section 1-4.  (Ord. No. 0-2009-112; 10/
28/09)
Sec. 18-51. Notice to property owners required when City seeks to assess
expenses; future violations within one year.
   a.   When a violation of this Article is found to exist and the City wishes
to assess expenses and/or obtain a lien against the property on which
corrective work by the City is performed, notice shall be given as set forth in

   c.   The developer of a platted subdivision shall advance the cost of
construction or extension under the following terms:
      1.   The developer shall present to the Director a minimum of six (6)
complete sets of detailed water and sanitary sewer construction plans,
specifications, and contract documents; prepared, signed and sealed by a
registered professional engineer. The subdivision and platting of the property

11/09)
Sec. 19-11. City participation in certain projects.
   a.   It is the policy of the City to plan water and sewer extensions for
efficient future use. In some cases the most efficient way to provide service
to an area involves the use of oversized lines or sewage lift stations. If a
development is proposed in a location in which the master plan for utilities
provides that oversized lines or sewage lift stations should be used, the
Director may require installation of such lines or lift stations. When
oversized lines are required, the developer shall pay the costs of providing
service to the development and, subject to availability of funds, the City will
pay the cost of increasing the line size to the size required. In the case of
lift stations, the City may also pay the cost of capacity in excess of that
required to serve the development, subject to the availability of funds.
   b.   The construction of sanitary sewage lift stations and pressure lines
will generally not be permitted unless it is impossible to connect to a gravity
system. If a lift station and pressure line is required, complete design,
including site work, all weather access, etc., shall be included in the plans
and specifications. Lift stations shall be designed in accordance with current
state and federal requirements and shall have either dual electrical power
supply or stand-by generator. The minimum lift station capacity shall be one
hundred (100) gallons per minute and shall have at least two (2) pumps, each of
which shall be capable of pumping the design capacity of the lift station. The
minimum pressure line size is four (4) inch diameter. The cost of lift station,
force main and appurtenances shall be borne by the developer.  The only portion
of lift station, force mains and appurtenances eligible for refund by the City
are associated oversizing costs approved by the Director.
   c.   When the development is to be served by an existing lift station in
which the City has contributed the cost to provide excess capacity, the
developer shall pay a pro rata cost of that station. The pro rata cost of the
station includes land, pumps, motors, building or structure, force main,
engineering, inspection, and any other applicable costs. This cost shall be
divided by the number of gross acres served to arrive at a cost per acre. The
developer shall pay this charge based on the number of gross acres in the
subdivision served by that lift station.
   d.   Any agreement on behalf of the City to pay part of the cost of
oversized lines or lift stations shall:
      1.   be in writing;
      2.   incorporate the policies of this section;
      3.   be approved by the Director; and
      4.   be subject to the availability of funds.
(Ord. No. O-96-54, 6-26-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-80, 10/20/99) (Ord. No. 2009-7, 2/
11/09)
Sec. 19-12. Reimbursements for part of water and sewer improvements.
   a.   Any subdivision or development on land existing in the City for a
minimum of one (1) year in which the owner or developer is required to advance
the cost of water or sewer improvements under Section
19-10 c. will be covered by contract. The contract will provide that the owner
or developer shall deposit with City the cost of construction of said water or
sewer improvements as determined by competitive bid or as estimated by the
Director plus five percent (5%). The contract shall provide that City shall
reimburse the developer for part of the money advanced (exclusive of lift
station, force mains and water or sewer services) for eligible cost of water or
sewer main extensions when service connections are made to the lines (during
the period of five (5) years following the date of the contract).
   b.   The developer is eligible for the maximum reimbursement when the number
of connections made to the extended lines during the five-year period equals or
exceeds the number of feet of constructed lines divided by one hundred (100).
For example, if one thousand (1,000) feet of line were constructed in
accordance with the refund contract, at least ten (10) lots must be connected
in order to entitle the developer to a maximum refund. If there is less than
one lot for each unit of one hundred (100) feet of line, then the total
eligible refund shall be reduced proportionately. In the example above, if only
nine (9) lots had been connected, the eligible reimbursement would be nine-
tenths (9/10) of maximum. In calculating the number of lots connected to the
extended lines, credit is given for lots connected to the extended lines which
are owned by persons who are not parties to the reimbursement contract as well
as those owned by the developer.
   c.   The total amount advanced, the total length of line, and number and
description of lots to be developed and the eligible refund per lot shall be
made a part of the contract. City will, three (3) years from date of contract,
determine the number of lots that have been developed through the first three
(3) years of contract. This number multiplied by the amount to be reimbursed
for each lot will determine the amount of the earned refund to be returned as a
result of the first three (3) years development.
   d.   City shall refund to the developer the fixed amount for each lot
developed and connected to City water and sewer lines. The refund payments will
become due and payable at the end of each year beginning three (3) years from
date of contract. The payment will be over a period of five (5) years. The
first payment will be for one-fifth (1/5) of the earned refund, and shall be
due and payable three (3) years from date of contract. The second, third,
fourth, and fifth payments shall become due four (4), five (5), six (6), and
seven (7) years, respectively, from the date of contract. One-fifth (1/5) of
the refund earned during the fourth and fifth years of the contract, shall

to pay the state mandated Water Service Fee and the state mandated Water
Service Fee, charged the City by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(or its assigns and successors) for the annual inspection of the water system
and the sanitary sewer system. This surcharge shall be based on the pro-rated
cost of the total fee applicable to each account. (Ord. 0-2010-24, 3/24/10)
(Ord. No. O-2016-78; 9/14/2016)
Sec. 19-63. Billing; delinquency; reconnection charge.
   a.   Meters shall be read monthly and the consumer billed with a statement
showing the amount due to City for the amount of water used up to the date the
meter is read. The bill shall show the due date. If the bill is not paid when
due, City shall have the right to turn off or disconnect the water service and/
or disconnect sewer service. The same shall not be restored or turned on until
such time as the full amount due and owing the City for delinquent water and
sewer service is paid together with a fee to cover the cost of disconnecting
and restoring such service.
   b.   If it becomes necessary to disconnect sewer service, the Director shall
cause an itemized statement to be prepared for actual cost of disconnection and
an estimate for reconnection to such service, and such actual and estimated
costs shall be paid prior to restoration of service. If the estimate of cost
differs from the actual cost for restoring service, an adjustment will be made
in the customer's billing. However, the Director shall provide the customer an
opportunity for a hearing prior to discontinuance of service to show cause as
to why such service should not be discontinued.
   c.   If any consumer becomes indebted to the City for service at a previous
place of consumption, service at the consumer’s current place of service shall
be discontinued by the City until payment in full, plus any service charges, is
made.
   d.   No plumber or any other person may open the street curb stop after same
has been closed by the Division without a written permit first being obtained
from the Director.  (Ord. No. O-96-54, 6-26-96) (Ord. No. 0-99- 70, 10-1-99)
(Ord. No. 2009-7, 2/11/09)
Sec. 19-64. Sewer service rates.
   a.   The following rates per month shall be charged for sanitary sewer
service furnished to the users or customers receiving City sanitary sewer
services. In calculating the monthly service charge, the rates shall be applied
to the volume of water used as measured by the consumer's water meter, except
that water usage subject to charges for sanitary sewer service to single-family
residences, duplexes, apartment houses, townhouses, condominiums, and mobile
home parks shall not exceed ten thousand (10,000) gallons per single-family
residential unit monthly. Rates to commercial, governmental and institutional
customers will be based on monthly water use subject to customer proof of lower
sewage discharged. If the customer is not supplied water by City, the volume of
water used shall be determined by metering or measuring devices acceptable to
the Division.

25/19)
   b.   Activation fee. The tap fee shall include the cost of a tap and service
connection from the main to the property line when the total length is fifty
(50) feet or less and when installation is not by boring or tunneling under a
street or other structure. In such cases the cost of tap and service shall be
the actual cost of furnishing and installing the tap and service line plus a
factor of 1.25 to cover overhead and administrative cost. Sewer services six
(6) inches and larger will require an approved manhole at the junction with the
main. The charge for six (6) inch and larger service connection will be the
actual cost of construction including labor, equipment, materials and street
restoration, times a factor of 1.25 to cover overhead and administrative costs.
By permission of the Director, sewer services six (6) inches and larger may be
constructed by an approved contractor. It is the responsibility of the property
owner to maintain the sewer service from the sewer main to and on owners'
property, including the connection to the sewer main. In addition to the sewer
tap fee, there shall be payable in advance a sewer activation fee. The
following fees shall be charged:
 
Size of Service   Charge
4-inch            $26.50   
6-inch and larger $26.50
   The Director may allow the construction of a single service connection to
service two properties using a “y” at the joint property line.  The Division
shall be responsible for maintenance of that portion of service line extending
from the main to the “y” located at the joint property line.(Ord. No. O-96-54,
6-26-96) (Ord. No. 0-99- 70, 10-1-99) (Ord 0-2003-42, 9-10-2003) (0-2008-128;

   c.   If an industrial user is not connected to the city water system, the
minimum charge will be calculated on water system size. The rates charged will
be equivalent to the rates charged for metered systems of the same size.
   d.   If any of the concentrations set forth in the industrial waste
ordinance are exceeded, such as, but not limited to chemical oxygen demand
(COD) and total suspended solids (TSS), the industrial customer will pay a
surcharge in accordance with the preceding extra strength surcharge rates, or
as transportation and/or treatment costs may warrant for any other pollutants.
Only in exceptional cases will pollutants in excess of permitted parameters be
accepted.
   e.   Industrial rates (I.R.) can thus be calculated by either of two (2)
equations:
      1.   Volume of water used (under 1,000,000 gallons based on a seventy
(70) percent return factor):
      I.R. = Mw + (Rate per 1,000 gals.) (Vw - 2) + [(COD Surcharge)(COD-300) +
(TSS Surcharge) (TSS-250)] Vw
      2.   Volume of sewage discharged (under 1,000,000 gallons):
      I.R. = Ms + (Rate per 1,000 gals.)(Vs-2) + [(COD Surcharge)(COD-300) +
(TSS Surcharge) (TSS-250]Vs where:
      Mw   =   The minimum rate for sewer utility use based on the size of
water meter.
      Ms   =   The minimum rate for sewer utility use based on the size of
water meter, or on the water meter size equivalent.
      Vw   =   The total volume of water used during the month (in thousands of
gallons).
      Vs   =   The total volume of sewage discharged during the month (in
thousands of gallons).
      COD   =   The established chemical oxygen demand strength of the
industrial waste discharged, based on laboratory analyses, and expressed in
milligrams per liter (mg/l).
      TSS   =   The established total suspended solids concentration of the
industrial waste discharged, based on laboratory analyses, and expressed in
milligrams per liter (mg/l).
      250   =   The surcharge limit for TSS established in the industrial waste
ordinance, expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/l).
      300   =   The surcharge limit for COD established in the industrial waste
ordinance, expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/l).
   f.   Rates for services to industrial waste dischargers outside the city
limits shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.5. (Ord. No. O-96-54, 6-26-96)
(Ord. No. 0-98-74, 9/2/98) (Ord. No. 0-99- 70, 10-1-99)
Sec. 19-67. Storm Water/Drainage Surcharge.
   a.   Establishment of storm water/drainage surcharge.
      1.   Upon each developed lot or parcel with structural improvement that

      2.   The total amount of the monthly six percent (6%) surcharge imposed
upon residential property pursuant to this Section shall be subject to a
maximum charge of $25.00 per month ($300.00 per year). The total amount of the
monthly six percent (6%) surcharge imposed upon commercial property pursuant to
this Section shall be subject to a maximum charge of $208.33 per month ($2,500
per year).
   b.   Definitions.  The following definitions shall apply to this Section:
      1.   Residential property shall mean any property platted, zoned or used
for residential purposes, and having an actual account established for water,
sewer and/or irrigation services.
      2.   Commercial property shall mean a developed lot or parcel used for
commercial, industrial, institutional, or property otherwise not falling within

   a.   Purpose and policy. This division sets forth uniform requirements for
users of the wastewater collection system and publicly owned treatment works
(POTW) for the City and enables the City to comply with all applicable State
and Federal laws including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), and
the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this
division are:
      1.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with the operation of the POTW;
      2.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will
pass through the POTW inadequately treated, into the receiving waters or
otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;
      3.   To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge
is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations;
      4.   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and
sludge in the course of their employment, and to protect the general public;
      5.   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the POTW;
      6.   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW; and
      7.   To enable the City to comply with its NPDES permit conditions,
sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other Federal or State laws to
which the POTW is subject.
   This division shall apply to all industrial users of the POTW. The division
authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring,
compliance and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review
procedures; requires industrial user reporting; and provides for the setting of
fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program
established herein.

Sec. 19-73. General sewer use requirements
   a.   Prohibited discharge standards. No industrial user shall introduce or
cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes
pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all
industrial users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical
pretreatment standards or any other federal, state, or local pretreatment
standards or requirements. Wastes prohibited by this section shall not be
processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW,
except that any floor drains connected to the POTW located in a process or
material storage area may be allowed by the Manager provided proper controls
are in place. No industrial user may contribute the following substances to the
POTW:
      1.   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the municipal
wastewater collection system and POTW, including, but not limited to,
wastestreams with a closed-cup flash point of less than one hundred forty (140)
degrees Fahrenheit (60º C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
      2.   Any wastewater having a pH less than five (5.0) or more than eleven
and five-tenths (11.5), or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the
POTW or equipment, or endangering City personnel.
      3.   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction
of the flow to or within the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case
solids greater than five-tenths (0.5) inch in any dimension.
      4.   Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen demanding
pollutants (BOD5, COD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or
pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause pass through or interference with the POTW or any
wastewater treatment or sludge process; or which will constitute a hazard to
human or animal life.
      5.   Any wastewater having a temperature greater than one hundred fifty
(150) degrees Fahrenheit (65° C), or which will inhibit biological activity in
the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which
causes the water temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to
exceed one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit (40° C).
      6.   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through. Any
discharge of such oil is limited to one hundred (100) mg/l.
      7.   Any discharge of fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable
origin in a concentration greater than one hundred (100) mg/l.
      8.   Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems.
      9.   Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Manager in accordance with Section
19-74e.
      10.   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance, a hazard to life, or to prevent entry
into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
      11.   Any wastewater which imparts color that cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes or vegetable tanning
solutions, and which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's
effluent thereby violating the City's NPDES permit. Color (in combination with
turbidity) shall not cause the treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of
the compensation point for photosynthetic activity by more than ten (10)
percent from the seasonably established norm for aquatic life.
      12.   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except
as specifically approved by the Manager in compliance with applicable state or
federal regulations.
      13.   Any wastewater causing the effluent from the treatment plant to
fail a toxicity test.
      14.   Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents, or other
substances which cause excessive foaming in the POTW.
   b.   Federal categorical pretreatment standards. The national categorical
pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405
through 471 are hereby incorporated.
   c.   Specific pollutant limitations.
      1.   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against
pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing
in excess of the following daily maximum limits:
      Arsenic (As)                  0.60 mg/l

      Zinc (Zn)                  2.00 mg/l
      2.   Concentrations apply at the point where the industrial waste is
discharged to the POTW unless otherwise permitted. All concentrations for
metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. Mass
limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration based limitations
above may be imposed by the Manager.
   d.   City's right of revision. The City reserves the right to establish, by
division or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with:
      1.   The objectives presented in Section
19-72a. of this division; or
      2.   The general and specific prohibitions in paragraphs a. through c. of
this section.
   e.   Special agreement. The City reserves the right to enter into special
agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may
discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance
with a pretreatment standard or requirement. However, the industrial user may
request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40
CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment
standard from EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user
can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different
from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment
standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor
variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR
403.13.
   f.   Dilution. No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process
water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard
or requirement. The Manager may impose mass limitations on industrial users
when that industry is using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards
or requirements.
   g.   Discharge to manholes. No person shall discharge any substance into a
sewer appurtenance intended for maintenance, including but not limited to a
manhole or inspection port, without written permission from the Manager.
   h.   Direct discharges. Unless authorized by the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission, no person shall deposit or discharge any wastewater,
industrial waste, or polluted liquid on public or private property, into or
adjacent to any natural outlet, natural watercourse, storm sewer, street,
gutter, drainage ditch, or other area within the jurisdiction of the City.
(Ord. No. O-96-4, 1-24-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-80, 10/20/99)
Sec. 19-74.   Pretreatment of wastewater.
   a.   Pretreatment facilities. Industrial users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this division and shall achieve
compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the
prohibitions set out in Section
19-73 a. through c. above within the time limitations specified by EPA, the
state, or the Manager, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the Manager for review, and shall be acceptable to the Manager before
construction of the facility is initiated. The review of such plans and
operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable
discharge to the City under the provisions of this division.
   b.   Additional pretreatment measures.
      1.   Whenever deemed necessary, the Manager may require industrial users
to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams,
and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW, and
determine the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this
division.
      2.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided as required by
the City Plumbing Code or as determined by the Manager. All interception units
shall be of type and capacity specified by the plumbing code and shall be
easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be
inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly by the owner, at his expense in
accordance with the requirements of the City's Grease Trap Ordinance.
   c.   Accidental discharge/slug control plans. The Manager may require any
industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control
plan. At least once every two (2) years, the Manager shall evaluate whether
each significant industrial user needs such a plan. Any industrial user
required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan
shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges.
      2.   Description of stored chemicals.
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the prohibited discharges in Section
19-73a of this division.
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to: inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   d.   Tenant responsibility. Where an owner of property leases premises to

      4.   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s)
without the  Manager’s approval.
      5.   For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of ten (10) percent
or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be
deemed significant.
   f.   Reports of potential problems.
      1.   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems
for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in
Section
19-73 a. of this division), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to
immediately telephone and notify the City of the incident. This notification
shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and
volume (if known), and corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
      2.   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the industrial user
shall, unless waived by the Manager, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural
resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this division.
      3.   Failure to notify the Manager of potential problem discharges shall
be deemed a separate violation of this division.
   g.   Reports from nonsignificant industrial users. All industrial users not
subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the City as
the Manager may require.
   h.   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation:
      1.   The industrial user must notify the Manager within twenty- four (24)
hours of becoming aware of the violation.
      2.   The industrial user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Manager within thirty (30)
days after becoming aware of the violation.
      3.   The actions described in Subsections 1. and 2. above are not
required for the conventional pollutants of BOD5, COD, TSS, or TDS when the
surcharge limit is exceeded. If the daily maximum limit for any conventional
pollutant is exceeded, the requirements of Subsections 1. and 2. above apply. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-64, 4-23-2008)
   i.   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
      1.   Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste
shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge to the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more
than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW,
the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent
such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the
mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than
one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification
under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted
under Section
19-77 e. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of Section
19-77 a., c., and d. above.
      2.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection i above
of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months
during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any
hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
      3.   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the
POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of
the effective date of such regulations.
      4.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
   j.   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
   k.   Sample collection.
      1.   Except as indicated in Subsection 2. below, the industrial user
shall collect wastewater samples using approved composite collection
techniques. Samples and measurements taken as required shall be representative
of the nature and volume of the monitored discharge.
      2.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals shall be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      3.   Samples shall be taken at monitoring points specified by the
Manager, and such locations shall not be changed without notification to, and
the approval of, the Manager.
   l.   Determination of noncompliance. The Manager may use a grab sample(s) to
determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
   m.   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the U.S.Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern.
   n.     Record keeping. Industrial users shall retain, and make available for
inspection and copying, all records and information required to be gathered and
maintained under this division. These records shall remain available for a
period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended
for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this division, or
where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention
period by the Manager.  (Ord. No. O-96-4, 1-24-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-80, 10/20/99)

is complying with all requirements thereof.
         (a)   Industrial users shall allow the Manager ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
         (b)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City,
State, and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.
         (c)   Unreasonable delays in allowing City personnel access to the
industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this division.
         (d)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the Manager
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such an access shall be borne
by the industrial user.
      3.   The City, State, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the
industrial user's property or require installation of such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
         (a)   The Manager may require the industrial user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the industrial user at its own expense. Failure to keep monitoring
equipment in proper operating condition shall not be grounds to claim that
sample results are not representative of the industrial user's discharge. All
devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at
least annually to ensure their accuracy.
         (b)   The Manager may require the industrial user to install at its
own expense, an approved manhole or sampling point. Such manhole or sampling
point shall be accessible and safe, and located such that the samples may be
taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist, or
immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Manager.
      4.   The Manager or his duly authorized employee shall observe all safety
rules applicable to the industrial user's facility during inspections and
sampling events.
   b.   Search warrants. If the Manager has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property or any part thereof, and if the Manager has demonstrated
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division or
that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the
City designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the City Attorney shall petition the Municipal Court
Judge to issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the specific
location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything,
may be searched and/or seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be
served at reasonable hours by the Manager in the company of a uniformed police
officer of the City. In the event of an emergency affecting public health and
safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a warrant.  (Ord. No.
O-96-4, 1-24-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-80, 10/20/99)
Sec. 19-79.   Confidential information.
   Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits,
monitoring programs, and from City inspection and sampling activities, shall be
available to the public without restriction unless the industrial user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
City, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the industrial
user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction. (Ord. No. O-96-4, 1-24-96)
Sec. 19-80.   Publication of industrial users in significant non-compliance.
   a.   Requirement to publish. The Manager shall publish annually, in the
largest daily newspaper published in the City, a list of the industrial users
which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   b.   Definition of significant noncompliance. The term significant
noncompliance shall mean:
      1.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all the measurements taken
during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or
average limit for the same pollutant parameter;
      2.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three (33) percent or more of all the measurements for each
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equals or exceeds the
product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the
applicable TRC (TRC equals one and four-tenths (1.4) for BOD5, TSS, fats, oil
and grease, and one and two-tenths (1.2) for all other pollutants except pH);
      3.   Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment effluent limit
(daily maximum or longer term average) that the Manager determines has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of City personnel or the general public);
      4.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health, welfare, or to the environment, or has resulted in the City's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      5.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an industrial wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
      6.   Failure to provide, within thirty (30) days after the due date,
required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
      7.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
      8.   Any other violation or group of violations which the Manager
determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program. (Ord. No.O-96-4, 1-24-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-80, 10/20/99)
Sec. 19-81.   Administrative enforcement remedies.
   a.   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Manager finds that any user has
violated or is violating this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Manager may serve upon said user a written notice of violation. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of the City to take any action (including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action) without first issuing a
notice of violation.
   b.   Consent Order. The Manager is hereby empowered to enter into a Consent
Order establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders
shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant to Sections
19-81d. and
19-81e. below and shall be judicially enforceable.
   c.   Show Cause Order. The Manager may order any user which causes or
contributes to violation(s) of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to
appear before the Manager and show cause why a more severe enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the potential enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least seven (7) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any
authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as
ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing
date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other
action against the user.
   d.   Compliance Order. When the Manager finds that a user has violated or
continues to violate the division, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within the time specified. If the user does not come
into compliance within the specified time, appropriate penalties shall be
assessed accordingly unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
      Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
Compliance Order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a Compliance Order
release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a Compliance Order shall not be a prerequisite to taking
any other action against the user.
   e.   Cease and Desist Order. When the Manager finds that a user is violating
this division, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the
user's past violations are likely to recur, the Manager may issue an order to
the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:
         1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
         2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Issuance of a Cease and Desist Order shall not be a prerequisite to taking
any other action against the user.  (Ord. No. O-96-4, 1-24-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-
80, 10/20/99)
Sec. 19-82. Judicial enforcement remedies.
   a.   Consent Decree. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard or
requirement, or continues to violate the provisions of this division,
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Manager and the industrial user may
petition the State District Court or County Court at Law for a consent
agreement for the actions required to attain compliance with the wastewater
discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this division.
   b.   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard
or requirement, or continues to violate the provisions of this division, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Manager may petition the State
District Court or County Court at Law through the City Attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of
the industrial user. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a
prerequisite to taking any other action against a user.
   c.   Civil penalties.
      1.   Any user which has violated or continues to violate this division,
any order or wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable for a civil penalty of up
to two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per violation per day. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
      2.   The Manager may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.
      3.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court may take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice
requires.
      4.   Any person discharging a pollutant which results in the imposition
of penalties by any person or regulatory authority on the City shall be liable
for said penalties and any other costs incurred thereby.
      5.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against a user.
   d.   Criminal prosecution.
      1.   Any user that willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this division, any order or wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00) per violation per day.
      2.   Any user that willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). This penalty shall be in addition to any
other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under
state law.
      3.   Any user that knowingly makes any false statements, representations,
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
documentation filed, or required to be maintained pursuant to this division,
wastewater discharge permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or methods required under
this division shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than
two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per violation per day.
      4.   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a
fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per violation per day.
      5.   The City is entitled to pursue all other civil and criminal remedies
to which it is entitled under the authority of statutes or other ordinances
against a person continuing prohibited discharges or violating any other
provision of this division.
   e.   Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions in Sections
19-80 through
19-85 are not exclusive remedies. The City reserves the right to take any, all,
or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City's
enforcement response plan. However, the City reserves the right to take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the City is
empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant
user. These actions may be taken concurrently.  (Ord. No. O-96-4, 1-24-96)
(Ord. No. 0-99-80, 10/20/99)
Sec. 19-83.   Termination of sewer service.
   a.   Emergency suspension.
      1.   The Manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after
informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The Manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after
notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the
environment.
      2.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Manager shall
take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Manager shall allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Manager
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
set forth in Section
19-83b. are initiated against the user.
      3.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the Manager, prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under Sections
19-81c. and
19-83b., respectively.
      4.   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
   b.   Termination of discharge.
      1.   In addition to those provisions in Section
19-76d. of this division, any user that violates the following conditions of
this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or any order issued hereunder, is
subject to discharge termination:
         (a)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
         (b)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
         (c)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge.
         (d)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
         (e)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section
19-73 of this division.
      2.   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
19-81c. of this division why the proposed action should not be taken. (Ord. No.
O-96-4, 1-24-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-80, 10/20/99)
Sec. 19-84. Supplemental enforcement action.
   a.   Performance bonds. The Manager may decline to reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of
this division, any orders, or a previous wastewater discharge permit issued
hereunder, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the
City, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Manager to be necessary
to achieve consistent compliance.
   b.   Liability insurance. The Manager may decline to reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of
this division, any order, or a previous wastewater discharge permit issued
hereunder, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial
assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its
discharge.
   c.   Increased monitoring and reporting. When an industrial user has
demonstrated a history of noncompliance, the Manager may increase surveillance
of that industry, including but not limited to, additional self monitoring and
reporting.  (Ord. No. O-96-4, 1-24-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-80, 10/20/99)
Sec. 19-85.   Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
   a.     Act of God defense. 
1.   The Act of God defense constitutes a statutory affirmative defense [Texas
Water Code Section 7.251] in an action brought in municipal or State court.  If
a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a
pretreatment ordinance, or a permit issued under the ordinance, was caused
solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is
not a violation of the ordinance or permit.
2.   An industrial user who wishes to establish the Act of God affirmative
defense shall demonstrate, through relevant evidence that:
(a)   An event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance
or a permit issued under the ordinance occurred, and the sole cause of the
event was an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe; and
(b)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW
and the City within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event that would
otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under
the ordinance (if this information is provided orally, a written submission
must be provided within five days):
             (1)    a description of the event, and the nature and cause of the
event;
               (2)    the time period of the event, including exact dates and
times or, if still continuing, the anticipated time the event is expected to
continue; and
               (3)    steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the event.
3.   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user
seeking to establish the Act of God affirmative defense shall have the burden
of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an event that would
otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance, or a permit issued under
the ordinance, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other
catastrophe.
   b.   Upset. An upset constitutes an affirmative defense in an action brought
in federal court.
1.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in
which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused
by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
2.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of
Subsection 3. below are met.
3.   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(a)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of
the upset;
(b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike
manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;
(c)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW
and treatment plant operator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five (5) days.
(1)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance.
(2)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not
corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue.
(3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish
the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
5.   Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
6.   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards
upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility
is restored or an alternative.  (Ord. No. 0-2010-12, 1/27/2010)
Sec. 19-86. Industrial sewer rates/surcharges.
   a.   Sewer service rates. When an industrial user's wastewater discharge is
acceptable for treatment by the City's POTW, the industrial user shall provide
payment for sewer service which covers the costs of receiving, handling, and
treating such wastewater. Rates for service shall be as approved by the City
Council and as shown in
Chapter 19, Article IV., Division 1., Section
19-66.
   b.   Metering. In the event that any industrial user discharging to the POTW
is supplied partially or entirely by water not supplied by the City and the
water so supplied is not completely measured by a City water meter, or a meter
acceptable to the Manager, then the total amount of water so used and supplied
shall be otherwise measured or determined by the Manager in order to determine
the fair and reasonable charge to be made for sewer service provided. The
industrial user may install and maintain a meter acceptable to the Manager for
said purpose. In the interest of equity, the Manager may require the discharger
to provide an acceptable measuring device at a location accessible for reading
and checking to determine the quantity of waste being discharged.
   c.   Rate review. Industrial sewer rates shall be reviewed periodically and
shall be adjusted as necessary in accordance with state and federal regulations
for the determination of such rates.
   d.   Rate basis. The Manager will establish rates for service on the basis
of water used and wastewater discharged, and will reserve the right to
determine the applicable rate for each contributing industry and the method to
be used for measurement.
   e.   Surcharges. A surcharge may be imposed upon an industrial user for
discharges of the conventional pollutants of BOD5, COD, TSS, and TDS in excess
of the surcharge limit, but below the daily maximum limit. The purpose of a
surcharge is to recover the City's costs of receiving, handling, and treating
excessive conventional pollutant concentrations and encourage industrial users
to reduce pollutant loading in their discharges. Once established,  a surcharge
shall be in full force and effect for a minimum period of six (6) months. 
(Ord. No. O-96-4, 1-24-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-80, 10/20/99)
Sec. 19-87. Miscellaneous pretreatment charges and fees. 
   a.   Right to assess. The City may adopt reasonable charges and fees for
reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the City's pretreatment
program.
   b.   Charges and fees. Charges and fees which may be adopted by the City
include:
      1.   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost
of processing such applications.
      2.   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing an industrial user's discharge,
and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by industrial users.
      3.   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures
and construction.
      4.   Other fees as the Manager may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained in this division. These fees relate solely to the
matters covered by this division and are separate from all other fees, fines,
and penalties chargeable by the City. (Ord. No.O-96-4, 1-24-96) (Ord. No. 0-99-
80, 10/20/99)

be assessed on each lot leased on Lake Tyler.  See Division 6.  The annual
rental shall be adjusted at each annual anniversary date in an amount equal to
the increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for
the South (the geographic area including Smith County, Texas), as published by
the United States Department of Labor (or its successor document), from the
year in which the last rental increase was effective to the year in which the
latest rental increase is occurring times the then annual rental rate, but in
no event shall the amount of increases in rental exceed ten (10) percent at any
one time. In the event of a decrease in the C.P.I., no decrease in rental shall
be made; however, additional increases in rental shall not be made until the
C.P.I. rises above the point from which the last increase in rental was
determined, using 1993 as the base year. In July of every year, City staff will
calculate any rental increases required under this paragraph and such increases
shall be applicable to all leases coming due between the next October 1 and
September 30 of the next year. Any such rental increase will be automatic, with
City Staff to give lessee notice of such increase in the next bill sent to the
lessee.
       b.    Rental for all lots with leases originating after November 18,
2011  (and as described further in section 19-221a.). An annual rental fee will
be assessed on each lot leased on Lake Tyler equivalent to the city taxes which
would be paid if the property and improvements were privately owned and located
within the City of Tyler, Texas. Lease payments shall be established using the
tax rate adopted by the Tyler City Council and applied to initial land lease
value established by the City plus any improvement values established by Smith
County Appraisal District.

Sec. 19-202. Renewal of leases.
   Each lease shall automatically be renewed for the term specified in the
original lease or in the addendum by the payment in advance of each annual
rental provided:

not in default under the terms of said agreements or is in the process of
curing and does cure any default in accordance with the terms of Lessee’s
contractual obligations under the original lease and Addendum;
   b.   If lessee does not have an Addendum to the original lease and has cured
any default about which the City has given 45 days written notice to Lessee
sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to Lessee’s last
known address.  Lessee may receive an additional period of time to cure and
remedy said default with the City’s prior written approval, said approval not
to be unreasonably withheld.  If Lessee fails to remedy such default under this
provision, the lease shall terminate and Lessee shall be given 60 days to
remove any improvements.  If Lessee fails to act within the specified time, the
lease will become null and void and the improvements thereon will revert to the
City.  Lessee has at all times conformed with the applicable rules and
regulations governing the lake and property. Upon failure to pay the rental of
any lot within forty-five (45) days from due date, the lessee shall be notified
and given a maximum of sixty (60) days in which to remove any improvements. If
lessee fails to act within the specified time the lease shall will become null
and void and the improvements thereon will revert to the City.  (Ord. No. 0-97-

application, the Manager shall have authority to consent to encumbrance of the
leasehold, and it being understood that if any such lien is foreclosed the City
will consent to the assignment of such lease to the purchaser at the
foreclosure sale, provided the purchaser shall take such lease subject to all
rules and ordinances governing and controlling the use thereof, and subject to
all of the terms and conditions of the lease as modified, and the holder of an
encumbrance of any such property shall have the privilege of paying the annual
renewal rental on any such lot(s) upon which an encumbrance may exist or upon
which a foreclosure may be granted.  (Ord. 0-97-52, 10/22/97) (Ord. No. 0-99-

setback line, and describing the location and size of the septic system to be
installed.  As applicable, plans for boathouses, piers, retaining walls,
swimming pools, boat ramps, and other structures must also be approved through
the method described above.  Approval for construction will be granted upon
confirmation of a current lease on Lake Tyler lots, of current lot ownership
registration with the City Clerk on Lake Tyler East lots, and following a
physical on-site inspection by a Lake Supervisor.  A fee for each Approval for
Construction form submitted shall be collected when the form is presented to

   f.   The lease for an additional lot(s) created by resubdivision, excluding
the original lot subdivided when occupied by existing lessee, shall be a thirty
(30) year term lease automatically extended at the end of the regular term,
subject to compliance with lease conditions. When the existing lessee transfers
their interest to another, the new lessee must take the new lease.
   g.   An annual lease fee will be assessed on lots created by subdivision
under this section.  (See Division 6)  The annual rental for lots created and
leased prior to November 18, 2011 shall be adjusted at each annual anniversary
date in an amount equal to the increase in the Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the South (the geographic area including Smith
County, Texas), as published by the United States Department of Labor (or its
successor document), from the year in which the last rental increase was
effective to the year in which the latest rental increase is occurring times
the then annual rental rate, but in no event shall the amount of increases in
rental exceed ten (10) percent at any one time. In the event of a decrease in
the C.P.I., no decrease in rental shall be made; however, additional increases
in rental shall not be made until the C.P.I. rises above the point from which
the last increase in rental was determined, using 1997 as the base year. In
July of every year, City Staff will calculate any rental increases required
under this paragraph and such increases shall be applicable to all leases
coming due between the next October 1 and September 30 of the next year. Any
such rental increase will be automatic, with Manager to give lessee notice of
such increase in the next bill.  For lots created and leased after November 18,
2011, the annual lease payment shall be equivalent to the city taxes which
would be paid if the property and improvements were privately owned and located
within the City of Tyler, Texas. Lease payments shall be established using the
tax rate adopted by the Tyler City Council and applied to the initial land
lease value established by the City plus any improvement values established by
Smith County Appraisal District.
      In the situation where a previously created large club lot is divided
into 2 or more smaller lots, one of the new smaller lots would be deemed as the
original lot while all the other new smaller lots would be treated as new lots
subject to the new fees and process.
   h.   Access to each new lot created by resubdivision shall be provided by
the subdivider.  Such access shall be to the nearest public road, but shall
remain private.  The access road shall be thirty (30) feet wide.
   i.   Access roadways shall be built to no less than Smith County road
construction standards and shall be constructed at the sole expense of the
subdivider and/or lessee.  A perpetual maintenance agreement shall be signed by
all lessees of lots within a resubdivided plat.  The agreement will establish a
perpetual maintenance fund to care for the roadway.  Failure to establish and
maintain a perpetual maintenance agreement and fund shall be considered a
violation of  the  lease, and thus, grounds for default.  All access roadways
shall be shown on the resubdivision plat.  Lease documents resulting from the
subdivision shall contain a provision requiring lessee to acknowledge
responsibility for the maintenance of all private access roadway systems.

4.   Customers shall be required to comply with the requirements and
restrictions on certain non-essential water uses.
e.   Stage 5 - Emergency Water Shortage conditions are reached when:
1.     Major water line breaks, one of the water treatment facilities is
rendered inoperable, or pump or system failures occur which cause unprecedented
loss of capability to provide water service.
2.   When Total Daily Water Demand equals or exceeds 70 million gallons a day
for five (5) consecutive days.
3.   Natural or man-made contamination of water supply (s) has occurred.
   4.   Customers shall be required to comply with the requirements and
restrictions on certain non-essential water uses.
f.   In the event Stages 3, 4 or 5 conditions persist (Item c., Item d. and
Item e. above) for an extended period of time, the City may ration water usage
and/or terminate service to selected users of the system in accordance with the
following sequence:
1.   Hospitals
2.   Nursing Homes
3.   Schools
4.   Industrial
5.   Commercial
   6.   Residential
   7.   Recreational 
g.   The City of Tyler is forward thinking and is well prepared in the
availability of water and water sources.  Currently, the City of Tyler has
three (3) major water sources available for high water demand and emergency
drought events.  The City operates two (2) surface water treatment plants.  The
primary source is Lake Tyler and Lake Tyler East which is treated and
distributed by the Golden Road Water Treatment Plant.  Lake Tyler/Lake Tyler
East have a combined permitted water right for 40,325 acre feet per year. The
Golden Road Plant is rated at twenty-eight (28) MGD.  The City's secondary
source is Lake Palestine and the city has 67,200 acre feet per year available
from this source.  Raw water is piped from Lake Palestine to the Lake Palestine
Water Treatment Plant for treatment and distribution.  The Lake Palestine water
treatment plant is rated at thirty (30) MGD.  The third source is 12 (active)
deep ground water wells, however, only 10 of the wells are used regularly.  Two
of the wells are only operated in emergency conditions.  The wells pull from
the Carrizo/Wilcox Aquifer.  The wells are used regularly and for backup.  The
wells have the combined capacity of approximately eight (8) MGD. Also, the city
has Lake Bellwood, in the past used to supply raw water to industries, with
2,200 acre feet per year available.  This is minor in comparison to the other 3
major sources of water the City has available to it. In case of a failure of
one of the water treatment plants the other plant will take over water
production for distribution.  The wells will be circulated, and the elevated
storage monitored, to help with peak and emergency demands during a drought, or
other possible water shortage event.

Section 19-302.   Penalties.
Users of City water except for the City, that do not comply with Section III of
this Ordinance shall be subject to a penalty and a fine of not less than $10.00
per day nor more than $200.00 per day for each day of noncompliance and/or
disconnection or discontinuance of water services to such users by the City. 
(Ord. 0-2011-15, 2/23/11)
Section 19-303.   Introduction.
a.   The 69th Texas Legislature passed House Bill (HB) 2 and House Joint
Resolution (HJR) 6 in 1986. This Act requires that a Water Conservation Plan
and Emergency Demand Management Plan be adopted by political subdivisions.
House Bill 2 was approved by Texas Voters November 6, 1995, becoming an
amendment to the Texas Constitution. In 2002 the State of Texas adopted the
State Water Plan which recognizes the need for water conservation in order to
meet future needs of Texas. In 2003, the 78th Texas Legislature established the
Water Conservation Implementation Task Force via passage of Senate Bill (SB)
1094. In SB 1094 the task force was directed to review, evaluate and recommend
several water based conservation programs including the development of a best
management practices guide for use by Regional Water Planning Groups and
political subdivisions responsible for water delivery service. These actions
enabled the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and the Texas
Water Development Board (TWDB) to develop Best Management Practices (BMP’s)
guidelines, Task 1 Section 3 of SB 1094, for water providers of the state to
consider while updating Water Conservation and Emergency Demand Management
Plans. The TWDB and the TCEQ were to make efforts to implement HB 2660 which
directed the two agencies to identify quantified target goals for water
conservation for water suppliers and other entities. In 2007 House Bill 4
amended the Texas Water Code by requiring the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (TCEQ) to require retail public utilities that provide potable water to
3300 or more connections to submit a Water Conservation Plan to the Texas Water
Development Board. The Plan must include specific targets and goals developed
by the utility using Best Management Practices or other strategies to reduce
water waste, loss, and consumption. These reduction goals are to be based on
municipal use in gallons per capita per day.
b.   Utilization of all State resources is dictated, if affordable development
is to occur on a statewide basis. Water, a basic human need, will be a major
factor in development. Conservation of water is necessary if we are to meet
future needs for our most valuable resource.
c.   Passage of House Bill 2 and House Joint Resolution 6, Senate Bill (SB)
1094, House Bill 2660, and in 2007 House Bill 4 by the Texas Legislature and
Voters of Texas, reflect that the need for conservation of water resources has
been recognized and is a high priority for State Officials as well as the
Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies. All Water
Conservation Plans must be updated every five years and are required to send in
annual information on the effectiveness of the Best Management Practices
adopted. The Regional Water Planning Group, TCEQ, and the Texas Water
Development Board should be sent the Conservation Plan Updates as well as the
annual reports for Best Management Practice effectiveness.
d.   Planning Area - Proposed Project
The planning area consists of the City of Tyler and its extraterritorial
jurisdiction which contains approximately 57 square miles. Tyler has a current
population of 104,798 (per the 2016 American Community Survey Estimate).
e.   Contingency Plan
System improvements will be developed from study and evaluation of existing
conditions to establish a specific program for meeting desired goals. BMP’s
will be implemented to aid in the reduction of per capita water usage to
attempt to meet state established targets.

      2.   Texas Water Development Board
      3.   Texas Department of State Health Services
      4.   Environmental Protection Agency
   g.   Needs and Goals
1.   Utilization of all State resources is dictated if affordable development
is to occur on a state wide basis. Water, a basic human need, will be a major
factor in development. Conservation of water is necessary if we are to meet
future needs for our most valuable resource.
2.   Homeowner and user education is emphasized in the City of Tyler
Conservation Plan to meet the 69th Texas Legislature (1995), 78th Texas
Legislature (2003) requirements as dictated by House Bill (HB) 2, House Joint
Resolution (HJR) 6 (1995), Senate Bill (SB) 1094 (2003) and House Bill (HB)
2260. The plan has been prepared using guidelines, from the TWDB and TCEQ,
which have been developed to meet requirements of State and Federal
regulations.
3.   Tyler, through customer education, city maintenance and operation, and
implementation of planning elements, had originally established dual goals for
the reduction of water waste, water loss and usage.  These goals have been
updated using 2014 through 2018 utility data information:
         (a) Based on the historic five-year average of municipal water use of
230 gallon per capita day (gpcd), a five-year goal to a reduce the municipal
water use by 1 % annually, or to 217 gpcd, and a ten-year goal to reduce the
municipal water use by ten percent (10%) to 206 gpcd has been set.
         (b)Based on 2018 residential water use of 105 gpcd, the residential
water use goals are a three percent (3%) reduction to 102 gpcd over five years
and a ten-year goal to reduce residential water usage by 6 percent (6%) or 99
gpcd. During this 5-year update the City of Tyler has established these new
goals based on corrected historical data to ensure the metrics are quantifiable
and achievable. 
         (c) Based on the 2018 municipal water loss of 40 gpcd, the five-year
goal for municipal water loss is set at 38 gpcd, or a five percent reduction,
and the ten-year goal is to reduce water loss by 10 percent, for a goal of 36
gpcd. Goals will be met by continued implementation of the included best
management practices and from other outlined planning elements.
4.   Achieving the established goals will conserve our most valuable resource,
water.  It will also enable existing facilities to provide service for
additional customers without further expenditures for expansion.  However, if
the need does arise, the city of Tyler does have the capability of expanding
the water treatment plants, such as the Lake Palestine Water Treatment Plant,
to allow for future growth for the service area.
h.   Public Involvement
1.   The City of Tyler City Council meets on a regular basis on the 2nd and 4th
Wednesday of each month at 9:00 am. The meeting agenda is posted in accordance
with State law, listing items for discussion and to be acted upon by the
Council. The agenda is also posted on the City of Tyler website and a cable
television channel dedicated to public information. Meetings are open to the
Public, and the public is given an opportunity to speak and voice their views
and opinions when listed on the agenda for comment.
2.   Council meetings are often attended by representatives of local newspapers
and videotaped by local television news. The meetings are videotaped in their
entirety by the City and aired on the City’s cable television channel.  (Ord.
0-2011-15, 2/23/11) (Ord. O-2019-71; 8/28/19)
Section 19-304.   Water Conservation Plan and Best Management Practices.
a.   The following planning elements have been developed in accordance with the
requirements listed in TCEQ regulations and include guidelines by the Texas
Water Development Board and the Water Conservation Implementation Task Force.
b.   The Best Management Practices that have been adopted and implemented by
the City of Tyler are:
Educational Best Management Practice (BMP)
Plumbing Codes BMP
Water Conservation Retrofit Program
Conservation Oriented Water Rate Structure
System Water Audit and Water Loss BMP
Industrial Alternate Sources and Reuse BMP
Metering of All Connections and Retrofit of Existing Connections BMP
Prohibition on Wasting Water BMP
Industrial Site Specific Conservation BMP
Cooling Towers BMP
Contracts with Other Political Subdivisions
Record Management System
Annual Reporting (Ord. No. 0-2014-99; 10/22/14)
c.   Educational Best Management Practice
The City of Tyler will inform its customers of various recommended methods for
reduction in water consumption. Generally, a majority of water consumption in
the City is consumed by residential customers. Therefore, the target area for
educational information is residential customers.
1.   Program or activities will consist of the activities listed:
(a)   A Fact Sheet explaining the Conservation Plan will be developed and made
available to the customers and schools.
(b)   An article will be placed in the local newspaper, correlated with Fact
Sheet preparation and include information on how to acquire the “Homeowners
Guide”, highlights of water saving methods, and  elaboration on available
brochures. The brochures will be available at Tyler Water Utilities Office and
certain brochures will be mailed directly to the customer. One of the brochures
will target one particular household water using appliance and include specific
measures for conserving water.
(c)   Make available to each new customer the “Homeowner’s Guide to Water Use
and Conservation”, “ Water…Half a Hundred Ways to Save It, “How to Save Water
Outside the Home”, or “How to Save Water Inside the Home”. These new customer
guides will be available at Tyler Water Utilities Office. The city will also
update any guides and available materials on an annual basis.
2.   The revised program will consist of the following listed activities:
         (a)     Updates to the water conservation portion of the Tyler Water
Utilities webpage explaining ways that water conservation can be achieved at
home.
         (b)     Brochures relating to outside household use, and car washing,
lawn watering, correlated to weather predictions  are available to customers in
the TWU office and made available either by mail out, pick up or via the City's
web page.
(c)   “Homeowner’s Guide to Water Use and Conservation”, “ Water…Half a Hundred
Ways to Save It, “How to Save Water Outside the Home”, or “How to Save Water
Inside the Home” brochures will continue to be distributed to new customers.
3.   New customers will be advised of the City’s Conservation Program and
provided with a copy of Homeowners Guide and other listed guides and brochures,
if requested. The City will utilize resource materials available from the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality and other agencies or organizations which
develop and distribute pertinent information or data on water conservation to
water customers throughout the state.
4.   Educational materials will be given to area schools for use with taught
curriculum to emphasize the importance of conservation. The target goal is to
reach 10% of students on an annual basis, on a tiered program.
5.   Educational tours of the water and wastewater treatment facilities are
given to area schools, groups, and clubs to provide education on the operation
of the facilities and the need for conservation methods at home, work, and
school.
6.   Educational BMPs are usually are not quantifiable, therefore an estimate
of savings will not be included for this BMP. The end result of an educational
program is a long-term investment in the customers and their families that when
taught conservation it will be more likely that they will follow the teachings
and therefore conserve water and money through installation of water saving
devices, performing outside watering activities at appropriate times and with
proper tools.
d.   Implementation

      1.   Educational materials have been distributed to area elementary
schools starting the first year along with information regarding the
availability for tours to the water and wastewater treatment facilities.
   2.   During the second year of implementation, the area intermediate/ middle
schools were targeted for educational materials and informational tours. 
   3.   The third year of implementation targeted the area high schools and
higher education facilities.  Tours for this level was also available. 
Materials and other such programs are made available.
   4.   Organizations, clubs and groups including scouting programs, 4-H, and
boys & girls clubs were encouraged to participate in the tour programs and
received educational materials.
   5.   Documentation of the educational materials and type of materials made
available to the schools, groups, clubs and other organizations was kept on
file and reported annually.  The report included the approximate percent of
students reached by the distribution of such materials and that said materials
met state curriculum requirements.  This information is also reported on the
required annual reports to TCEQ and TWDB.
   6.   Documentation of the number of presentations made on an annual basis
will be kept on file and reported annually.
   7.   An annual budget for the educational materials and presentation
programs related to conservation shall also be included in the annual report.
e.   Plumbing Codes
   The City of Tyler currently uses the 2015 edition of the International
Plumbing Code as the plumbing code.  This Code included requirements for the
use of water saving plumbing fixtures in new construction.
f.   Water Conservation Retrofit Program:
The City of Tyler encourages customers to utilize low demand fixtures and
appliances through proposed educational sources described in this Plan.  The
City advises customers of low water demand items, shower heads, toilet dams,
etc., by mail, and/or publication of newspaper articles, emphasizing the
importance of water saving devices.  The City will contact local suppliers of
plumbing supplies advising them of the water saving drive content.  Suppliers
will be encouraged to stock low water usage fixtures and low water use
supplies.  Different programs for new more energy efficient appliances and
household items will be offered either through the city or in partnership with
the city to customers.  Typically, these programs are brought to the attention
of the customers via the city's webpage and/ or by publication using various
types of media.
g.   Conservation Oriented Water Rate Structure
City of Tyler Water Rate Structure
(30 TAC 288.2 (a)(1)(H))(City of Tyler Code Section 19.60)
Currently, the City of Tyler's rate structure is a "Declining Block" Rate
Structure.  The Declining Block Rate Structure is cost-based and does not
encourage the excessive use of water. Tyler uses a declining block rate
structure because it reflects the manner in which costs are incurred and
equitably allocates these costs among the various types of customers served. 
Tyler reviews and updates its costs and usage patterns every five years and
updates its rates accordingly. The City is currently reviewing this rate
structure and plans to convert to an inclining block rate design to conform to
TCEQ regulations and TWDB guidelines, with a proposed implementation date of
October 1, 2019.
h.   System Water Audit and Water Loss
1.   The city of Tyler will implement the System Water Audit and Water Loss BMP
from the TCEQ and TWDB Best Management Practices Guidelines starting in the
first year and in phases through the remainder of the first five year planning
period.
2.   The City conducted a system water audit in two parts, the first of which
is known as a "Top Down" audit. The city used existing records to determine
estimated annual water loss.  Previously, the city of Tyler has a water loss of
approximately 10 %.  The city has been fortunate and continued diligently to
keep other information such as customer billing summaries, leak repair
summaries, meter change out summaries and other relevant water use summaries
and was able to continue the current number of approximately 9 to 10%,
depending on the season.  The water utility billing software is currently
capable of reporting the necessary "top-down" audit information needed. 
Annually the city gathers the "top down" audit information, they then determine
the areas of concern and the proper conservation techniques to implement to
bring down the water loss percentage and report this information to the
appropriate agency.  The City of Tyler's goal is to have the lowest percentage
of "unaccounted for water" or "water loss" possible.  The City has set a target
goal of an ILI of 3.  If the ILI of 3 is still not met with implementing the
BMP, the city will continue with the second step of the water audit.
3.   Several phases of the "bottom-up" portion of the water audit were
implemented over the remainder of this last five year period.  This second
step, involved the detailed investigation of policies and procedures of the
utility.  The "bottom-up" portion of the audit also includes procedures for all
water use by the fire department, for line flushing, street cleaning and all
other authorized uses to be metered and or accounted for.
4.   A “leak detection program” will be implemented to monitor the system for
leaks. Records will be kept to track the repair of the leak including the
length of time for repair, pressure of the repaired line, and approximate
amount of water lost due to the leak.
5.   A program to monitor system pressures will also be set up to monitor
pressures throughout the system to aid in locating line leaks.
6.   A computerized water model of the Tyler water system will be prepared and
added to as necessary.
i.   Implementation
The City of Tyler has implemented the BMP using all available resources.  The
city's goal, as stated previously, is an ILI of 3.  In order to reach this
goal, the city will have to continue to be proactive in the actions and steps
taken during the continued implementation of the Water Loss Audit Best
Management Practice.  Descriptions of the steps taken are as follows:
1.   A utility system water model was prepared.  The system model is
instrumental in assessing large leakage loss amounts, system pressures and
confirming pressure zones. 
2.   Staff will continue to be conservation minded in the operating pressures
of the water system.  The pressures will differ depending on the season,
topography, fire demand, and elevated storage tank levels.
3.   The water utilities staff will make regular inspections on water mains,
fittings, and connections, to include fire hydrants. Results are kept as
reference for annual updates.
4.   A leak detection program was started including training for all water
utilities staff.
(a)   Staff performs leak surveys in addition to the regular inspections of the
water mains and connections.
(b)   Leaks are tracked by the Utilities Department for water loss estimation,
time from report to repair, and volume of leak.
(c)   Customer complaints/ reports of leakage, taste and odor and all other
complaints are kept on file with the Utilities Department.
5.   All meter readers and maintenance employees will have training on visual
inspections and leak detection.  A previously implemented citywide meter
change-out program has been completed.  A meter repair and replacement program
will continue which includes the following procedures:
(a)   Failed meters will be replaced when located.
(b)   Meters replaced through the City’s contract with Johnson Controls have a
ten year warranty.
(c)   2 % of meters will be tested annually to be within 5% accuracy.
(d)   All municipal connections will be metered for increased accuracy of water
use.
(e)   A street cleaner water use tracking method has been put in place and
monitored.
(f)   Unauthorized taps or water thefts will be assessed a charge for the
illegal tap, and disconnection of the illegal tap.
j.   Water Audits and Leak Detection
1.   Another aspect to the water audit BMP is the monitoring of monthly
consumption. All records are kept up to date and monitored for fluctuation. 
The Audit System has become a major tool in system management.  This Plan has
developed a reliable and effective leak detection program.  It is estimated
unaccounted for water can be reduced by approximately one percent (1%) per
year.  The City is aware that assistance in leak detecting surveys can be
obtained from the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Staff.  The TWDB has
portable leak detection equipment available for loan to municipalities and can
provide personnel for demonstration of equipment and assist in planning survey
programs.
2.   The city wide meter replacement and aggressive enactment of a stricter
detection program has enabled city staff to determine the need for possibly
seeking further assistance for the use of electronic equipment when necessary. 
The current detection program consists of the following observations and
activities:
(a)   Leaks reported by citizens.
(b)   Leak detection by Meter Readers.
(c)   Continual checking and servicing of production, pumping and storage
facilities.
      (d)   Quick response by water utilities staff to respond to reported
problems.
k.   Industrial Alternate Sources and Reuse of Process Water
1.   Area industrial customers were contacted to determine if reuse and
recycling is being employed.  One such water customer, Kelly & Vesuvius, Inc.,
uses raw untreated water and reuses wastewater by returning it to their product
line and reusing it for process again.
2.   However, at this time wastewater reuse is not possible by the city of
Tyler.  The location of the Wastewater treatment plant with relation to
industrial users is not conducive.  The City is not located in an arid section
of Texas, and therefore reuse for irrigation purposes has not been developed.
l.   Prohibition on Wasting Water
1.   The city of Tyler, through an ordinance already in place, requires water
users to be conservation minded when watering and using water, whether it is
residential or commercial.  The adopted city ordinance is posted on the city's
website.  During the Education BMP, the education of the city's customers has
been detailed.  Educational materials have been available at the Tyler Water
Utilities Office and others have been mailed directly to the customer.
2.   A system has been developed to track offenders and include violations,
compliance notification, and other pertinent information.  Compliance
notifications are kept up to date to help locate potential theft situations. 
The city of Tyler is committed to keep the citizens of Tyler educated on the
importance of water conservation. 
m.   Industrial Site Specific Conservation
Southwest Dairies is a large industrial water user within the city of Tyler's
water system.  The dairy has installed new technology to reduce their water
consumption and increase the efficiency of the water that is utilized in the
operation of the plant.
n.   Cooling Towers
Trane Corporation is an industrial business located within the Tyler water
system.  Trane Corp. has partial use of the G.E. Elevated Water Tank for use in
their plant.  This major industrial water consumer uses cooling towers in its
process.  The Trane Corporation has a policy to periodically modify and replace
the cooling towers, as necessary.  The replacement and modification to the
cooling towers at the plant increases the efficiency of the systems as it
relates to water usage.
o.   Means of Implementation and Enforcement
The City Manager, through his staff, has implemented the Conservation Plan and
Best Management Practices (BMP) in accordance with City Council adoption of the
Plan updates and included Best Management Practices.  Enforcement will be
provided by:
1.   Refusing to provide taps for customers who do not meet requirements for
Water Conservation fixtures as established by adopted international Plumbing
Code.
2.   Nonpayment of water bills will initiate prompt discontinuation of service.
Service will be disconnected.
3.   Analysis of water rates and adjusting rates as deemed appropriately by the
City Council.
4.   Immediate repair of leaks or the service will be shut off until the leak
has been properly fixed. (Currently in a city ordinance)
5.   Prosecution of water thefts with enforcing tap fees and immediate
discontinuation  of the water service including but not limited to having the
meter locked out on any legal meters that were used for the illegal tap.
p.   Contracts With Other Political Subdivisions
   1.    Any political subdivision and/or wholesale customer contracting for
water from the City of Tyler must have (1) an approved Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality Water Conservation and Emergency Demand Management Plan
in effect and/ or (2) must officially adopt applicable provisions of the City
of Tyler's Water Conservation Drought Contingency and Emergency Demand
Management Plan.  Currently the City of Tyler has wholesale water contracts
with the city of Whitehouse, Community Water and Walnut Grove Water Supply
Corporation.
   2.    All City of Tyler Wholesale Water Contracts include the following,
under Article 6.3 Water Conservation and Demand Management:
   "6.3    Water Conservation.  Wholesale Water Buyer shall cooperate with and
assist Tyler in its efforts to develop and implement plans, programs, and rules
to develop water resources and to promote practices, techniques, and
technologies that will reduce the consumption of water, reduce the loss or
waste of water, improve the efficiency in use of water, or increase the
recycling and reuse of water.  This may include the development of any
conservation rationing plans by either Tyler or Wholesale Water Buyer that may
be necessary or appropriate to address operational constraints, whether or not
the same are required by any state or federal regulatory agency.  Wholesale
Water Buyer agrees to develop and implement drought contingency and
conservation plans or measures required by federal or state agencies or other
regulatory jurisdictions, including but not limited to 30 TAC Section  288.2
(a)(2) and (3).  The buyer shall provide a copy of such plans to Tyler within
ten (10) days of Plan implementation date.  Such Plans shall be consistent with
and as stringent as Tyler's adopted Plans.  If Tyler determines that the
Buyer's plans do not meet this standard, Tyler shall notify the Buyer of the
deficiency in writing.  The Buyer shall then amend its plans to and re-submit
the Plans for Tyler's review.
   6.3(a)    Demand Management. If Tyler shall manage demand through rationing
the use of water to its retail customers, then a proportional rationing of
water supplied to  (name of wholesale company)  by Tyler shall be instituted,
at Tyler's option.  Rationing does not relieve buyer from its obligation to pay
the monthly Demand Charge. See Exhibit below this section for approximate
reductions based on Average Daily Demand.

premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the City is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the City of Tyler may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
Sec. 19-319.  Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants
by best management practices.
   The City of Tyler will adopt requirements identifying Best Management
Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or waters of the U.S.  The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid TPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this section.  These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the TPDES permit.
Sec. 19-320.  Watercourse Protection.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
Sec. 19- 321.  Notification of spills.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials
said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the
occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-
hazardous materials, said person shall notify the City of Tyler in person or by
phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person
or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
City of Tyler within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge
of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
Sec. 19-322.  Enforcement.
   a.   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the City of Tyler finds that a person
has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this Article, the
City of Tyler may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:

      2.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      3.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      4.   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and
      5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
      6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   b.   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by designated City personnel or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
Sec. 19-323.  Appeal of Notice of violation.
   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation that believes that the true
intent of this Article or any of the regulations thereunder have been
misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted or applied, may appeal the
determination of the City of Tyler pursuant to Chapter 1, Article IV. The
notice of appeal must be received within 10 days from the date of the Notice of
Violation.
Sec. 19-324.  Enforcement Measures After Appeal.
   If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the Notice of Violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within 10 days
of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the City
of Tyler, then representatives of the City of Tyler may enter upon the subject
private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to
abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any
person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow

IV. If the amount due is not paid within 30 days, the City of Tyler may file a
statement of such bill and the reasons therefore with the County Clerk.  Said
statement of bill of costs shall only include the City's actual expenses for
correcting violations of the Article, as well as any interest thereon as
authorized by this section and State law.  From the date of such filing, City
shall have a lien on the lot or parcel upon which such expenses are incurred,
unless the property is a homestead protected by the Texas Constitution.  The
amount of debt on liens for correction of violations under this Article shall
accumulate interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date on
which payment was due.  For any debt and interest, suit may be instituted and
recovery and foreclosure had in the name of the City.  In such suits the
aforementioned statement, or certified copy thereof, shall be deemed prima
facie evidence of the debt and interest thereon.  The City Manager is hereby
authorized, under appropriate circumstances, to waive and/or approve the
release of a lien up to the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).
Sec. 19-326.  Injunctive Relief.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to
comply with any of the requirements of this Article.  If a person has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this Article, the City of Tyler may
petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from
activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to
perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
Sec. 19-327.  Compensatory Action.

Sec. 20-31. Location of Well near Residence or Commercial Buildings; Permission
of Adjacent Owners; Waivers.
   a.   Except as otherwise provided herein, no well shall be drilled and no
permit shall be issued for any well to be drilled within three hundred feet
(300') of any residence, commercial building, or water facilities such as
elevated ground storage tanks, lift stations, wells, treatment plants, booster
station, etc., which is permanently affixed to the realty, without the
applicant having first secured the written permission of the owner(s) of said
building.  For purposes of this ordinance, permission shall not be required
from the owners of mobile homes unless the owner of said mobile home also owns
the real property on which the mobile home is located.  Signatures for waivers
will be needed from landowners only; signatures are not required from tenants
in said buildings.
   b.   In measuring said three hundred foot (300") distance, all measurements
will be made from the proposed wellhead location to the closest load-bearing
and supporting wall structure of each building. All measurements are to be made
to those portions of said buildings which are intended to be habitable or
occupied on a full-time basis; storage sheds, gazebos, covered patios and
similar structures that are not enclosed are not to be considered in making
such measurements. All measurements will be made to the actual wall surface and
not to any overhanging roof eave or similar structure. 
   c.   If any property owner denies access to their property for purposes of
determining the distance measurement from the wellhead to the walls of the
property owner's structure, then distances will be determined using
methodologies such as transit and angle measurements or other similar
methodology acceptable to the City Engineer which such distances shall be
accepted for all purposes under this ordinance as incontestable. 
   d.   Any waiver form used to obtain written permission of the property owner
or owner’s representative of any building as required herein shall contain, as
a minimum, the following:
      1.   Name and address of the property owner;
      2.   Clear and unequivocable statement that the property owner agrees to
the permitting of the well as reflected by the duly acknowledged signature of
the property owner appearing on said form;
      3.   Statement of notice to the property owner that a permit to drill the
well will not be granted until the applicant complies with all the terms of
Chapter 10 of this Code.
   e.   Any waiver form used to obtain written permission of the owner or owner
representative of any building must state the term of the waiver in the
document itself, not to exceed the term of the permit.
   f.   The permit applicant shall make a good faith bona fide attempt to
acquire the approval of all of the owners of the residential and commercial
buildings located within three hundred feet (300') of any proposed well on the
requisite form as specified herein. In so doing, the applicant shall provide
true and accurate information to the property owner. If the applicant is
successful in obtaining 100% of the necessary waivers, the applicant will be
qualified to seek a Level A or B permit as otherwise specified herein.  If,
however, all of the owners of the residences and commercial buildings located
within three hundred feet (300') of any proposed well have not given their
written permission, then the applicant will be required to obtain a Level C
permit as specified herein. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-32. Security Required.
   a.   Generally.  If a permit is approved for issuance by the City under the
terms of this Chapter for the drilling and operation of a well, no actual
drilling operation shall be commenced until the Permittee shall file with the
City Engineer and maintain in current status sufficient security in the form of
a bond or certificate of deposit approved for form by the City Attorney, or
cash in lieu of the full amount of the bond, in such principal sum as
determined by the City Manager, but to be not less than the aggregate sum of
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00).  Any such bond posted as required herein
shall consist of a $5,000.00 cash bond and the remaining $45,000.00 in the form
of a surety bond executed by a reliable insurance company authorized to do
business in the State of Texas as surety, and with the Permittee as principal,
running to the City, for the benefit of the City and all persons concerned.  In
lieu of the surety portion of the bond, any certificate of deposit filed as
permitted herein shall be free of any prior claim or obligation and shall not
be pledged as security for any other purposes save and except as specified
herein.  In no instance, however, shall there be less than a five thousand
dollar ($5,000.00) cash bond posted as part of the total security.  Any such
bond or other security pledged as required herein shall be effective on or
before the date it is filed with the City Engineer and remain in force and
effect for a period of at least six (6) months subsequent to the expiration of
the term of the permit issued herein.
   b.   Supplemental security.  If the proceeds of the $5,000.00 cash bond or
other security required herein are applied to remedy noncompliance as provided
in Sec. 20-115, the Permittee shall be required to provide immediately
additional security of a like kind to maintain at all times the level of
security as required under this Chapter.  Failure to maintain security at all
times as required under this Chapter shall constitute cause for revocation of
permit as provided in Sec.
20-116.
   c.   Additional security.  If at any time the City Manager reasonably
considers any Permittee's bond or other security to be insufficient, the
Manager may require the Permittee to file a new bond or additional security.
   d.   Conditions of security.  Any security filed as required under this
section shall be conditioned, on penalty of forfeiture or partial forfeiture to
the City without written notice, on the following:
      1.   That Permittee shall comply with all of the terms of this Chapter;
      2.   That Permittee shall promptly pay all fines, penalties or other
assessments imposed upon Permittee by reason of Permittee's breach of any of
the terms of this Chapter;
      3.   That Permittee shall remedy any and all damage to streets, curbs,
gutters, water lines, fire hydrants and other City property, occasioned in any
manner by Permittee or its drilling, operation, and abandonment of said well;
      4.   That Permittee shall promptly fulfill all obligations under this
Chapter, and shall conduct the drilling operations in full conformance with the
requirements herein, including, but not limited to, abatement of dust and dirt,
removal of mud from public streets and thoroughfares, watering of non-paved
access roads, timely construction and erection of all fence structures as
required herein, and other similar terms;
      5.   That Permittee shall promptly clear all premises of all litter,
trash, waste and other substances used, allowed or occurring in the drilling or
producing operations, and shall, after abandonment, grade, level, and restore
said property in conformance with the City's drainage control ordinance;
      6.   That Permittee shall in all things fulfill the requirements of the
site plan, and if required, any reclamation or restoration of the site stated
as a condition of the issuance of the permit;
      7.   That Permittee shall indemnify and hold the City harmless from any
and all liability growing out of or attributable to the granting of this permit
or any of Permittee's actions with respect to the drilling, operation, and
abandonment of said well.
   e.   Reduction in principal amount.  If after completion of a well, the
Permittee has complied with all the provisions of this Chapter, such as
removing the derrick, clearing the premises, etc., the Permittee may apply to
the City to have the bond or other security reduced to a sum of not less than
ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the remainder of the time the well
produces; provided, however, that the Permittee has met all the requirements of
any permit hereunder, has otherwise acted in full compliance with this Chapter,
and provided that the Permittee shall submit a bond or certificate of deposit
in the correct principal amount and approved for form by the City Attorney, or
cash in lieu thereof, and otherwise in conformance with this section as a
substitute for any other security previously pledged under the provisions of
Subsection
20-32, save and except that no such substitute shall be taken for the five
thousand dollar ($5,000.00) cash bond until such time as otherwise specified in
this ordinance. Permittee may provide a blanket bond or certificate of deposit
in the approved form specified herein, or cash in lieu thereof, in the
principal amount of not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per well
secured by said security, to a maximum principal amount of said security of
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), said blanket security to secure all wells
operated by the Permittee within the City limits, provided said blanket
security is in a form acceptable to the City Attorney and otherwise conforms
with this section.
   f.   For each completed well covered by security under this section that
ceases to produce and is subsequently plugged and abandoned in accordance with
the requirements of the Railroad Commission, the security for said well shall
be returned to the principal or in the case of blanket security, said well
shall no longer require such security.  To qualify for release of security as
set out herein, the Permittee must provide copies of official Railroad
Commission forms verifying the plugging and abandonment of the well and must
remove all surface equipment used in the operation of the well including, but
not limited to, pumps, compressors, storage tanks, and separator tanks.
   g.   Violation of Conditions.  It shall be unlawful for the principal of any
bond filed in accordance with this section to violate any condition of such
bond. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-33. Insurance Required Prior to Drilling.
   a.   Generally.  In addition to the bond required by Sec.
20-32, each Permittee, prior to the issuance of the permit and commencement of
actual drilling operations, shall file with the City Engineer a certificate(s)
of insurance showing that the Permittee has in full force and effect a policy
or policies of standard comprehensive public liability insurance, including
contractual liability covering bodily injuries and property damage, naming the
Permittee and the City as co-insured, and issued by an insurance company
authorized to do business within the State of Texas. Such policy or policies,
in the aggregate shall provide for the following minimum coverage:
      1.   For bodily injury or death, five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000.00) as to any one person and one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) as
to any one accident.
      2.   For public liability for damage to property of others, five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000.00). 
   b.   In addition, prior to the issuance of the permit, Permittee shall file
with the City Engineer a certificate(s) of insurance showing that the Permittee
has in full force and effect a policy or policies of blowout or cost of well
control insurance in an amount not less than one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) for each well. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/
08)
Sec. 20-34. Notification of Issuance.
   Following the issuance of a permit as otherwise provided herein, the
applicant shall place a notification of such issuance in the legal notice
section of the local newspaper with the largest daily circulation in the City. 
Such notification shall be published no earlier than three (3) days following
the issuance of the permit and no later than five (5) days following the
issuance of the permit.  Said notification shall state with particularity the
name of the Permittee; the designated name of the well; the well location,
identified by streets and other readily identifiable landmarks sufficient to
inform the reader as to the exact location of the well; the anticipated date
for drilling activity to begin; and any other specific information required to
be published by the City. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-35. Permit Term; If production will continue.
   Each permit  shall have an initial term of one (1) year from the date of
issuance; provided, two (2) time extensions of ninety (90) days each may be
granted at the end of the original term, and provided the Permittee can make a
showing of good cause for the delay as a precondition for approval of any
extension. The City Manager or duly authorized designee shall determine the
appropriateness of any permit  extension.  It shall be the responsibility of
the Permittee to file any requests for extension at least five (5) days in
advance of the expiration date of the then-outstanding term.  At the end of the
initial term, or any extended term not to exceed a total of eighteen (18)
months, the permit shall expire unless the Permittee is engaged in drilling or
completion operations.  Any decision not to grant a permit extension as
provided herein may be appealed by the Permittee to City Council, which such
decision shall be final.  If production occurs during the permit term, then the
permit shall continue with an indefinite term until production ceases and the
well has been plugged and abandoned and in accordance with Division F. (Ord.
No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-36. Completion of Well.
   Upon completion of the well, including performance of all production tests
required by the Texas Railroad Commission as a precondition to issuance of a
production allowable, the Permittee shall verbally notify the City Engineer as
soon as possible thereafter, and shall formally certify completion of the well
to the City by filing duplicates of Railroad Commission-required completion
forms G-1 (gas well) or W-2 (oil well), or their successor forms, with the City
within ten (10) days following the filing of same with the Railroad Commission.
(Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-37. Refusal or Withdrawal of Permit; Processing Fee.
   If the permit for the well is refused, or if the applicant notifies the City
in writing that the applicant does not elect to accept the permit as tendered
and wishes to withdraw the application, or if the bond of the applicant is not
approved, or if the applicant notifies the City in writing that the applicant
wishes to withdraw the application for bond, or if following the issuance of
the permit, the Permittee determines that drilling of the well is no longer
feasible or possible, and the Permittee has undertaken no substantive activity
in drilling the well to date, then the cash deposit filed by the applicant with
the application shall be returned to the applicant, except there shall be
retained therefrom by the City one hundred dollars ($100.00) as a processing
fee. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-38. Transfer of Permit.
   Upon application for transfer of permit duly presented to the City Engineer,
and upon stipulation in writing by the applicant for transfer to assume all
obligations of the current Permittee, including satisfactory security, bonds,
and insurance, and upon a showing that the applicant for transfer would have
otherwise been qualified for issuance of the original permit, a permit may be
transferred into the name of a new Permittee.  A permit transfer fee of two
hundred dollars ($200.00) must accompany all applications for transfer. 
Transfer of a permit shall not extend the term of the original permit or affect
any other substantive requirements therein. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-
2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-39. Termination.
   When a permit has been issued under this Chapter, the same shall terminate
and become inoperative without any action on the part of the City, unless,
within the original term or extended term as set out in Sec.
20-35, actual drilling of the well commenced.  Cessation of drilling operations
for more than six (6) months shall operate to terminate and cancel the permit,
and the well shall be considered as abandoned for all purposes of this Chapter.
(Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-40. Supplemental Permit for Deepening Well.
   Once any well has either been completed as a producer or abandoned as a dry
hole, it shall be unlawful for any person to drill such well to a deeper depth
than that reached in the prior drilling operations without obtaining a
supplemental permit for deepening the well.  To receive a supplemental permit,
the operator shall file a supplemental application with the City Engineer
specifying:
   1.   The then-condition of the well and the casing therein;
   2.   The depth to which it proposed such well be deepened;
   3.   The proposed casing program to be used in connection with the proposed
deepening operation; and,
   4.   Evidence of adequate current tests showing that the casing strings in
the well meet or exceed all regulatory requirements of the Railroad
Commission. 
   If the City Engineer and either the City Manager or the City Council, is
satisfied that the well may be deepened with the same degree of safety as
existed in the original well, a supplemental permit may be issued without
additional filing fee to the Permittee authorizing the deepening and operation
of the well to such specified depth.  In any deeper drilling or any deeper
completion of any deeper producing operations, the Permittee shall comply with
all other provisions contained in this Chapter and the original permit
applicable to the drilling, completion, and operation of a well. (Ord. No. 0-
2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)

DIVISION C  LEVEL A PERMITS
Sec. 20-52. Permit Defined.
   a.   Upon receipt of a permit application, the City Engineer shall determine
if the application will qualify for a permit issued under this Division.
   b.   A permit issued under this Division shall be designated a Level A
Permit.  A well must satisfy all of the following criteria to be considered for
a Level A Permit:
      1.   Proposed well location must be in a primarily rural, open area;
      2.   Proposed well location must have less than five (5) habitable
structures within a five hundred foot (500') distance of the wellhead;
      3.   Proposed well location may not be within a five hundred foot (500')

      4.   Proposed well location is not in a City park;
      5.   Proposed well must not penetrate a potential sour gas formation as
defined by the Texas Railroad Commission;
      6.   Proposed well location must be out of the 100-year floodplain;
      7.   Proposed well will not be drilled to a formation at a true vertical
depth in excess of twenty thousand feet (20,000').
      8.   If the proposed well location required the approval of adjacent
surface property owners as provided in Sec.
20-31, the applicant has acquired 100% of the required approvals. (Ord. No. 0-
2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-53. Application Requirements.
   An application for a Level A Permit satisfying all the criteria set out in
Sec.
20-52 shall include the following information:
      1.   Information satisfying all the requirements of Sec.
20-30 of this Chapter;
      2.   A minimum site plan;
      3.   Any other information required by the City Engineer to assure
compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00)
(0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-54. Permitting Procedure.
   a.   The applicant shall cooperate fully with the City Engineer in providing
the information necessary to complete the permit application.  Upon completion
of the review of the permit application, the City Engineer shall make a
recommendation to the City Manager as to whether a Level A Permit should
issue.  If the City Manager determines that the application complies in all
respects with the provisions of this Chapter, the City Manager shall issue a
permit for the drilling and operation of the well. In making this
determination, the City Manager may request the recommendation of the Oil & Gas
Advisory Board.
   b.   The City Manager shall act on an application for a Level A Permit
within thirty (30) days after all information required for issuance of the
permit has been filed with the City Engineer, provided that an additional
thirty (30) days is permissible if the City Manager has requested
recommendation of the Oil and Gas Advisory Board.  The thirty (30) day review
period shall not begin to run until the applicant has provided the City
Engineer with a complete application package, including satisfaction of the
requirements of Sec.
20.29 of this Chapter regarding timely posting of the required notice sign.
   c.   In reviewing the permit application, the City Engineer and the City
Manager may consider the past performance of the applicant in compliance with
City ordinances regulating oil and gas drilling activity.  Should the applicant
have a history of poor compliance, such that the City Manager believes that a
subsequent permit would necessitate a more intense site plan, additional
conditions, or other similar requirements, then the City Manager may, within
ten (10) days of receipt of a completed application, determine that the pending
application should require a Level B or Level C Permit.  On receiving
notification of this determination, the applicant may request a recommendation
of the Oil & Gas Advisory Board.  Processing of the application will be abated
for thirty (30) days pending consideration by the Oil and Gas Advisory Board.
The recommendation of the Board will be made to the City Manager and applicant,
at which time the City Manager may decide to uphold the decision to require
processing at Level B or C or whether to complete the processing at Level A. 
Thereafter, the permit shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of
this Chapter regarding issuance of such permits; the time period for issuance
of such permits shall begin on the date of the City Manager's recommendation or
the date of perfection of a permit application for the recommended permit,
whichever date shall occur later.
   d.   Based on the applicant's prior compliance, the City Manager may also
require as a condition of issuance of the permit increased security or
insurance coverage in excess of that specified in Sec.
20-32 and Sec.
20-33.
   e.   The City Manager may impose any special conditions in the permit
reasonably appropriate to achieve the purposes of this ordinance and to protect
the public health, safety, and welfare.
   f.   The City Manager, upon a finding that the application fails to comply
with the requirements of this Chapter or should not be approved for the reasons
stated in Sections
20-32 and
20-33, may deny the permit. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-55. Permit Conditions.
   a.   Each Level A Permit issued under this Division shall include the
following:
      1.   By reference have incorporated therein all the provisions of this
Chapter with the same force and effect as if this Chapter were copied verbatim
in the permit.
      2.   Specify the well location with particularity to lot number, block
number, name of addition or subdivision, or other available correct legal
description, as indicated on the minimum site plan; provided, however, the
exact wellhead location for a Level A Permit may vary by twenty feet (20') in
either direction from the originally indicated survey point as long as such
variance does not require the approval of adjacent property owners as set out
in Sec.
20-31.  If the site location does vary from that originally presented to the
City Engineer, the Permittee shall upon completion of the well file with the
City Engineer a revised site plan indicating the actual location of the
wellhead.
      3.   Specify the term of the permit in conformance with Sec.
20-35.
      4.   Specify minimum driveway requirements in conformance with Sec.
20-32.
      5.   Specify the total depth to which the well may be drilled, not
exceeding the projected depth.
      6.   Specify that no actual operations shall be commenced until the
Permittee shall file and have approved security in the designated principal
amount set out in the permit and conditioned as specified in Sec.
20-32. 
      7.   Specify such conditions as are by this Chapter authorized or as are
required by the City Manager.
   b.   The permit shall be in duplicate originals signed by the City Manager,
and prior to delivery to the Permittee, shall be signed by the Permittee with
one original to be retained by the City and one by the Permittee.  When so
signed such permit shall constitute the Permittee's drilling and operating
license and a contractual obligation of the Permittee to comply with the terms
of such permit, such bond, and this Chapter. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-
2008-45, 3/26/08)
Sec. 20-56.    Appeal by Permit Applicant.
   The actions of the City Manager in imposing additional conditions in excess
of the minimum conditions required under this Chapter for the issuance of the
permit, or the City Manager's denial of the permit application, may be appealed
by the permit applicant in public session to the City Council. If an appeal is
perfected in accordance with this Section, the permit application, additional
conditions received by the City Manager or denial of application shall be
forwarded to the Oil and Gas Advisory Board.  Within 30 days after receiving
the application and conditions, the Oil and Gas Advisory Board shall forward
its recommendations, along with the application and conditions to the City
Council.  In considering the appeal, the burden of proof shall be upon the
applicant. Following the appeal, the City Council may sustain the action of the
City Manager, reverse same, or impose additional requirements as conditions for
issuance of the permit as provided in Sec.
20-70 of this Chapter. The City Council shall have an additional thirty (30)
days from the date of filing an appeal to render its decision, which shall be
final. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)

Sec. 20-70. Permitting Procedure.
   a.   The applicant shall cooperate fully with the City Engineer in providing
all information necessary to complete the permit application.  Upon completion
of the review of the permit application, the City Engineer shall make a
recommendation to the City Manager as to whether a Level B Permit should
issue.  If the City Manager determines that the applicant complies with the
provisions of this Chapter, the City Manager shall issue a permit for the
drilling and operation of the well.  In making this determination, the City
Manager may request the recommendation of the Oil & Gas Advisory Board.
   b.   The City Manager shall act on an application for a Level B Permit
within thirty (30) days after all information required for issuance of the
permit has been filed with the City Engineer provided that an additional thirty
(30) days is permissible if the City Manager has requested recommendation of
the Oil and Gas Advisory Board.  The thirty (30) day review period shall not
begin to run until the applicant has provided the City Engineer with a complete
application package, including satisfaction of the requirements of Sec.
20-29 regarding timely posting of the required notice sign.
   c.   In reviewing the permit application, the City Engineer and the City
Manager may consider the past performance of the applicant in compliance with
city ordinances regulating oil and gas drilling activity.  Should the applicant
have a history of poor compliance, such that the City Manager believes that a
subsequent permit requires a more intensive site plan, additional conditions,
or other similar requirements, then the City Manager may, within ten (10) days
of receipt of a completed application, determine that the pending application
should require a Level C Permit. On receiving notification of this
determination, the applicant may request a recommendation of the Oil & Gas
Advisory Board Processing of the application will be abated for thirty (30)
days pending consideration by the Oil and Gas Advisory Board.  Thereafter, the
permit shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter
regarding issuance of such permit; the time period for issuance of such a
permit shall begin on the date of the City Manager's recommendation or the date
of perfection of a permit application for the recommended permit, whichever
date shall occur later.
   d.   Based on the applicant's prior history, the City Manager may also
require as a condition of issuance of the permit increased security or
insurance coverage in excess of that specified in Sec.
20-32 and Sec.
20-33. 
   e.   The City Manager may impose any special conditions in the permit
reasonably considered appropriate to achieve the purposes of this ordinance and
to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
   f.   The City Manager, upon a finding that the application fails to comply
with the requirements of this Chapter, including especially Secs.
20-32 and Sec.
20-33 regarding security and insurance, may deny the permit. (Ord. No. 0-2000-
86, 11/1/00) (0-2008-45, 3/26/08)

20-32. 
      9.   Specify such conditions as are by this Chapter authorized or as are
required by the City Manager.
   b.   The permit shall be in duplicate originals signed by the City Manager,
and prior to delivery to the Permittee, shall be signed by the Permittee with
one original to be retained by the City and one by the Permittee.  When so
signed such permit shall constitute the Permittee's drilling and operating
license and a contractual obligation of the Permittee to comply with the terms
of such permit, such bond, and this Chapter. (Ord. No. 0-2000-86, 11/1/00) (0-
