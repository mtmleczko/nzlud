PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Castroville, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Charles Vignos, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to the Honorable Ron McPherson, Mayor, Mr. Watt Murrah, City Attorney, and Ms. Joyce Hutzler, City Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-5. - Public contact/media relations. 
    Representative government is only successful when citizens are kept informed and educated about the issues facing their city; consequently, it is imperative that the media play an important role in the council and public relations. It is through an informed public that progress is ensured and good government remains sensitive to its constituents.

It is council's desire to establish a professional working relationship to help maintain a well informed and educated citizenry.

(b)  In order to ensure city staff is able to properly address council agenda items, councilmember questions should be, whenever possible, presented to the city administrator for consideration at least four workdays prior to the next scheduled council meeting. This allows time for staff to diligently address councilmembers' concerns and provide them with an adequate response. If staff is unable to address the agenda item at the council meeting, the city administrator will so notify the councilmember as soon as possible and advise when an answer will be forthcoming. 
(c)  Enhancing a steady exchange of information between city staff and council is a high priority in maintaining a streamlined and efficient government. To ensure a well informed council, the city administrator or his designee will provide regular and timely informational updates on city operational and maintenance issues that may be of interest to council. When appropriate, the mayor or city administrator will provide notice to councilmembers regarding meetings hosted by other groups or organizations where councilmember attendance would be beneficial to the city; no city business will be conducted and the city secretary will publish a notice of possible quorum when necessary. For purely social events, conferences, and conventions, councilmembers may attend without the need for publishing a notice of possible quorum; no city business may be discussed at these functions.

DIVISION 3. - FUND BALANCE POLICY 

Sec. 2-133. - Background. 
(a)  In February 2009, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) issued GASB Statement 54 "Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions," which was effective for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011. The statement substantially changes how fund balances are categorized. GASB Statement 54 is intended to improve the usefulness of the amount reported in fund balance by providing more structured classifications. 
(b)  The statement applies to fund balance reported in the governmental funds and does not apply to enterprise funds or internal service funds. Previously fund balance was classified as "reserved" or "unreserved." Unreserved fund balance may be further allocated into designated and undesignated. 
(Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 8-20-2012) 
Sec. 2-134. - Purpose. 
    The city sets guidelines for fund balance. The fund balance addressed in this policy only applies to unrestricted fund balance. The policy establishes the appropriate size of fund balance, replenishing or setting aside resources for fund balance, and the methods for utilizing fund balance. This fund balance policy, as presented to city council and the citizens, was established by the city finance department to maintain good standing with rating agencies, mitigate current and future risks against revenue shortfalls or unanticipated expenditures and to ensure stable tax rates. 
(Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 8-20-2012) 
Sec. 2-135. - Classifications of fund balance. 
    A fund's equity - commonly referred to as "fund balance" - is generally the difference between its assets and its liabilities. Fund balance will be displayed in the following classifications depicting the relative strength of the spending constraints placed on the purposes for which resources can be used: 
(1)  Nonspendable fund balance - amounts that are not in a spendable form (such as inventory, prepaid expenses, and long term receivables (unless the proceeds are restricted, committed, or assigned) or are required to be maintained intact (such as the corpus of a trust fund or debt service reserve fund). 
(2)  Restricted fund balance - amounts constrained to specific purposes by their providers (such as grantors, bond covenants, and higher levels of government) through constitutional provisions or by enabling legislation. 
(3)  Committed fund balance - amounts constrained to specific purposes by the government itself. This requires a formal action by the city council. Commitments may be changed or lifted only by the city council taking the same formal action that imposed the constraint originally. 
(4)  Assigned fund balance - amounts intended to be used by the city for specific purposes. Intent can be expressed by the city council or by an official or body to whom the city council delegates the authority. In governmental funds other than the general fund, assigned fund balance represents the amount that is not restricted or committed. This indicates that resources in other governmental funds are, at a minimum, intended to be used for the purpose of that fund. 
(5)  Unassigned fund balance - amounts available for any purpose. These amounts are only shown in the general fund except in cases of negative fund balances in other governmental funds. 
(Ord. No. 2012-10, § 1, 8-20-2012) 
Sec. 2-136. - Classifying residual fund balance. 
(a)  When both restricted and unrestricted funds are available for expenditure, restricted funds are used first. Within unrestricted funds, assume committed resources are used first, then assigned, then unassigned. 
(b)  Unassigned fund balance - amounts available for any purpose. These amounts are only shown in the general fund except in cases of negative fund balances in other governmental funds.

(Ord. No. 245, § 6, 12-15-92) 
Sec. 18-106. - Permits; variance. 
(a)  Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, no structure shall be erected in excess of the excepted height limitation allowed in section 18-103(b), unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the height of the structure for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to allow it to be determined whether the resulting structure would conform to the regulations prescribed in this article. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for height inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with section 18-106(d). 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(2)  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or alteration of any structure in excess of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in section 18-103(b). 
(b)  Existing uses. Except as stated in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, no permit shall be granted that would allow any structure to be made or become higher than it was on the effective date of Ordinance No. 245 or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Unless a variance is required as indicated in subsection (d) of this section, all applications for such permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the city administrator, as approved by the commissioners court of the county, determines that a nonconforming structure within the boundaries of the zoned area has been abandoned for a period of more than six months, starting from the first day of notice by mail and by publication, or more than 80 percent torn down, except by an act of God, deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations, unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure in violation of the regulations prescribed in this article may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from the regulations in question. Applications for permits shall be made to the city administrator upon a form published for that purpose. Applications required by this article are to be submitted to the city administrator, who will see that the application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Applications for variance shall be made to the board of adjustment by the city administrator, who shall forthwith transmit such application to the board of adjustment for determination. Such variance shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations set out in this article will result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the municipal airport advisory board for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the municipal airport advisory board does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny such application. In no case shall the entire process take more than 60 days for approval or denial of such application. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance issued under this article may, if such action is deemed advisable by the city administrator or the board of adjustment to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure in question to allow the city administrator to install, operate and maintain, at the expense of the city, such markings and lights as may be necessary.

( Ord. No. 2016-001, § 10.01, 9-22-15 ) 
Sec. 24-92. - Variance considerations. 
    When considering granting a variance in accordance with this section, the following considerations may be considered by P&Z and the city council.

b.  Hardship claim based on the exceptional topographic conditions or physical features uniquely affecting the property on which a sign is to be located. 
c.  The P&Z may take into consideration the demonstrated and documented correlation between the variance and protecting the public health and safety. The city staff will be more inclined to consider a variance request when it is sought during an earlier stage of the construction approval process, for instance when the responsible party is submitting/obtaining a plat, planned development district, development agreement, or site plan. 
(2)  Monetary consideration: A showing that the display of a sign would be more profitable or the sign would be more valuable is not a special or unique hardship as required by this section. 
(3)  Recommendations and approvals: Nothing herein shall preclude the P&Z from recommending or the city council from approving, or require the P&Z to recommend or the city council to approve, the granting of any variance. 
(4)  Conditions: The P&Z may recommend, and city council may impose, conditions upon the granting of a variance under this section. Such conditions must be related to the variance sought, and be generally intended to mitigate the adverse effects of the sign on neighboring tracts and the general aesthetic ambiance of the community. A responsible party's failure to comply with conditions placed on a variance may result in the city council voiding the variance and authorizing all available code enforcement actions and other remedies available in equity or at law. 
(5)  Bases of decision: The recommendations and decisions of approval or denial of variance requests considered by the P&Z and the city council shall be in writing.

If an un-maintained or un-repaired sign is removed by the city and the sign remains unclaimed for a period of more than 30 days, the city may destroy, sell, or otherwise dispose of the sign. 
(c)  Removal of hazardous signs: Any sign which in the judgment of the city staff has become an imminent hazard to public safety, either because of an incident of damage or because of neglect of maintenance, shall be repaired or removed by the responsible party without delay. Notice of the existence of the hazard shall specify the maximum time which may be allowed for repairs or removal in order to insure public safety, and the notice may be served upon the responsible party by certified mail.

(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.08, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-9. - Service units. 
(a)  Service units are established in accordance with generally accepted engineering and planning standards. 
(b)  Service units shall be calculated based on living units equivalent as determined by the size of the water meter(s) for the development; or alternatively, as approved the city as a result of an engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering services in the State of Texas, which demonstrates that the number of LUEs of service for the new development will be different than those indicated by the size of the water meter. 
(c)  If the city determines that the water pressure in the city's transmission main is significantly higher or lower than standard pressure such that the size of the water meter is not indicative of actual service demand, the city may adjust the number of LUEs based on a smaller or larger sized meter which more accurately reflects the flow rate and the system pressure conditions. 
(d)  If a fire demand meter (tap) is purchased for a property, the meter size utilized to calculate the number of LUEs shall be the dimension of the portion of the fire demand meter which reflects the meter size which would provide only domestic service to the property. Said reduced meter size shall then be utilized to calculate the number of LUEs. 
(1)  The meter types used to calculate the number of LUEs shall be either simple or compound meters. 
(2)  If the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the then-owner of the property shall be assessed the then-current fee for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity. 
(3)  To avoid the use of fire flow volumes for domestic usage, the owner of any property for which a fire demand meter is purchased shall be required to execute a restrictive covenant on a form approved by the city, which covenant shall acknowledge the right of the city to assess such fees to subsequent owners of the property. Said covenant shall be executed prior to the purchase of the fire demand meter and shall be filed in the deed records of the county. 
(4)  No fees shall be collected for the purchase of taps which shall be utilized to provide only fire protection capacity. 
(e)  Upon wastewater tap purchase for lots for which no water meter has been purchased, service units shall be established by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Texas, shall be reviewed by the city and shall be presented to the city administrator, which shall designate the appropriate number of service units. 
(f)  The city council may revise the service unit designation from time to time according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.09, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-10. - Impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  The maximum impact fee per service unit for each service area shall be computed by dividing the growth-related capital construction cost of service in the service area identified in the capital improvements plan for that category of capital improvements, by the total number of projected service units anticipated within the service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development, based on the land use assumptions for that service area, and adjusted by subtracting credits in the form of future rate or tax contributions to water and/or wastewater CIP funding. Maximum impact fees per service unit for each service area shall be established by category of capital improvements and shall be set forth in Exhibit C. 
(b)  Exhibit C may be amended by the city council according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors. 
(c)  The effective impact fees per service unit may be amended from time to time by the city council through ordinance amendment to any amount equal to or less than the maximum fees set forth in Exhibit C. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.10, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-11. - Assessment of impact fees. 
(a)  The approval of any subdivision of land or of any new development shall include as a condition the assessment of the impact fee applicable to such development. 
(b)  Assessment of the impact fee for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations following the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, assessment shall be at the time of final subdivision plat approval, and shall be the value of the maximum impact fee per service unit then in effect, as provided in Exhibit C, as set forth in section 34-10(c). The city may provide the subdivider with a copy of Exhibit C, prior to final subdivision plat approval, but such shall not constitute assessment within the meaning of this chapter. 
(2)  For new development which occurs or is proposed to occur without platting, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit, and shall be the value of the maximum impact fee per service unit set forth in Exhibit C. 
(3)  Fees shall not be assessed to property which has previously purchased taps for the property and which desires to exchange those purchased taps for taps which will reflect an equivalent number of LUEs, as determined under section 34-9. If the exchange of said taps will result in an increase in the number of LUEs, the purchaser shall be assessed the maximum impact fee in effect at the time of tap exchange, based on the additional LUEs required. 
(4)  Because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole, water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to collection of an impact fee. However, if the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the current owner of the property shall be assessed the impact fees currently in effect at the time such conversion is established by the city for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity. 
(c)  Following assessment of the impact fees pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, no additional impact fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases, as set forth under section 34-9. 
(d)  Following the lapse or expiration of approval for a plat, a new assessment must be performed at the time a new application for such development is filed. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.11, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-12. - Calculation of impact fees. 
(a)  Following the request for new development as provided in section 34-11, the city shall compute maximum impact fees due for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The total service units for the new development shall be multiplied by the appropriate per-unit maximum fee value determined as set forth in section 34-10; and 
(2)  Fee offsets shall be subtracted as determined by the process proscribed in section 34-14. 
(b)  The value of each impact fee due for a new development shall not exceed a value computed by multiplying the effective fee assessed per service unit pursuant to section 34-10 by the number of service units generated by the development. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.12, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-13. - Collection of impact fees. 
(a)  No water or wastewater tap or building permit shall be issued until all impact fees have been paid to the city, or until a "notice of impact fee due" is recorded as provided in this section, except as provided otherwise by contract. 
(b)  Effective impact fees shall be paid at the time of the issuance of a building permit, except as provided in subsections (c) through (e) of this section. 
(c)  For land platted outside the corporate boundaries of the city, effective fees shall be collected at the time an application for connection to the city's water or wastewater system is filed. 
(d)  If the city lacks authority to issue building permits in the area where the impact fee applies, effective impact fees shall be collected at the time an application is filed for connection to the city's water or wastewater system. 
(e)  The city may, at its sole discretion, enter into contracts to establish a different date of fee collection than those provided in this section. 
(f)  It shall be the policy of the city to attempt to establish any contracts which in the future may be entered into for wholesale service, in such a manner that effective impact fees are collected from the wholesale customer according to the number of LUEs attributable to each retail meter for new development within the wholesale customer's service area. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.13, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-14. - Offsets against impact fees. 
(a)  The city shall offset the present value of any system-related facilities, pursuant to rules established in this section, which have been dedicated to the city by the feepayer, and have been received by the city, including the value of rights-of-way or capital improvements constructed pursuant to an agreement with the city, against the value of the impact fees due for that category of capital improvement. 
(b)  All offsets against impact fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this chapter and additional standards promulgated by the city, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines. 
(1)  No offset shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  The unit costs used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the capital improvements plan for the category of facility within the service area for which the impact fee is imposed. 
(3)  If an offset applicable to a plat has not been exhausted within ten years from the date of the issuance of the first building permit after the effective date of this ordinance or within such period as may be otherwise designated by contract, such offset shall lapse. 
(4)  In no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer for an offset when no impact fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to this chapter or for any value exceeding the total impact fees due for the development for that category of capital improvement, unless otherwise agreed to by the city. 
(c)  An applicant for new development must apply for an offset against impact fees due for the development either at or before the time of plat recordation. The applicant shall file a petition for offsets with the city on a form provided for such purpose. The contents of the petition shall be established by administrative guidelines. The city must provide the applicant, in writing, with a decision on the offset request, including the reasons for the decision. The decision shall specify the maximum value of the offset which may be applied against an impact fee, which value and the date of the determination shall be associated with the plat for the new development. 
(d)  The available offset associated with the plat shall be applied against an impact fee in the following manner: 
(1)  Such offset shall be prorated equally among all service units, as calculated in section 34-9, and remain applicable to such service units, to be applied at time of filing and acceptance of an application for a building permit, against impact fees due. 
(2)  If the total number of service units used by the city in the original offset calculation described in (1) is eventually exceeded by the number of total service units realized by the actual development, the city may, at its sole discretion, collect the full impact fee exclusive of any associated offset for the excess service units. 
(3)  At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative offset agreements upon petition by the owner in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.14, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-15. - Establishment of accounts and records. 
(a)  The city shall establish separate interest-bearing accounts, in a bank authorized to receive deposits of city funds, for each major category of capital facility for which an impact fee is imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  Interest earned by each account shall be credited to that account and shall be used solely for the purposes specified for funds authorized in section 34-16. 
(c)  The city shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to ensure that impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the purposes authorized in section 34-16. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this chapter; provided, however, that any fee paid shall be expended within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed ten years from the date the fee is deposited into the account. 
(d)  The city shall maintain and keep adequate financial records for each such account, which shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues, which shall account for all monies received, and which shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from each account shall be used solely and exclusively for the provision of uses specified in the capital improvements program as system-related facilities. The city shall also maintain such records as are necessary to ensure that refunds are appropriately made under the provision in section 34-18, and such other information as may be necessary for the proper implementation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.15, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-16. - Use of proceeds of impact fee accounts. 
(a)  The impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter may be used to finance or to recoup capital construction costs of service. Impact fees may also be used to retire bonds or to pay the principal sum and interest and other finance costs on bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance such capital construction costs of service. 
(b)  Impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall not be used to pay for any of the following expenses: 
(1)  Construction, acquisition or expansion of capital improvements or assets other than those identified in the associated capital improvements plans; 
(2)  Repair, operation, or maintenance of existing or new capital improvements or facilities expansions; 
(3)  Upgrading, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements to serve existing development in order to meet stricter safety, efficiency, environmental or regulatory standards; 
(4)  Upgrading, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements to provide better service to existing development; provided however, that impact fees may be used to pay the costs of upgrading, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements in order to meet the need for new capital improvements generated by new development; or 
(5)  Administrative and operating costs of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.16, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-17. - Appeals. 
(a)  The property owner or applicant for new development may appeal the following decisions to the city council: 
(1)  The applicability of an impact fee to the development; 
(2)  The basis for fee calculation; 
(3)  The availability or the value of an offset; 
(4)  The application of an offset against an impact fee due; 
(5)  The amount of the refund due, if any. 
(b)  The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the value of the fee or the value of the offset was not calculated according to the applicable impact fee schedule or the guidelines established for determining offsets. 
(c)  The appellant must file a notice of appeal with the city administrator within 30 days following the application of impact fees at the time of building permit issuance, or for properties where the city does not issue building permits, or for properties where new development occurs without the issuance of a building permit, within 30 days following the application of impact fees at the time of tap purchase. If the appeal application is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the city administrator in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact fee due, the development application or tap purchase or building permit application may be processed while the appeal is pending. 
(d)  The appellant may appeal the decision of the city administrator to the city council. A notice of appeal to the council must be filed by the applicant with the city secretary within 30 days following the city administrator's decision. If the notice of appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the city attorney in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact fee due, the development application or tap purchase or building permit issuance may be processed while the appeal is pending. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.17, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-18. - Refunds. 
(a)  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to this chapter which has not been expended within ten years from the date of payment, shall be refunded, upon application, to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid, or, if the impact fee was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in Article 1.03, Title 79, Revised Statutes (Article 5069-1.03, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), or any successor statute. 
(b)  An impact fee collected pursuant to this chapter shall be considered expended if the total expenditures for capital improvements or facilities expansions authorized in section 34-16 within ten years following the date of payment exceed the total fees collected for such improvements or expansions during such period. 
(c)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the city shall pro-rate the same by dividing the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner or governmental entity shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(d)  Upon the request of an owner of the property on which an impact fee has been paid, the city shall refund such fees if: 
(1)  Existing service is available and service is denied; or 
(2)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and the city has failed to commence construction of facilities to provide service within two years of fee payment; or 
(3)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and has not subsequently been made available within a reasonable period of time considering the type of capital improvement or facility expansion to be constructed, but in any event later than five years from the date of fee payment. 
(e)  The city shall refund an appropriate proportion of impact fee payments in the event that a previously purchased unused water meter is replaced with a smaller meter, based on the LUE differential of the two meter sizes and the per-LUE fee at the time of the original fee payment, less an administrative charge as established by the city. 
(f)  Petition for refunds shall be submitted to the city on a form provided by the city for such purpose. Within one month of the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the city must provide the petitioner, in writing, with a decision on the refund request, including the reasons for the decision. If a refund is due to the petitioner, the city administrator shall cause a refund payment be made to the petitioner.

(c)  The council shall adopt procedural rules for the committee to follow in carrying out its duties. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.20, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-21. - Agreement for capital improvements. 
    The city council may approve the owner of a new development to construct or finance some of the public improvements identified in the CIP. In the case of such approval, the property owner must enter into an agreement with the city prior to fee collection. The agreement shall be on a form approved by the city, and shall establish the estimated cost of improvement, the schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement, a requirement that the improvement shall be completed to city standards, and any other terms and conditions the city deems necessary. The city administrator or his/her designee shall review the improvement plan, verify costs and time schedules, determine if the improvement is contained in the CIP, and determine the amount of the applicable offset for such improvement to be applied to the otherwise applicable impact fee before submitting the proposed agreement to the council for approval.

(b)  Except as herein otherwise provided, the assessment and collection of an impact fee shall be additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other tax, fee, charge or assessment which is lawfully imposed on and due against the property. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.22, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-23. - Impact fees as additional and supplemental regulation. 
(a)  Impact fees established by this chapter are additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the city on the development of land or the issuance of building permits or the sale of water or wastewater taps or the issuance of certificates of occupancy. Such fees are intended to be consistent with and to further the policies of city's comprehensive plan, capital improvements plan, zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations and other city policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the city seeks to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities in conjunction with the development of land. 
(b)  This chapter shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density of development, design, and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of public improvements subject to the zoning and subdivision regulations or other regulations of the city, which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development. 
(Ord. No. 2011-005, § 1.23, 2-21-11) 
Sec. 34-24. - Relief procedures. 
    Any person who has paid an impact fee or an owner of land upon which an impact fee has been paid may petition the city council to determine whether any duty required by this chapter has not been performed within the time so prescribed. The petition shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the unperformed duty and request that the act be performed within 60 days of the request.

Sec. 46-36. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, unless the context clearly indicates another meaning: 
    Daytime hours shall mean the hours from 7:00 a.m. on one day and 10:00 p.m. the same day for residential properties or areas and 6:00 a.m. on one day and midnight on the same day for nonresidential properties or areas. 
    dB(A) shall mean the intensity of a sound expressed in decibels. 
    Emergency shall mean any occurrence or set of circumstances involving actual or imminent physical trauma or property damage or loss that demands immediate action. 
    Emergency work shall mean any work performed for the purpose of (i) preventing or alleviating the physical trauma or property damage threatened or caused by an emergency, (ii) restoring property to a safe condition following a fire, accident, or natural disaster, (iii) protecting persons or property from exposure to danger, or (iv) restoring public utilities.

(Ord. No. 2009-011, § 2 (2.01), 5-25-09) 
Sec. 46-37. - General prohibitions. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to make, continue, or cause to be made or continued any loud, unnecessary, or unusual noise that annoys, disturbs, injures, or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace, or safety of others. In determining whether a noise is loud, unnecessary, or unusual, the following factors shall be considered: time of day; whether the noise is recurrent, intermittent, or constant; the volume, frequency, and intensity; whether the noise has been enhanced in volume or range by any type of electronic or mechanical means; and whether the noise is subject to being controlled without unreasonable expense. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to make, assist in making, permit, continue, cause to be made or continued, or permit the continuance of any sound that either exceeds the maximum permitted sounds levels specified in section 46-41 of this article or, for purposes of sections 46-38, 46-39 and 46-40 of this article, otherwise unreasonably disturbs, injures, or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace, or safety of others.

(b)  No person shall operate the engine of any motor vehicle as defined by the Texas Transportation Code so as to "brake" or slow the same through the use of gears (commonly known as "jake braking") or by any other method which produces any noise in addition to the normal operating engine noise. 
(c)  No person shall operate or allow an engine of any sort of motor vehicle, except emergency equipment at any location or vehicles then located at a permitted public event or parade, to idle for more than one hour. 
(Ord. No. 2009-011, § 2 (2.03), 5-25-09) 
Sec. 46-39. - Amplified sound from vehicle. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to make, assist in making, permit, continue, cause to be made or continued, or permit the continuance of any sound using any sound amplifier that is part of or connected to any speaker system, radio, stereo receiver, compact disc player, cassette tape player, microphone, or any other sound source, when operated: (i) in such a manner as to disturb the peace, quiet, and comfort of the neighboring inhabitants, or (ii) at any time with louder volume than is necessary for convenient hearing for persons who are in the vehicle or within the property or premises in which such sound amplifier is operated and who are voluntary listeners thereto. The operation of any such sound amplifier in such a manner as to be plainly audible at a distance of 50 feet or more from a vehicle shall be presumed to be violative of this section. The operation of any such sound amplifier in such a manner that bass sounds are plainly audible at a distance of 50 feet or more from the property line of a property or premises in which the amplification is located shall be presumed to be violative of this section. In the event the property line where the vehicle is located is less than 50 feet from a residential property or area, then the perimeter of the residence nearest the sound source shall be the point the reading is taken. 
(b)  It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that the sound source is a motor vehicle and that (i) the motor vehicle is a mobile sound stage or studio that is being used on a stationary basis at a location not situated upon any street for the purpose of providing sound, during daytime hours, for an event or function and (ii) the use is in compliance with all other provisions of this article.

(b)  In any prosecution for a violation of this section, the fact that any loud animal noise which disturbed any person and which occurs in a residential property or area either: 
(1)  During nighttime hours; or 
(2)  When none of the residents who reside at the place where the animal is being kept are at home; 
Shall create a rebuttable presumption that such noise was in violation of this section. 
(c)  In any prosecution for a violation of this section, the fact that any animal has been allowed or permitted to persistently and chronically violate this section, as demonstrated by the issuance of two or more citations and or the receipt of two or more complaints from more than one household within a two-month period shall create a rebuttable presumption that such noise was in violation of this section.

    Any sound that exceeds the dB(A) levels set forth in this section under the conditions and measurement criteria set forth in this article is a violation of this article. Evidence that an activity or sound source produces a sound that exceeds the dB(A) levels specified in this section shall be prima facie evidence of a sound nuisance that unreasonably disturbs, injures, or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace, or safety of others in violation of this article. 
(b)  Regardless of the measurable dB(A) level established above and measured as provided in section 46-42, below, the generator of any sound or vibrations of such a nature as to unreasonably disturb or interfere with the peace, comfort and repose of neighboring persons of ordinary sensibilities, unless a permit of variance is first obtained, shall also be prima facie evidence of a sound that unreasonably disturbs, injures, or endanger the comfort, repose, health, peace, or safety of others in violation of this article. In the event there is less than 50 feet from the property line where the sound being generated to a residential structure or open place of business the sound will be considered to be in violation of this article. 
(c)  No person shall use or cause to be used any loudspeaker, loudspeaker system, sound amplifier, or any other machine or device that produces, reproduces, or amplifies sound outside of buildings or other enclosed structures in a manner that exceeds the levels specified in this section. 
(Ord. No. 2009-011, § 2 (2.06), 5-25-09) 
Sec. 46-42. - Method of sound measurement. 
    Whenever portions of this chapter prohibit sound over a certain decibel limit, measurement shall be made with a Type 1 or Type 2 calibrated sound level meter. The meter shall be calibrated regularly to insure it meets required accuracy standards. The meter shall utilize the A-weighting scale and the slow meter response as specified by the American National Standards Association. Measurements recorded shall be taken so as to provide a proper representation of the sound being measured. The microphone of the meter shall be positioned so as not to create any unnatural enhancement or diminution of the measured sound. A windscreen for the microphone shall be used. Traffic, aircraft, and other transportation noise shall not be considered in taking measurements except where such background noise interferes with the noise being measured and cannot reasonably be distinguished from the primary noise. Measurements of sound generated shall be taken from the curb line of the nearest public street to the property where the sound is generated and taken toward the source of the sound. In the event that there is not at least 50 feet of distance from the building in which sound is being generated and from which sound is being measured, then measurements shall be taken from the street curb line opposite the said building of the nearest public street to the property where the sound is generated.

(a)  No person shall use or cause to be used a loudspeaker, loudspeaker system, sound amplifier, or any other machine or device that produces, reproduces, or amplifies sound outside buildings or other enclosed structures in a manner that exceeds the levels specified in section 46-41, without first obtaining a permit to do so. No permit is required for any use not exceeding the said permissible levels. The permit shall be granted only for the amplification of music or human speech, or both. The permit:

    Flood Insurance Study (FIS). See "Flood elevation study." 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".

For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this article. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided the relevant factors in section 54-63(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted in this section and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article (section 54-48). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that: 
a.  The criteria outlined in subsections (a) through (i) of this section are met; and 
b.  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(Ord. No. 2012-006, § 1(Exh. A), 3-26-12) 
Sec. 54-77. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in section 54-28, section 54-62(8) or section 54-78(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in section 54-63(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection.

b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. (iii) Meet the permit requirements of section 54-63(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section.

(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions which are greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 54-28 or section 54-62(8). 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2012-006, § 1(Exh. A), 3-26-12) 
Sec. 54-79. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-28 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by pending or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified; or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 54-63(a)(1), are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2012-006, § 1(Exh. A), 3-26-12) 
Sec. 54-80. - Standards for floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-28 are areas designated as flood ways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:

(3)  During or after the investigation, but subsequent to the mailing of the notice of complaint, the director shall, if it appears that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is threatening to occur, attempt by informal endeavors to effect conciliation, including voluntary discontinuance of the discriminatory housing practice and to obtain adequate assurance of future voluntary compliance with provisions of this chapter. Nothing said or done in the course of such informal endeavors may be made public by the director, the commission, the investigator, the conciliator, the charging party, or the respondent, or be used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without the written consent of all persons concerned. 
(4)  Upon completion of an investigation where the director has made a determination that a discriminatory housing practice has in fact occurred, if the director is unable to secure from the respondent an acceptable conciliation agreement, then the human relations commission of the city must, upon a majority vote, refer the case to other agencies as appropriate. 
(d)  Penalty. If a discrimination housing practice is found to have in fact occurred and the case has been referred to municipal court, the respondent shall be assessed a penalty of not less than $300.00 per violation.

(1)  An employee of the city who is a member of the system may terminate employment and remain eligible to retire and receive a service retirement annuity at any time after that member attains an applicable age and service requirement, if that member has at least ten years of credited service performed for one or more municipalities that have authorized eligibility under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.202(c), or are subject to V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.102(e).

(3)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a service retirement annuity if the member has at least 25 years of credited service in that system performed for one or more municipalities that have participation dates after September 1, 1987, or have adopted a like provision under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.202(f).

If the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly during the lifetime of the surviving spouse in the amount that would have been payable to the surviving spouse had the member lived and retired at that date under an optional annuity described by V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.104(c)(1). 
(5)  At any time before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity, a surviving spouse to whom subsection (4) of this section applies may, upon written application filed with the system, receive payment of the accumulated contributions standing to the account of the member in lieu of any benefits otherwise payable under this section. If such a surviving spouse shall die before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section, the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be paid to the estate of such spouse. 
(6)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system and who performed service for this city prior to September 1, 1987 (for which service that employee did not receive credit with the system because the employee was not at that time a member of the system due to his age at the date of his employment), is hereby granted service credit with the system for all of such service (performed after the date of his latest employment by the city) that is prior to September 1, 1987, for which the employee has not previously received credit with the system, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Government Code § 852.105. 
(7)  The rights, credits and benefits authorized in this section shall be in addition to the plan provisions already adopted and in force at the effective date of Ordinance No. 227 pursuant to the TMRS Act.

(b)  The service credit hereby granted may be used only to satisfy length-of-service requirements for retirement eligibility, has no monetary value in computing the annuity payments allowable to the member, and may not be used in other computations, including computation of updated service credits.

(a)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the state municipal retirement system and who performed service as a probationary employee for this city prior to September 1, 1989, for which the employee did not receive credited service in the system because the person, as a probationary employee, was not enrolled as a member of the system during the period of probationary employment, is hereby allowed to obtain prior service credit for the period of such probationary service (not in excess of six months), pursuant to the provisions of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.304. 
(b)  As soon as practicable after the employee has filed a claim for the prior service credit under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.304, the city secretary shall, if he determines that such service was performed as claimed, verify the prior service allowable (not exceeding six months) and the average monthly compensation paid the member during the period of probationary employment, and shall certify to the board of trustees of the system the creditable prior service approved, and the average monthly compensation paid to the person by the city during the period of probationary employment.

Sec. 90-61. - Authorization of updated service credits. 
(a)  On the terms and conditions set out in V.T.C.A., Government Code §§ 853.401-853.404, as amended, each member of the system who has current service credit or prior service credit in the system in force and effect on January 1 of the calendar year preceding such allowance, by reason of service in the employment of the city, and on such date had at least 36 months of credited service with the system, shall be and is hereby allowed "updated service credit," as that term is defined in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.402(d). 
(b)  The updated service credit allowed and provided for under this section shall be 100 percent of the base updated service credit of the member, calculated as provided in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.402(c). If the city has previously adopted, or if it subsequently adopts, an ordinance authorizing updated service credit for unforfeited credit for prior service or current service with any other participating municipality, the calculations and adjustments set forth in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.601 shall apply to any such transferred service. 
(c)  Each updated service credit allowed under this section shall replace any updated service credit, prior service credit, special prior service credit, or antecedent service credit previously authorized for part of the same service. 
(d)  In accordance with the provisions of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.401(c), the deposits required to be made to the system by employees of the several participating departments on account of current service shall be calculated from and after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives on the full amount of such person's compensation as an employee of the city. 
(Ord. of 12-14-93, § 1) 
Sec. 90-62. - Increase in retirement annuities. 
(a)  On terms and conditions set out in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.203, the city hereby elects to allow and to provide for payment of the increases below stated in monthly benefits payable by the system to retired employees and to beneficiaries of deceased employees of the city under current service annuities and prior service annuities arising from service by such employees to the city. An annuity increased under this section replaces any annuity or increased annuity previously granted to the same person. 
(b)  The amount of the annuity increase under this section is computed as the sum of the prior service and current service annuities on the effective date of retirement of the person on whose service the annuities are based, multiplied by 70 percent of the percentage change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, from December of the year immediately preceding the effective date of the person's retirement to December 1992. 
(c)  An increase in an annuity that was reduced because of an option selection is reducible in the same proportion and in the same manner that the original annuity was reduced. 
(d)  If a computation under this section does not result in an increase in the amount of an annuity, the amount of the annuity will not be changed under this section. 
(e)  The amount by which an increase under this section exceeds all previously granted increases to an annuitant is an obligation of the city and of its account in the municipality accumulation fund of the system.

Sec. 99-13. - Preservation rate. 
(a)  Total inches method. Determine the total caliper inches of protected trees and heritage trees shown on the tree survey by calculating the sum total DBH inches. Calculate 40 percent of the total significant trees DBH and sixty (60) percent of the total heritage trees DBH of the total, that is the total inches that is required to be preserved. Application of the total inches method is exemplified as follows: 
Example 1: Total significant trees identified on the tree survey as large tree species DBH inches equals 50) DBH inches. The preservation rate is calculated by multiplying 40 percent to 500 which gives a product of 200 DBH inches. In that case 200 DBH inches of large tree species (significant tree category) must be preserved. Example 2: Total significant trees identified on the tree survey as small tree species DBH inches equals 1,000 DBH inches. The preservation rate is calculated by multiplying 40 percent to 1,000 which gives a product of 400 DBH inches. In that case 400 DBH inches of small tree species (significant tree category) must be preserved. Example 3: Total heritage trees identified on the tree survey as large tree species DBH inches equals 1,000 DBH inches. The preservation rate is calculated by multiplying 60 percent to 1,000 which gives a product of 600 DBH inches. In that case 600 DBH inches of large tree species (heritage tree category) must be preserved. Example 4: Total heritage trees identified on the tree survey as small tree species DBH inches equals 600 DBH inches. The preservation rate is calculated by multiplying 60 percent to 600 which gives a product of 360 DBH inches. In that case 360 DBH inches of small tree species (heritage tree category) must be preserved.

TABLE 3. 
TREE SURVEY MAP 
    The location of the protected trees located on the tree survey chart are to be shown on a tree survey map represented as a site plan denoting scale of map, cardinal directions, and numbers corresponding with protected trees on the site. For the purposes of this table it is assumed that three protected trees have been located on the property being surveyed. An example is illustrated below. 
EXHIBIT A 

(c)  The entire parcel being proposed for development shall be included in the tree survey, except for any portion located farther than fifty (50) feet from any planned development or construction activities. 
(d)  Upon completion of the tree survey it shall be submitted to the city administrator as a component of the tree preservation plan.

Sec. 99-24. - Tree removal chart. 
    The tree removal chart shall show the protected trees identified in the tree survey, which the applicant intends to remove as follows: 
(a)  Tree removal. 
(1)  Tree removal without mitigation. The tree removal chart shall identify significant, heritage or flood plain trees to be removed without mitigation (removal percentage without mitigation cannot 60 percent for significant trees, 40 percent for heritage trees, or 20 percent for flood plain trees). 
(2)  Tree removal with mitigation. If the percentage of protected trees to be removed, exceeds the percentages authorized under this chapter for removal without mitigation, the tree removal chart shall identify significant, heritage or flood plain trees to be removed with mitigation. The applicant shall also be required to follow the mitigation process set out in this chapter (entitled "protected tree mitigation plan"). 
(3)  For legacy trees identified for removal, procedures for legacy trees in this chapter shall be followed prior to any removal. 
( Ord. No. 2017-020, § 1(Exh. A), 5-9-17 ) 
Sec. 99-25. - Tree survey and tree removal chart expiration. 
(a)  Tree survey. A tree survey must be conducted within the 24 months of the tree removal permit application. If no tree survey exists that was conducted within 24 months immediately prior to submission of a tree removal permit application, a new tree survey must be made. 
(b)  Tree removal chart. 
(1)  No protected trees removed. A tree removal chart that is approved, but under which no protected tree has been removed shall remain in effect as long as the tree removal permit application remains effective, and shall expire with an expired tree removal permit. 
(2)  Once any protected tree is removed from a site pursuant to a tree removal chart, said chart shall remain a permanent record of the city regarding the site and shall set out a permanent baseline for removal percentages of unmitigated trees. Any subsequent application for a tree removal permit within 24 months prior to the tree survey, which seeks removal of protected trees without mitigation shall be considered on the percentage of protected trees shown as removed, and not mitigated, on the first tree removal chart. 
Example: An applicant submits a plat application for a subdivision plat on a site with ten significant large species trees with a total DBH of 100 inches. The applicant must preserve 40 percent) of significant trees DBH, and may remove 60 percent of significant large species trees dbh. the tree removal chart shows the removal of 30 DBH or 30 percent of the significant large species trees on the site. In such instance, the applicant for a building permit on the same site would be entitled to remove up to an additional 30 DBH [30 percent plus 30 percent already removed equals 60 percent trees DBH to be removed] without initiating a new tree survey; provided a tree removal chart showing the additional 30 DBH is filed with the building permit application. 
( Ord. No. 2017-020, § 1(Exh. A), 5-9-17 ) 
Sec. 99-26. - Protected tree mitigation plan. 
    Significant, heritage or flood plain trees may be removed in excess of the minimum preservation requirement contained in this chapter provided the excess removal is mitigated in accordance with this chapter. If mitigation is required to compensate for removing trees in excess of the number of diameter inches allowed to be removed within the surveyed area to be calculated for tree preservation under the minimum preservation requirements, the mitigation may be achieved in one of the ways, or combination, that follow: 
(a)  Establishment and maintenance of new trees on site: The adverse effects of the removal of significant, heritage and flood plain trees may be mitigated by the planting of new trees on-site pursuant to the requirements set out below: 
(1)  Replacement tree plan. A replacement tree plan shall be submitted to the city administrator, which includes: 
a.  The location, including identity of the lot or lots the replacement trees are to be placed upon, number and species of the replacement trees; and 
b.  The approximate date for replacement tree planting, which must fall within the seasons approved by the city arborist for replacement tree planting. Planting must occur within two years of issuance of the tree removal permit unless otherwise specified on the tree removal permit. 
(2)  Payment of replacement tree review fee shall be made as provided in the fee schedule. 
(3)  Mitigation ratios: Significant tree ratio must be at least 1:1 and heritage tree ratio must be at least 3:1. In calculating mitigation ratios the trunk diameter of the significant or heritage tree to be mitigated is measured by the DBH method and the replacement tree trunk diameter is measured six inches above ground. 
(4)  Restrictions: 
a.  No more than 25 percent of the replacement trees may be of the same species for the purposes of mitigation; and 
b.  Replacement trees must have a trunk of at least two inches in diameter. 
(5)  Inspection: 
a.  Upon completion of the planting of the replacement trees the applicant shall so inform the city arborist who will inspect the site to verify that the replacement trees were planted in accordance with the approved replacement tree plan. 
b.  Before the end of the second year after the date of the inspection referenced in the sub-section immediately above, the city arborist shall re-inspect the site. 
c.  Any replacement tree found dead at such re-inspection shall be required to be replaced by the then property owner who shall also be required to pay a re-inspection fee, in accordance with the fee schedule. Unless otherwise approved by the arborist, the tree replacing the dead tree shall be of the same species, with a trunk of the same diameter as the tree, which died. After the tree replacing the dead tree has been planted the property owner shall so inform the city administrator who in turn shall cause for a new inspection to verify that the planting of the tree was accomplished in accordance with the requirements of this sub-section. 
(6)  Certificate of occupancy. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any structure located on a lot on which a replacement tree is designated to be placed until the replacement tree has been planted. 
(7)  Fiscal responsibility. Development in the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be required to post fiscal security in the form or a performance bond, letter of credit or cash, in an amount equal to the amount required to mitigate the removal of protected trees by payment to the mitigation fund. Should performance of the planting of the replacement trees not occur within the time period specified in the tree removal permit, the city shall draw on the fiscal security to have the trees planted as shown on the tree replacement plan, or, in the event that the city is prohibited from entering such private property, the city shall cause the Replacement Trees to be planted on public property. 
(b)  Credit for preserving existing trees. 
(1)  Trees of a species listed as a protected tree, but which do not meet the minimum dbh to qualify as a protected tree, and which have a DBH of three or more inches (large species) or two or more inches (small species) may be credited toward the mitigation of protected trees an applicant seeks to remove. 
(2)  The amount of mitigation credit for the preservation of existing trees cannot exceed 50 percent of the DBH removal to be mitigated. 
(3)  Existing trees proposed for mitigation credit shall be identified on the replacement tree plan. 
(4)  The critical root area of existing trees proposed for mitigation credit shall be protected in the same manner as a protected tree. 
(5)  The city arborist shall review of any existing trees proposed for mitigation credit and shall approve mitigation credits, up to 50 percent of the required mitigation provided the existing tree appears healthy without disease and not in decline. 
(c)  Payment to the tree mitigation fund. In lieu of meeting the minimum preservation standards, a payment to the tree mitigation fund may be made as provided in the fee schedule. 
( Ord. No. 2017-020, § 1(Exh. A), 5-9-17 ) 
Sec. 99-27. - Tree removal permit issuance. 
(a)  Upon the city administrator's approval of the protected tree removal permit application, and the accompanying protected tree preservation plan, and if applicable, the protected tree mitigation plan the city administrator shall cause the issuance of a protected tree removal permit.

Sec. 100-54. - Lots. 
(a)  Minimum lot size. All lots in a subdivision within the corporate limits of the city shall meet the minimum dimensions and minimum lot area requirements of the zoning ordinance for the zoning district applicable to the land being subdivided or the requirements of the planned unit development plan which is approved under article IV of this chapter. All lots in a subdivision outside the corporate limits of the city, but within the limits of its extraterritorial jurisdiction, shall have a minimum area of 12,000 square feet and a minimum street frontage of 80 feet, except that single family residential lots fronting on the closed end of a cul-de-sac may have a minimum street frontage of 30 feet, and except that lesser requirements may be approved in a planned unit development under article IV of this chapter. 
(b)  Building setback lines. For a subdivision within the corporate limits of the city, building setback lines from the property lines shall meet the minimum requirements of the zoning ordinance for the zoning district applicable to the land being subdivided, or, if applicable, the requirements of an approved planned unit development plan. For a subdivision outside the corporate limits of the city but within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, building setback lines shall meet the minimum requirements which would be applicable in the least intensive zoning district which would permit the proposed land use if the subdivision were located inside the city's corporate limits, or the building setback lines shall meet the requirements of an approved planned unit development plan. 
(c)  Lot frontage requirements. Except when approved as part of a planned unit development, each lot shall be provided with adequate access to an existing or proposed public street by frontage on such street. Double front lots are prohibited except when a lot backs on an arterial, collector street, or a limited access street. Whenever feasible, each lot should face the front of a similar lot across the street. Rear and side driveway access to arterial, collector streets, or proposed limited access streets is prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. III, § 4, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-55. - Blocks. 
(a)  Block length. Blocks along minor streets may not be longer than 1,200 feet. Blocks along minor streets may not be shorter than 600 feet except for interior minor streets in a planned unit development.

(b)  Block width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of at least minimum depth, except when prevented by the size of the property or the need to back up to a limited access street and except when an alternative design is approved as part of a planned unit development. 
(c)  Block numbering. Blocks shall be numbered consecutively within the subdivision and/or sections of an overall plat as recorded. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. III, § 5, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-56. - Easements. 
(a)  Dedication required. Where necessary to adequately serve a subdivision with public utilities, the subdivider shall dedicate or grant easements for poles, wires, conduits, drainage channels, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines, gas lines, and other utilities. These easements shall be at least 20 feet wide, except that where an easement contains multiple utilities and the city determines that a greater width is necessary, the commission may require a minimum width of up to 30 feet. 
(b)  Location of easements. The easements required under this Section shall be continuous for the entire length of the block. These easements shall parallel as closely as possible the street line frontage of the block.

Secs. 100-57-100-70. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 

Sec. 100-71. - Statement of purpose. 
    Planned unit developments are established for the following purposes: 
(1)  To provide flexibility in the planning and construction of development projects by allowing a combination of land uses to be developed as an integrated whole in accordance with an approved plan that protects adjacent properties. 
(2)  To provide an environment within the layout of a site that contributes to a sense of community and a coherent living style. 
(3)  To encourage the preservation and enhancement of natural amenities and cultural resources; to protect the natural features of a site that relate to its topography, shape and size; and to provide for a greater amount of useable open space. 
(4)  To provide for a more efficient arrangement of land uses, buildings, circulation systems and infrastructure. 
(5)  To encourage in-fill development projects and the development of sites which are difficult to develop under conventional designs because of their shape, size, abutting development, poor accessibility, unique topography or other factors. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 1, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-72. - Evaluation criteria. 
    In order to foster the attractiveness of a planned unit development and its surrounding neighborhoods and thereby enhance property values in the community, and in order to maximize the efficiency of the street and utility systems, increase the affordability of new housing, improve the safety and separation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and increase the amount of open space which is useable by the public, the planning and zoning commission shall use the following criteria in reviewing and evaluating PUD plans. These criteria are not to be regarded as inflexible requirements, nor are they intended to discourage creativity and innovation. 
(1)  Insofar as practicable, the landscape shall be preserved in its natural state by minimizing tree and soil removal. The natural features of the landscape shall be integrated into the subdivision design as amenities enhancing the developed environment. 
(2)  Proposed buildings shall be sited in harmony with the terrain and with other buildings in the vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed development. 
(3)  Open spaces shall link residential areas with each other and with related nonresidential destinations and provide amenities which enhance the residential environment. Where possible, these open spaces shall link directly to parks, other open spaces, schools and other community institutions adjacent to the subdivision. 
(4)  Pedestrian paths, bicycle paths, driveways, parking areas and interior streets in the subdivision shall be located and designed to take best advantage of the topography and natural features of the landscape, to separate vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic as much as practical, and to contribute to rather than detract from the design of proposed land uses and neighboring properties. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 2, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-73. - Minimum residential lot size. 
    There is no minimum lot size for a residential lot in a planned unit development, provided that for each square foot by which the area of any residential lot is less than 4,000 square feet, the minimum open space requirement established by section 100-76 is increased by an equivalent square foot of community open space. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 3, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-74. - Minimum residential lot width and street frontage. 
    There is no minimum width and no minimum street frontage for a residential lot in a planned unit development. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 4, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-75. - Building setback lines. 
    There are no minimum front, side or rear yard setback requirements in a planned unit development, except as follows. 
(1)  Along the perimeter of a planned unit development, all lots must meet the same minimum setback requirements as would be required in a subdivision which is not a PUD, unless the planning and zoning commission and the city council approves a lesser setback in the PUD plan. 
(2)  On any lot which has driveway access to a street, all buildings and other structures must be set back at least ten feet from the lot line adjacent to the street. 
(3)  On any corner lot, no wall, fence or other structure may be erected above a height of three feet, and no hedge, shrub, tree or other vegetation may be maintained above a height of three feet, within the triangular area formed by the intersecting street lines and a straight line connecting such street lines at points 25 feet from the point of intersection measured along such street line. 
(4)  A minimum of ten feet of open space must be provided on all sides of every building, except that residential dwelling units may be built with one side wall located on a lot line when a minimum ten-foot side yard setback is provided on the adjacent lot and such side yard setback on the adjacent lot is noted on the final plat. 
(5)  Drainage easements and utility easements shall be provided as required by other provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 5, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-76. - Minimum open space requirements. 
(a)  Minimum requirements. Each planned unit development shall provide for a minimum amount of community open space as follows. For a residential PUD, the minimum requirement is 20 percent of the gross site area of the subdivision. For a non-residential PUD, the minimum requirement is ten percent of the gross site area of the subdivision. For a PUD which includes both residential and non-residential development, the total requirement is calculated according to the relative proportions of the gross site area of the subdivision which are proposed to be developed in residential and non-residential uses. 
(b)  Reductions in minimum requirement. Up to 25 percent of the minimum community open space requirement may be met by including one-half of the area of any public park, unimproved floodplain, cemetery or other beneficial open space area which is contiguous and accessible to the subdivision and which, in the judgment of the planning and zoning commission and the city council, has a reasonable expectation of perpetuity. In their discretion, the planning and zoning commission and the city council may also approve a decrease of up to 25 percent of the minimum community open space requirement when the PUD plan includes unique design features or amenities which achieve an especially attractive and desirable development, including, but not limited to, terraces, sculpture, water features, preservation and enhancement of unusual natural features or cultural resources, or other unusual amenities which the commission and council finds will benefit the community as a whole in addition to the occupants of the subdivision. However, in no case may the total reduction in the minimum community open space requirement exceed 40 percent. 
(c)  Forms of dedication. The community open space required by this section may either be dedicated to the city as public park land or be dedicated as common area for use by the residents/occupants of the PUD, to be owned and managed by a community association which is directly responsible to and controlled by the property owners in the subdivision. In the case of community open space which is proposed to be dedicated as parkland, the city shall inspect the area in the field and make a recommendation to the planning and zoning commission at the time the commission considers the PUD plan as to the desirability of accepting the proposed dedication and the city's likely ability to fund the future operation and maintenance of the proposed facilities. In the case of proposed dedication as common area, the community association must meet the requirements of section 100-77 below. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 7, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-77. - Common areas and community association. 
(a)  Dedication of common areas and facilities. All common areas and facilities which are to be dedicated for collective use or maintained and operated for common benefit by the residents/occupants of a planned unit development, including the community open space required by this ordinance and any fences, walls, parking areas or other facilities which are to be maintained for the common benefit of the property owners, shall be owned and managed by a community association which is directly responsible to and controlled by the property owners in the subdivision. The community association shall be established by a legal instrument constituting a plan for the operation, use, repair and permanent maintenance of the common areas and facilities through an association of the property owners which is self-perpetuating and adequately funded to accomplish its purposes through mandatory assessments against the individual property owners. The instrument establishing the association shall grant the city, other public agencies, political subdivisions and public utilities written permission for access to the common areas and facilities at any time and without liability when on official business, and permission to remove any obstructions if necessary to obtain timely and practical access, and to assess the cost of removal to the owner of the obstruction. If any part of the required community open space is to be dedicated as common area rather than as public park land, the instrument shall also covenant that the association will levy and enforce against the property owners sufficient assessments to satisfy a charge by the city for correcting deficiencies in the upkeep, maintenance and repair of the community open space under a maintenance agreement for these areas, in addition to any other association assessments for common purposes. The instrument must be approved by the city attorney prior to consideration by the planning and zoning commission of the final subdivision plat and it shall be recorded at the same time as the final plat. Any amendments to this instrument by the subdivider, prior to the time the subdivider relinquishes majority voting control of the association to the property owners, must also be approved by the city attorney before being recorded and going into effect. 
(b)  Funding of community association. Prior to approval of the instrument establishing a community association, the subdivider shall submit to the city administrator a multi-year budget for the association including a fund reserved for the repair and maintenance of the common areas and facilities. The budget shall be accompanied by justifications and calculations demonstrating that the projected property owner assessments will be sufficient to fully fund both the current operation and the continued future repair and maintenance of the common areas and facilities. Prior to approving the budget, the city administrator shall consult on the matter with a professional community association manager or association management specialist certified by the Community Associations Institute, or an equivalent expert in the management of community associations, who is independent of any contractual relationship with the subdivider. An estimate of the community association consultant's fee for review of the budget shall be included in the fee established by city council for review and processing of the PUD plan. At the same time as the instrument establishing the association is filed, the subdivider shall post a bond or other security, in a form acceptable to the city and payable to the association, guaranteeing that the reserve fund for repair and maintenance will be fully funded at the level projected in the budget at the time the subdivider relinquishes majority voting control of the association to the property owners. This bond or other security shall be held by the city for the benefit of the association, and it shall be released only upon the subdivider's submission to the city administrator of proof, in a form acceptable to the city, that the reserve fund has been funded at the level projected and that the subdivider has relinquished majority voting control of the association to the property owners. 
(c)  Maintenance of community open space. The legal instrument establishing the community association shall also be accompanied by a maintenance agreement between the city and the association for the upkeep, maintenance and repair of all the common areas and common area facilities which are to be dedicated as community open space. This agreement shall provide for periodic inspection of the facilities by the city and for a procedure by which the city may give formal notice to the association of any deficiencies which are found in the upkeep, maintenance and repair of the facilities. Following notice and a reasonable time for the association to correct any deficiencies, the agreement shall authorize the city to undertake any work which may be necessary in the judgment of the city to repair or maintain the facilities at an acceptable standard and to charge the cost to the association. The agreement shall bind the association to levy and enforce against the property owners such assessments as may be necessary to satisfy the charge, and to make prompt payment to the city. The agreement must be approved by the city attorney prior to the consideration by the planning and zoning commission of a final subdivision plat. The agreement shall be recorded at the same time as the final plat, and a note indicating that such an agreement has been entered into shall be entered on the final plat. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 7, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-78. - Transfer of open space dedicated as park land. 
    If any part of the community open space is to be dedicated as park land, the area to be so dedicated shall be indicated on the final subdivision plat as "Park Land Dedicated to the City of Castroville." The total acreage of the park shall be noted on the final plat, and the dedication of the park shall also be noted in the narrative portion of the final plat where the subdivider dedicates easements, rights-of-way and other improvements to the city. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 8, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-79. - Procedures for approval of PUD plan. 
(a)  Preliminary concept plan. Prior to submitting a PUD plan for approval, the subdivider must request a pre-application conference with the city administrator and designated city staff. At this conference the subdivider shall submit a preliminary concept plan for the planned unit development. The preliminary concept plan need not be engineered, but it must contain at least the following information in sufficient detail to permit understanding of the proposal. 
(1)  A map of the site, drawn to scale and showing north point, the boundaries of the proposed development, adjacent subdivisions, and the streets in the vicinity of the site. 
(2)  A map showing general topographic considerations affecting the site, floodplains and watercourses on the site and in the vicinity, and any other significant environmental features that may affect the site. 
(3)  The general layout proposed for the planned unit development, delineating the areas which are proposed for residential development, the forms and densities proposed in each such area, the areas proposed for non-residential development, and the general nature of the uses proposed in each such area, and the areas proposed as community open space, and the general character proposed for each such area. 
(4)  The total acreage of the site, the number of acres to be developed in each type of residential and non-residential development which is proposed, and the number of acres proposed to be dedicated as community open space. 
(5)  The total number of residential dwelling units of each type proposed, and the approximate gross square footage of each type of non-residential development proposed. 
At the pre-application conference, the city administrator and staff will offer initial comments on the merits of the proposal, suggestions for refinement, and other information and advice to aid the subdivider in the preparation of a formal PUD plan. 
(b)  Coordination with zoning ordinance. If any part of the proposed PUD subdivision is located inside the city limits, the subdivider must submit to the city administrator an application for a change of zoning to establish a PUD overlay zoning district and the appropriate underlying zoning use districts on the subdivision site or portion of the subdivision site inside the city limits before or at the same time the subdivider submits the PUD plan for approval. The PUD plan for a subdivision which is wholly or partly inside the city limits may not be considered by the planning and zoning commission or city council until the commission or council has acted on the required zoning change on the subdivision site or portion of the subdivision site inside the city limits. If any part of the proposed PUD subdivision is located outside the city limits at the time council approves the PUD plan and that area is subsequently annexed by the city, the portion of the PUD subdivision which is annexed shall automatically be placed in a PUD overlay zoning district and in the underlying zoning use districts appropriate to the land uses indicated by the approved PUD plan. 
(c)  Form and content of pud plan. The PUD plan for a proposed planned unit development subdivision must be drawn on reproducible mylar by a registered architect or registered engineer and must include the following: 
(1)  Date, scale, north point (with north to the top if possible), name of subdivider, and name of the person preparing the PUD plan. 
(2)  The location of the city limit lines and the outer border of the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction if either traverses the subdivision or is contiguous to a subdivision boundary. 
(3)  The location, right-of-way width, name and description of all existing or recorded streets and alleys within or adjacent to the subdivision, as determined from existing records, and the location of all intersections adjacent to the subdivision. 
(4)  The right-of-way and description of all proposed streets and alleys within the subdivision. 
(5)  The location, right-of-way, and type or purpose of all existing easements within and adjacent to the subdivision. 
(6)  The centerline of existing watercourses, creeks and drainage structures within and adjacent to the subdivision, and the limits of the 100-year flood plains if applicable. 
(7)  The centerline of proposed watercourses, creeks and drainage structures, and the general nature and extent of any other water features that are proposed to be developed. 
(8)  The area and acreage in each distinct type of proposed land use. 
(9)  The areas and acreages which are to be dedicated as community open space, including an indication whether the dedication is to be as a public park or as common area owned and managed by a community association. 
(10)  The location, type and height of the fences, walls or other screening devices which are proposed to buffer the PUD from adjacent developments and, within the PUD, to buffer one land use from another. 
The information which is presented graphically in the PUD plan must be accompanied by the following information in narrative or tabular form: 
(1)  The total number of dwelling units in each distinct type proposed, the total acreage in each distinct type of residential development, and the resulting densities in dwelling units per acre. 
(2)  The total acreage and gross square feet proposed in each distinct type of non-residential development. 
(3)  Descriptions of the number, size and character of any active recreational facilities and community meeting spaces which are to be included in the community open space. 
(4)  Calculations showing the minimum total area of community open space which is required by this ordinance, and the actual areas which are proposed to be dedicated as community open space. A narrative justification must accompany any request for a reduction in the community open space requirement. 
(d)  Processing of PUD plan. The PUD plan must be submitted to the city administrator, accompanied by the appropriate fee established by city council. No later than 21 calendar days of the submission, the city administrator shall review the PUD plan for completeness and compliance with all of the requirements of this chapter, and notify the subdivider in writing of any deficiencies in the plan as initially submitted. When the PUD plan is accepted as complete by the city, the planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing and shall act on the PUD plan at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the commission which allows sufficient time for public notice and hearing. Notice of the public hearing must be given to all property owners within 200 feet of the boundaries of the proposed PUD subdivision in the same manner as notice for a public hearing on a change of zoning. 
(e)  Planning and zoning commission action. Following the public hearing on the PUD plan, the planning and zoning commission shall recommend to city council that council either approve the plan as submitted, approve the plan with amendments or conditions, or disapprove the plan. In recommending amendments or conditions, the commission shall be limited to recommending such amendments as are necessary in the commission's judgment to protect the public health, safety, morals and general welfare or conditions related to the acceptance of the proposed dedication of community open space as parkland. The commission shall file its report on the matter with city council as soon as practicable after adopting its recommendation to council. 
(f)  Application for action by city council. Following the action by the planning and zoning commission, the subdivider may then file an application with the city administrator for action by city council. Such application shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee established by city council. If the planning and zoning commission has recommended amendments or conditions for approval of the PUD plan, the subdivider may incorporate these amendments or conditions in a revised plan to be presented to council without further action by the commission. 
(g)  Hearing and action by city council. Following the receipt by city council of the report of the planning and zoning commission and of the subdivider's application to proceed, city council shall hold a public hearing and take final action on the pud plan at the next regularly scheduled council meeting which allows sufficient time for public notice of the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be published in the same manner as notice of a hearing before city council on a proposed change of zoning. 
(h)  Joint hearings before commission and council. In filing an initial application for consideration of the PUD plan by the planning and zoning commission, the subdivider may request expedited action by filing an application to proceed before city council at the same time. Such request shall be accompanied by the appropriate filing fees for both actions. The commission and the council may then hold their public hearings on the matter jointly, provided that both the published notice of the hearings and the notice to the property owners within 200 feet of the subject property indicate that the hearings will be conducted by both the commission and the council. Following the conclusion of this joint public hearing, the city council may act on the matter without the necessity of a written report from the planning and zoning commission. 
(i)  Approval when protested. If the planning and zoning commission recommends disapproval of the PUD plan, or if the PUD plan is protested in writing by the owners of 20 percent or more either of the number of lots or of the area of land immediately adjoining the proposed PUD subdivision and within 200 feet from the proposed subdivision boundary, then the PUD plan may not be approved except by a vote of at least three-fourths of all members of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 9, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-80. - Staging of development plan. 
    A PUD plan may be divided into stages for sequential development over time. In such a case, the initial PUD plan shall include the entire area of the tract which is to be developed as a planned unit development, and it shall indicate the sequence and approximate schedule for development of all the various subareas within the tract. If the PUD subdivision is located wholly or partly within the city limits, approval of the initial PUD plan must be preceded or accompanied by approval of PUD overlay zoning for the entire area of the subdivision inside the city limits, as provided by the zoning ordinance. Preliminary and final subdivision plats which conform to the initial overall PUD plan may then be submitted for approval as individual subareas within the overall PUD are readied for development. Any variation in land uses from those approved in the initial PUD plan shall require approval of an amended overall PUD plan, under the same procedures as required for an initial PUD plan. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 10, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-81. - Timing of open space improvements. 
    All improvements to the required community open space which are shown in the PUD plan must be constructed by the subdivider at the same time as the subdivider constructs the streets, drainage system and other components of the subdivision infrastructure. Improvements to the community open space which is internal to or otherwise distinctly associated with an individual subarea of a PUD which is to be developed in stages must be constructed at the same time as the other components of subdivision infrastructure shown on the final plat for that stage of the subdivision development. No building permits shall be issued and no utility connections shall be made for any building or structure on any lot outside the community open space until these improvements have been inspected and approved by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 11, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-82. - Plan changes. 
    Following approval of a PUD plan by city council, alterations to the plan are classified as either substantial or nonsubstantial amendments. Nonsubstantial amendments must be approved by the city. Substantial amendments must be considered by the planning and zoning commission and approved by city council following the same procedures as required for approval of an initial PUD plan, including payment of the appropriate fee. A substantial amendment is any of the following. 
(1)  A change which would add a land use not previously approved as part of the PUD plan. 
(2)  A change which would alter the land use in an area within 200 feet of a boundary of the PUD subdivision. 
(3)  A change which would increase the overall density of the PUD by ten percent or more. However, in no case may the overall density of a PUD located inside the city limits exceed that permitted by the PUD zoning district. 
(4)  A change which would reduce the total area to be dedicated as community open space, or which would alter the location of that area by ten percent or more. 
(5)  Any other change which in the judgment of the city would significantly alter the general character or overall design of the subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 12, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-83. - Expiration of PUD plan. 
    An approved PUD plan shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if a final subdivision plat is not submitted for approval by the planning and zoning commission within three years of the date of approval of the PUD plan by city council. Upon application by the subdivider, the planning and zoning commission may grant one extension of this time limit of up to two years if the commission finds that the additional time is warranted. A subdivider's failure to initiate development by filing a final subdivision plat within the approved time period shall void the PUD plan, and no building permits shall be issued and no utility connections shall be made until a new or revised PUD plan has been resubmitted and approved. In the case of a PUD subdivision which is divided into stages, each stage following the first stage to be developed must be initiated by the submission to the city administrator of a final subdivision plat for that stage, for approval by the planning and zoning commission and the city council, within 3 years of the date of approval by the city council of the final subdivision plat for the previous stage. Failure to initiate development of a second or later stage within this time period shall void the PUD plan with respect to the undeveloped stages, but development may continue in previously initiated stages. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. IV, § 13, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-84. - Additional requirements for preliminary subdivision plat. 
    In addition to the requirements for a preliminary subdivision plat which apply to a conventional subdivision, the preliminary plat of a planned unit development subdivision must contain or be accompanied by the following. 
(1)  Clear delineation of the areas which are to be reserved for off-street parking and loading, and the ratios of parking spaces to square feet of floor area for each lot to be developed in a non-residential use, and a clear delineation of the areas which are to be reserved for residential off-street parking and the number of parking spaces to be provided for each dwelling unit. 
(2)  The location, type and height of all proposed fences, screening walls, and other screening devices intended to buffer one land use from another or to buffer the PUD subdivision from adjacent properties. 
(3)  The location and character of all improvements to be made in community open space areas, including a general landscape plan for each area.

ARTICLE V. - STREETS 

Sec. 100-111. - General layout and alignment of streets. 
(a)  General requirements. Adequate streets shall be provided by the subdivider, and the arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of each shall conform to the comprehensive plan of the city and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public safety and convenience, and in their appropriate relationship to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. The street layout shall be devised for the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood. 
(b)  Continuation of existing streets. Where necessary to the neighborhood, existing streets in adjoining areas shall be continued, and the new streets shall be at least as wide as the existing streets and in alignment therewith. Arterial, and collector streets shall be extended through any new subdivision along the general route indicated in the city's comprehensive plan, with due regard to the specific terrain and topography of the subdivision site. Off-center street intersections with streets in adjacent subdivisions shall be avoided. 
(c)  Interior circulation streets. Adequate collector streets shall be provided for the circulation of traffic through the subdivision, and adequate minor streets shall be provided to accommodate the subdivision. 
(d)  Projection into unsubdivided areas. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into such unsubdivided areas. 
(e)  Street jogs. Whenever possible, street jogs with center line offsets of less than 150 feet shall be avoided. 
(f)  Half streets. In the case of collector, minor, and marginal access streets, no new half-streets shall be platted. 
(g)  Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited except as short stubs to permit future expansion. The length of such a stub shall not exceed the frontage of the corner lot which has the greater frontage on either side of the dead-end street. 
(h)  Private streets. Private streets are prohibited. 
(i)  Ingress and egress. 
(1)  Road network. New subdivisions shall be supported by a road network having adequate capacity, ingress/egress, and safe and efficient traffic circulation. The adequacy of the road network for developments of 200 or more dwelling units, or for developments generating 2,000 or more "one-way" trips per day, or for developments involving collector or arterial streets not appearing on the city's adopted comprehensive plan, shall be demonstrated by preparation and submission, prior to or along with the preliminary plat application, of a traffic impact analysis prepared, which takes into consideration the need to accommodate traffic generated by the development, land to be developed in common ownership and other developed property. In the event that the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a larger development project, or constitutes a portion of the land to be ultimately developed, the city council may require a demonstration of adequacy pursuant to this section for additional phases or portions of the property as a condition of approval for the proposed preliminary plat. In the event that the applicant submits a traffic impact analysis for an entire phased development project, the city may require an update of the study for each subsequent phase of the development which reflects any applicable changed conditions. If the preliminary plat is in conformance with the comprehensive plan and if the preliminary plat is for a development of less than 200 dwelling units or for a development generating less than 2,000 "one-way" trips per day, then a traffic impact analysis is not required. 
(2)  Approach roads and access. All subdivisions with 50 or more lots must have at least two points of vehicular access (primarily for emergency vehicles), and must be connected via improved roadways to the improved thoroughfare and street system (city, county and state, as may be applicable) by one or more approach roads of such dimensions and improved to such standards as are hereinafter set forth. Requirements for dedication of right-of-way and improvement of approach roads may be increased depending upon the size or density of the proposed development, or if such need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis. This requirement shall be waived by the City upon demonstration by the applicant that the required access points are prohibited by TxDOT. 
a.  "Two points of vehicular access" shall be construed to mean that the subdivision has at least two improved roads accessing the subdivision from the improved thoroughfare system, and the subdivision has at least two road entrances.

Sec. 100-115. - Standards for alternate pavement designs. 
    The city may approve alternative pavement designs provided such alternative is so designed, in the judgment of the city, as to assure reasonable durability and economy of maintenance and provided the alternative is in accordance with Tables A and B and the following provisions of this section. 
(a)  Soils investigation. The subdivider shall, at his/her own expense, cause to be made a soils investigation by a qualified and independent geotechnical engineer licensed to practice in the State of Texas. The field investigation shall include test borings within the rights-of-way of all proposed streets. The number and locations of such borings shall be subject to the approval of the city. Atterberg limits and moisture contents shall be determined for all significant boring samples. The method used for these determinations shall be the same as that used by the Texas Department of Transportation using their latest Manual of Testing Procedures, 100-E Series test methods. The results of the soils investigation shall be presented to the subdivider and to the city administrator in written report form. Included as a part of the report shall be a graphical or tabular presentation of the boring data giving Atterberg limits and moisture contents, a soil description of the layers of different soils encountered in the profile of the hole, their limits in relation to a fixed surface datum, and such other information as needed to complete the soils investigation for pavement design purposes. Minimum depth of soil profile boring holes shall be 10 feet unless solid rock formations are encountered sooner. 
(b)  Pavement design loads. Pavement design shall be based on the Texas Department of Transportation tri-axial design standards in the following table.

A written report containing pavement design data and recommendations based on the soils investigation shall be prepared at the subdivider's expense by a qualified geotechnical engineer licensed to practice in the State of Texas, and shall be presented to the subdivider and to the city administrator. The report shall state the load criteria and the soil classifications used. When approved by the city, the geotechnical engineer preparing the report may use the tri-axial classification soils data given in Texas Department of Transportation report number 3-05-71-035, entitled "Tri-axial Classification of the Surface Soils of Texas, as Grouped by Soil Conservation Service Series." 
When using the tri-axial data, the report shall so state. The pavement design shall be subject to the approval of the city and shall be shown on the street construction plans as approved. Where the plasticity index of the subgrade soil on which the street is to be built is in excess of 20, the pavement design shall include subgrade stabilization unless approved otherwise by the city. 
When subgrade soils are stabilized the minimum depth of stabilization shall be six inches unless otherwise approved by the city. In the stabilization of swelling clay soils, the stabilizer used shall be hydrated lime. The lime shall be applied to the subgrade soil in slurry form unless otherwise approved by the city. For alternate pavement designs within the city limits, the flexible base material and the stabilized layer, if used, shall extend at least 18 inches behind the back of the curb. The paving requirements shall be minimum thicknesses of hot-mix, hot-lay asphaltic concrete of 1&half inches for minor streets and marginal access streets, and two inches for arterial and collector streets. Street and alley pavements in commercial and industrial areas shall utilize the design standards set forth herein for collector streets. Alley pavements in residential areas shall utilize the design standards set forth herein for minor streets. 
For alternate pavement designs outside the city limits, the flexible base material and the stabilized layer, if used, shall extend at least 24 inches beyond the pavement edge, and a tack coat shall be applied for the full width. The paving requirement shall be a double asphalt surface treatment. The rate of application for MC-A, HVRS, CRS2 or HFRS2 emulsion for two coats shall be a minimum of 0.60 gallons per square yard. The first course shall be uncoated crushed rock applied at the rate of one cubic yard per 90 square yards. The second course shall be coated crushed rock applied at the rate of one cubic yard per 100 square yards.

(a)  Permanent. In the interior of a subdivision, minor streets ending in cul-de-sacs may be platted where the planning and zoning commission deems it advisable. Where the land being subdivided adjoins property not being subdivided, minor streets ending in cul-de-sacs may be platted provided the streets are carried to the boundaries of the subdivision. Single-family residential area streets permanently ending in cul-de-sacs may not be longer than 600 feet, and shall be provided at the closed end with a paved turnaround at least 80 feet in diameter on a street right-of-way of at least 100 feet in diameter. Multi-family, commercial and industrial area streets permanently ending in cul-de-sacs may not be longer than 600 feet, and shall be provided at the closed end with a paved turnaround at least 100 feet in diameter on a street right-of-way of at least 120 feet in diameter. 
(b)  Temporary. A temporary turn-around must be built at the end of a street more than 600 feet long that will be extended in the future. The following note shall be placed on the plat: "Cross-hatched area is a temporary easement for turn-around purposes until the street is extended to the (direction) on a recorded plat." 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. V, § 7, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-118. - Alleys. 
    Alleys are optional in all subdivisions, provided that they conform to the standards and requirements of this ordinance. All alleys must intersect streets at a 90-degree angle, or as close to a 90-degree angle as practicable in the judgment of the city administrator, and they must be approximately parallel to the streets on both sides. Where two alleys or utility easements intersect or turn at a right angle, a cutoff of not less than ten feet from the normal intersection of the property or easement line shall be provided along each property or easement line. Dead-end alleys are prohibited.

(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. V, § 10, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-120. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  General requirements. Concrete sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of all streets in a subdivision within the city limits, unless either (a) the subdivider does not control one side of the street or (b) the street is a marginal access street parallel to an arterial or collector street. Concrete sidewalks are optional outside the city limits. Arterial shall have minimum six-foot wide sidewalks, collector and minor shall have minimum five-foot wide sidewalks, and marginal access four-foot wide sidewalks with a handicap passing area measuring 60" × 60" every 200 lineal feet. The walking surface of sidewalks on all class of streets shall have a maximum running slope of 1:20 (5%), and a maximum cross slope of 1:48 (2%). Pedestrian ramps meeting the requirements of the American with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines shall be required where all sidewalks meet curbs. 
(b)  Location of sidewalks. Required sidewalks along arterial and collector streets shall be located in the street right-of-way, adjacent to and parallel to either the property line or the curb, as determined by the planning and zoning commission to be most advantageous in connecting to adjacent developments. Required sidewalks along other streets may be located either in the street right-of-way or in a five-foot wide sidewalk easement. Along minor streets, the required sidewalks shall be adjacent to and abutting the property line, unless the commission approves an alternate location adjacent to the curb, in which case the minimum width shall be increased to five-feet. Required sidewalks shall extend along all street frontage including the side of corner lots and block ends; provided, however, that where it is impractical for the subdivider to provide such sidewalks on the side lot lines abutting arterials or drainage ditches, the planning and zoning commission may waive this requirement at preliminary plat approval. If physical circumstances prevent locating the sidewalks as provided by this section, then the exact location shall be at the discretion of the city. 
(c)  Exceptions in planned unit developments. The planning and zoning commission may waive the requirement for sidewalks along one or both sides of an interior single family residential street in a planned unit development. The commission may also waive the requirement that sidewalks be located in the street right-of-way of other minor streets in a planned unit development, where the commission determines that an alternate location is more desirable in the public interest. Such waivers, if granted, shall be at preliminary plat approval. 
(d)  Sidewalk obstructions. Mailbox clusters, kiosks of any character, and other similar sidewalk obstructions shall be located only in an extension of the sidewalk behind the minimum required sidewalk width. 
(e)  Timing of sidewalk construction. Construction of the sidewalks on each street is not necessary until construction begins on the first building on that street. However, to avoid undue costs and damage to sidewalks, the subdivider, developer or builder may construct the sidewalk on each lot as it is developed. In no case will a certificate of occupancy be issued for a building until the required sidewalks have been constructed.

(d)  Use of streets and alleys as drainage facilities. Alleys shall be designed to carry storm water on at least a five-year frequency. Streets may be used for storm water drainage only if the calculated storm water flow does not exceed the height of the curb and the velocity does not exceed ten feet per second. Minor streets shall be designed on a basis of at least a five-year storm frequency and all other streets on at least a ten-year frequency. Where streets are not capable of carrying storm waters as required above, drainage channels or storm sewers shall be provided. Street width shall not be increased beyond the width determined by the street classification solely to accommodate drainage. 
(e)  Storm sewers. Where storm sewers are provided or required, their design shall be based on a 25-year storm frequency and the design must be approved by the city. For all ordinary conditions, storm sewers shall be designed on the assumption that they will flow full under the design discharge; however, whenever the system is placed under a pressure head or there are construction, turns, submerged or inadequate outfalls, or other obstacles, the hydraulic grade line shall be computed and plotted in profile. In all cases adequate outlets shall be provided, and no storm sewers shall be less than 18 inches in diameter. 
(f)  Street inlets to storm sewers. The entire 25-year discharge shall be picked up at the point where the street can no longer handle the runoff flowing curb full. No allowance shall be made for overruns or partial street flows combined with storm sewer flows at initial pickup points. Street discharges, after initial pickup, may be based upon the street classification for frequency required. 
(g)  Capacity of open drainage channels. The design of all open drainage channels shall be based on a 25-year storm frequency and must be approved by the city. All open drainage channels shall be designed with at least the minimum freeboard specified in the following table. 
Table K. Minimum Drainage Channel Freeboard Design Depth of Flow Required Freeboard Less than 5 feet 0.5 feet 5 to 10 feet 10% of design depth of flow Greater than 10 feet 1.0 foot  
  
Allowance for extra freeboard shall be made wherever design conditions such as channel bends or turns require it. 
(h)  Lining of open drainage channels. The following table shall be used to determine the type of channel lining which shall be used for scour protection. Velocities are limited flows produced by a storm event no greater than a ten-year event. 
Table L. Velocity Control Requirements Velocity Type of Channel 
Lining Required Less than 3 feet per second Earth or sod lined 3 to 5 feet per second Sod lined Greater than 5 feet per second Concrete lined  
  
Concrete lined channels may also be used at velocities of 5 feet per second or less if so desired by the subdivider. Where velocities are in the super critical range, allowance shall be made in the design for the proper handling of the water. 
(i)  Design of concrete lined channels. All concrete lined channels shall be designed according to the following standards, and their design must be approved by the City. 
(1)  From the top of the concrete lining to the top of the ditch, the side slope shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one vertical, nor shall the slope be less than 12 horizontal to one vertical. 
(2)  For normal conditions, the concrete lining shall be a minimum of four inches thick and reinforced with No. 3 rebar placed not more than 18 inches on centers in both directions. Where the surface, the nature of the ground, height and steepness of slope, or other factors become critical, the concrete design shall be in accordance with the latest structural standards. All concrete lining shall develop a 28-day compressive strength of not less than 2,500 pounds per square inch. 
(3)  Maximum side slopes of concrete rip-rap shall be one to one, unless actual soils test data submitted by a soils engineer shows that a steeper special design is allowable. A minimum of 200 pounds per square foot surcharge shall be used. 
(4)  Vertical walls shall not exceed a depth of two feet unless the channel is properly fenced or enclosed. 
(5)  Easements or rights-of-way for concrete lined channels shall extend a minimum of five feet on both sides of the extreme limits of the channel. "Extreme limits" of the channel shall mean the side slope intercept with the natural ground or proposed finished ground elevation. 
(6)  The minimum N value of 0.015 shall be used for the roughness coefficient in Manning's formula for a wood float type surface finish. 
(7)  Where conditions warrant, the design of alternative composite sections is encouraged. 
(j)  Design of sod-lined and earth channels. All sod-lined and earth channels shall be designed according to the following standards, and their design shall be approved by the city. 
(1)  The side slope shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one vertical. 
(2)  Easements or rights-of-way for sod-lined and earth channels shall extend a minimum of two feet on one side and 15 feet for an access road on the opposite side of the extreme limits of the channels, when such channels do not parallel and adjoin a street or alley. When such channels parallel and adjoin a street or alley, the easement or right-of-way shall extend a minimum of two feet on both sides of the extreme limits of the channel. Where utilities are installed in the access road of the drainage right-of-way, said right-of-way shall extend two feet on one side and 17 feet on the opposite side of the design limits of the channel. These 17 feet are to provide an access way along the channel with a maximum cross slope of a 1/2 inch per foot toward the channel. 
(3)  The minimum N value of 0.035 shall be used for the roughness coefficient in Manning's formula for sod-lined and earth channels.

Federal flood plains are based on a 100-year frequency discharge, and apply only in those areas where official Federal Emergency Management Agency maps have been prepared, or where 100-year water and surface profile studies are available for the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted in an area having special flood hazards as established in Article 3, Section B, Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of the City of Castroville, Texas, [section 54-28 of this Code] unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not substantially increase the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood plain at any point within the city's subdivision jurisdiction. 
(c)  General requirements in flood plains. The minimum building slab elevation in the 100-year floodplain shall be one foot above the 100-year floodplain. The limits of the 100-year flood plain and the limits of the floodway shall be shown on the preliminary and final plats as applicable. No habitable structure shall be constructed within the limits of the 100-year floodplain. 
(d)  Flood hazards to water and wastewater systems. New or replacement water supply systems and/or wastewater systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(e)  Review of proposed subdivision flood hazards. Proposed subdivisions shall be reviewed to assure that: 
(1)  All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located, elevated, and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and 
(3)  Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(f)  Access to subdivisions. The planning and zoning commission shall not permit new "island" subdivisions, lots or streets that would be surrounded by the floodwaters of the 100-year flood plain, unless: 
(1)  The area is accessible to high ground by a street elevated above the 100-year flood level; or 
(2)  The evidence presented shows that the surface area and elevation of the "island" is sufficient to sustain the residents safely during a 100-year flood.

(1)  The ratio of the potential tax revenues and utility system revenues from property within the industrial park or commercial development to the costs to the city of extending water, gas and sewer mains and electric primary distribution lines to the proposed industrial park or commercial development. 
(2)  The availability of funds for the extension of such mains and distribution lines. 
(3)  The contribution, if any, by the subdivider for the extension of the mains and distribution lines. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. VIII, § 3, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-194. - Cost distribution for oversize facilities. 
    In the event that the planning and zoning commission deems it necessary and prudent to require lift stations, booster pumps, mains, equipment, streets and/or appurtenances which are larger or whose capacities are in excess of those which are usual, customary and necessary to meet the needs and requirements of a particular subdivision, then the commission may recommend to the city council and the council may determine that the city shall pay to the subdivider the difference in cost (including construction and installation) between those lift stations, booster pumps, mains, equipment, streets and/or appurtenances which the city requires the subdivider to install, and the cost of like equipment of the size and/or capacity which would have adequately met and served the needs of the subdivision. Providing that funds are available, the city may also participate in the extra cost of bridges and/or large drainage structures on arterial and collector streets. 
(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. VIII, § 4, 1-14-2002)

(Ord. No. 2002-003, art. VIII, § 5, 1-14-2002) 
Sec. 100-196. - Water and sewer main extension reimbursements. 
(a)  Eligibility for reimbursement. When a subdivider must extend water and/or sewer mains through previously unserviced and unsubdivided areas of a drainage basin, the city may reimburse the subdivider for that proportional cost of the extension by those subdividers who subdivide property between the original subdivider's subdivision and the point of connection to existing city utilities. 
(b)  Formula for reimbursement. The amount of the reimbursement under this section shall be calculated as follows. 
(1)  Determine the total area to be served by the water and sewer main extensions, including the original subdivision. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to provide the city with this information, to be substantiated by city staff. 
(2)  Determine the cost of extension of the trunk mains minus any oversizing costs contributed by the city. 
(3)  Determine the trunk main unit cost per acre by dividing the total adjusted cost, subsection (b)(2) by the total acreage, subsection (b)(1). 
(4)  The unit cost per acre shall be charged to each subsequent subdivider who may connect to the trunk main, and shall be paid to the subdivider who originally installed the trunk main, or the original subdivider's heirs or assigns. 
(5)  Force mains or interbasin transfers which may connect to the trunk main shall not be included in the reimbursement for trunk main extension. 
(c)  Forfeiture of trunk main reimbursement. It shall be the sole responsibility of the subdivider due reimbursement under this section to maintain his/her current address on file with the city administrator. Should a reimbursement be payable and the subdivider cannot be contacted at the address on file in the city administrator's office, the right to a reimbursement under this section shall lapse 24 months after the date of the initial attempt to contact the subdivider and the subdivider shall forfeit all claims to the reimbursement. The city may utilize all forfeited reimbursements for any purpose related to the water and sewer systems as determined by the city council. 
(d)  New subdivider's contribution for trunk main extension. When a new subdivider's water and sewer mains are to be connected to trunk mains installed by prior subdividers that meet the requirements of this section, the new subdivider shall deliver to the city administrator, prior to final plat approval, a check for his/her portion of the trunk main based on the formula in subsection (b) above. The contribution shall be based on the trunk main unit cost per acre times the number of acres in the subject subdivision. It shall be the new subdivider's responsibility to provide the city staff with evidence of the acreage involved.

If the notice to the owner or a lienholder is returned by the post office unclaimed, notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the vehicle was left in storage is sufficient notice.

If the gross proceeds are less than $10.00, the department shall retain the $10.00 to defray expenses of custody and auction.

Surplus proceeds remaining from an auction shall be distributed in accordance with section 106-136. 
(e)  Except for the termination or limitation of claim for storage for failure to report an abandoned motor vehicle, nothing in this section may be construed to impair any lien of a garagekeeper under the laws of this state. 
(f)  The police department shall send notice to the owner of a vehicle by certified mail. The notice shall direct the owner to pick up the vehicle. If the notice is returned by the post office unclaimed, notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the vehicle was left in storage is sufficient.

ARTICLE V. - IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM 

Sec. 110-121. - Program adoption. 
    The city developed this identity theft prevention program ("program") pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Red Flags Rule ("rule"), which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, 16 C.F.R. § 681.2. This program was developed for the utility department of the city ("utility") with oversight and approval of the city council. After consideration of the size and complexity of the utility's operations and account systems, and the nature and scope of the utility's activities, the city council determined that this program was appropriate for the city's utility, and therefore approved this program on October 21, 2008. 
(Ord. No. 2009-002, § 2, Exh. A(I), 10-21-08) 
Sec. 110-122. - Purpose and definitions. 
(a)  Establish an identity theft prevention program. To establish an identity theft prevention program designed to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or an existing covered account and to provide for continued administration of the program in compliance with part 681 of title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations implementing sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) of 2003. 
(b)  Establishing and fulfilling requirements of the red flags rule. The red flags rule ("rule") defines "identity theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person" and a "red flag" ("red flag") as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft. 
    Under the rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its operation. The program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to: 
(1)  Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; 
(2)  Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; 
(3)  Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 
(4)  Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft. 
(c)  Red flags rule definitions used in this program. 
    City: The City of Castroville, Texas. 
    Covered account: Under the rule, a "covered account" is: 
(1)  Any account the utility offers or maintains primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions; and 
(2)  Any other account the utility offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the utility from identity theft. 
    Creditors: The rule defines creditors "to include finance companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and telecommunications companies. Where nonprofit and government entities defer payment for goods or services, they, too, are to be considered creditors." 
    Identifying information is defined under the rule as "any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person," including: name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, computer's internet protocol address, or routing code. 
    Program: The identity theft prevention program for the city. 
    Program administrator: The utility director is the program administrator for the program. 
    Utility: The utility is the utility department for the city. 
(Ord. No. 2009-002, § 2, Exh. A(II), 10-21-08) 
Sec. 110-123. - Identification of red flags. 
    In order to identify relevant red flags, the utility considers the types of accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous experiences with identity theft.

d.  Application for service that appears to have been altered or forged. 
(3)  Suspicious personal identifying information. 
Red flags. 
a.  Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other information the customer provides (example: inconsistent birth dates, lack of correlation between social security number range and date of birth); 
b.  Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other sources of information (for instance, social security number or an address not matching an address on a credit report); 
c.  Identifying information presented that is the same as information shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent;

(Ord. No. 2009-002, § 2, Exh. A(V), 10-21-08) 
Sec. 110-126. - Program updates. 
    This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the utility from identity theft. At least annually, the program administrator will consider the utility's experiences with identity theft situation, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts the utility maintains and changes in the utility's business arrangements with other entities, consult with law enforcement authorities, and consult with other city personnel. After considering these factors, the program administrator will determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the program administrator will update the program or present the city council with his or her recommended changes and the city council will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the program. 
(Ord. No. 2009-002, § 2, Exh. A(VI), 10-21-08) 
Sec. 110-127. - Program administration. 
(a)  Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies with an identity theft committee for the utility. The committee is headed by a program administrator who may be the head of the utility or his or her appointee. Two or more other individuals appointed by the head of the utility or the program administrator comprise the remainder of the committee membership. The program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of utility staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program. 
(b)  Staff training and reports. Initially, all utility staff shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected. Thereafter, all utility staff shall undergo update training not less than annually. Additionally, all new utility employees shall undergo training. 
    All utility staff shall submit reports monthly concerning the utility's compliance with the program, the training that has been given and the effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft, including recommendations for changes to the program. While incidents of identity theft are to be reported immediately to the program administrator, the monthly reports shall contain a recap of the incident and include the steps taken to assist with resolution of the incident. 
(c)  Service provider arrangements. In the event the utility engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, including but not limited to franchise utility providers, the utility will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. 
(1)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and 
(2)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers review the utility's program and report any red flags to the program administrator. 
(d)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the utility's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices are to be limited to the identity theft committee and those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

Section 10. Group Housing
In instances where more than one Residential building is permitted on a site, all such buildings shall be
erected and maintained in conformity with a development plan which shall clearly indicate and depict the
following relative to the location and arrangement of such buildings as well as their attendant facilities on
the site:
(
(1) The size, height, spacing, extent of use, access and circulation for vehicles and pedestrians, (
relationship to easement and/or to streets, parking areas, yards, and open spaces, landscape treatment, and
the general relationship of the development to adjacent property.
(2) Dimensions and other pertinent information relative to the arrangement that may be deemed
necessary with respect to the supplying of municipal facilities or services and/or maintenance.
In all districts permitting more than one residential building on a site, the minimum horizontal.dl.stance(s)
between any two buildings (referred to as building A and building B) shall vary according to the length
and height of such buildings. Such minimum distances, except as may be provided for elsewhere in this
section, shall be the distance required under the following formula:
LA plus LB plus 2 (HA plus HB)
S==-------------------------------------where:
6
S== required minimum horizontal distance
Between any wall, or the imaginary extension thereof, of Building A, at any given level, and any
wall, or the extension thereof, of Building B, at any given level.
LA== effective length of Building A
The effective length of Building A is the length of that portion of its wall, or walls, from which
perpendicular lines drawn in a horizontal plane will intersect any wall of Building B. Where
Building A has a curved or irreguiar surface, such surface shall be enclosed within an imaginary
rectangle having its side nearest to Building B parallel with Building B, and all measurements
shall be made from said imaginary rectangle.

rectangle having its side nearest to Building A parallel with Building A, and all measurements
shall be made to said imaginary rectangle.
HA= height of Building A
The height of Building A is the height above natural grade of any portion of any wall at any given
level along the effective length of Building A.
HB= height of Building B
The height of Building B is the height above natural grade of any portion of any wall at any given
level along the effective length of Building B.

Section 17. Zoning Districts Established.
The City of Castroville is hereby divided into eleven (11) zoning districts. The use, height and area
regulations as set out herein are uniform within each district. The eleven districts established are herein
described and shall be known as:
(1) R-A, Single-Family Dwelling District: This district comprises the preponderant portion
of the existing housing development in the City of Castroville, and in addition, is- considered to be the
proper classification for large areas of the undeveloped land remaining in the City either as an interim or
pennanent zoning. This district is intended to be composed of single-family dwellings together with public
schools, churches and public parks and other uses of a similar and compatible nature as pennitted by this
Ordinance which are essential to create basic neighborhood units. The single-family district is not
intended to be subject to major alterations by future amendment except where changed conditions might
justify such action, or where minor adjustments in the boundaries of a district may be appropriate in order
to realize a reasonable development of the land.
(2) R-C. General Residence District: This district is intended to be applied to areas
containing a mixture of single-family, two-family and multiple-family dwellings. Districts are intended to
be located near commercial and industrial areas and other types of activity and employment centers where
they will serve both the City's housing needs and as transition areas between heavy traffic generators and
single-family dwelling districts. The regulations of this Ordinance are designed to protect the residential
character and to prevent the over-crowding of land by providing minimum standards for building spacing,
yards, off-street parking and building coverage. The building height permitted in this district shall be a
maximum height of thirty (30) feet or two and a half (2 \6) stmies.
(3) P-D, Planned Development District: This district is intended to be applied to areas of the
City (e.g.: subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance) where it can be determined that the approval of
an overall development plan presented by a petitioner will result in appropriate land use which will be of
benefit to the City in terms of compatibility of use, as well as timeliness and orderliness of development,
while offering a developer flexibility in terms of regulatory controls applicable to "single purpose
development".
(4) H-E, Historical District: This district is intended for application where there exists in the
City of Castroville areas and places of cultural and historical importance which are of local, state and
national significance. The areas are characterized by the existence of a substantial number of homes,
buildings, laodmarks and other historic places constructed and established by the founders and early
settlers of Castroville, many of which are of log, stone and frame construction in the style connnonly
(
(
referred to as Alsatian, German or Early Texas and Victorian. These buildings and places exist in (
significant quantity and concentrations within the City and establish a unique historic character which ·
establishes the necessity for historic zoning districts.
CZ0-18
(5) C-F. Neighborhood Business District: This district allows retail type uses which are of
a convenience nature to residential areas having proximity. The C-F District is intended to be applied at
the intersections of major thoroughfares and/or collector streets.
(6) C-G, (Historic) Central Business District: This district is comprised of numerous
historic structures and landmarks. This district is subject to the provisions of Article IV, Section Two (2)
as to permitted uses and regulatory control. The building height permitted in this district shall be a
maximum height of thirty (30) feet or two and a half(2 Y:i) stories.
(7) C-H, West Commercial District: This district shall begin at the Western City limits of the
City and shall run eastwardly the length of Highway 90 to Constantinople street. The northern and
southern boundaries of the district are as shown on the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance Map ofthe City
of Castroville. This district shall permit a wide variety of commercial uses intended to serve the entire
community and includes the strip commercial areas which have developed along the major thoroughfares
and highway in the City of Castroville. The maximum building height permitted in this area is forty (40)
feet or three (3) stories.
(8) C-H. Central Commercial District: This district shall begin with Constantinople street on
the west and shall run eastwardly along Highway 90 to the Medina River. The northern and southern
boundaries of this district are as shown on the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance Map of the City of
Castroville. This district shall provide a wide variety of commercial uses intended to serve the entire
community. The maximum building height permitted in this area is thirty (30) feet or two and a half (2
Yz) stories.
(9) C-H, East Commercial District: This district shall begin at the Medina River and shall
run eastwardly along Highway 90 and shall end at the eastern City limit. The northern and southern
boundaries of this district are as shown on the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance Map of the City of
Castroville. This district shall permit a wide variety of commercial uses intended to serve the entire
community and includes the strip commercial areas which have developed along the major thoroughfares
and highway in the City of Castroville. The maximum building height permitted in this area is forty ( 40)
feet or three (3) stories.
(10) I-I. Industrial District: By its nature, the district is intended for application in areas where
uses of an industrial nature that do not emit noxious odors, noises, dust, smoke and vibrations will be
compatible with other districts having proximity.
(11) M -I-I, Manufactured Home Park: This district is intended to be applied to areas of the
City where use of the land is dictated by previous use or previous zoning for Manufactured Home Park,
obtained by Gilliam Mobile Home Park and excluding all others, for areas where the establishment of a
Manufactured Home Park will provide additional economical housing for the citizens of the community
and where such development may be appropriate in order to realize a reasonable development of vacant
land within the City.

within fifteen (15) days' time after the decision has been rendered by the administrative officer, by filing
with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board of Adjustment, a notice of appeal,
specifying the grouods thereof. The officer, from whom the appeal is taken, shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken.
An appeal shall stay all proceedings of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal
is taken, certified to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him
that, by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to
life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed, otherwise, than by a restraining order,

depositing a notice properly addressed and postage paid in the United States Post Office to such property
owners as the ownership appears on the City's most recent tax roll.
Section 3. Powers.
(1) To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in auy order, requirement,
decision, or determination, made by au administrative official in the enforcement of this ordinance.
(2) To authorize, upon appeal in special cases, such variances from the terms of the ordinance
as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to such special conditions, the literal
enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance shall be substantially preserved.
a. The Board of Adjustment shall not grant a Variance from the provisions or
requirements of this ordinance unless it finds that the following facts and
conditions exist:
a:l That a variance is a means of relief which is available only when some
peculiar circumstance as to the size or shape of the parcel of land (and
sometimes its location) is such that the literal application of the
provisions of the Ordinance would impair the owner's rights to some
reasonable use of the property. A variance shall not be granted unless, in
the first place, there are such peculiar circumstances.
a:2 That the circumstances which cause the hardship must be peculiar to the
property in question, or to such a small number of properties that they
clearly constitute marked exceptions to the property in the neighborhood.
If the circumstances cited as a basis for applying for the variance are
common to the property in the neighborhood, the variance shall not be
granted.
a:3 That after establishing the peculiar circumstance applying to the property
in question, it shall be determined that the variance is required in order to
preserve a substantial property right of the petitioner. It is of no moment
whatever that the denial of the variance might deny to the property owner
some opportunity to use his property in a more profitable way or to sell it
at a greater profit than is possible under the terms of the Ordinance. The
owner is entitled only to a reasonable use of his property.
a:4 That any alleged hardship is not self-created by any person having an
interest in the property nor is the result of mere disregard for or ignorance
of the provisions of this Ordinance.
a:5 That the regulations to which the variance is sought shall be modified as
little as possible so that the substantial intent and purpose of the
regulations shall be preserved. The granting of the variance should be
made subject to such conditions as will constitute to this end.
CZ0-55
a:6 That the variance will not result in substantial detriment to adjacent
property nor the surrounding neighborhood, and will not be materially
·detrimental to the public welfare.
a:7 The Board shall carefully distinguish between a use change and a
variance. A use change shall be subject to the provisions ofthe Ordinance·
applicable to a change in Zoning District Classification.
b. The grant of a variance by the Board shall be by resolution. The granting of a
variance shall not be by an ordinance amending the Comprehensive Zoning
Ordinance.
c. In connection with any recommendation by the Board for the granting· of a
variance, the Board shall include any conditions, requirements or limitations to be
attached to the variance, which the Board may find to be necessary and desirable
to protect adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhood, and to carry out
the purposes and objectives of this Ordinance.
*d The Board of Adjustment shall not take action upon an application for variance
for any property located in a Historical District until it has referred the request to
the Historic Review Board and received recommendation or a certificate from the
Board showing failure to take action.
(3) In exercising its powers, the Board may, in conformity with the provisions of ARTICLE
1011-A and including 1011-J of the 1925 Civil Statutes of Texas, revise or reform, wholly or partly, or
may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made and shall have all the
powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken; said decision of the Board is to be consistent with
the provisions of (2) above relating to the exercise of its powers.
(4) The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board shall be necessary to revise any
order, requirement, decision or determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of
the application on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance or to affect any
variance in said ordinance.
(5) Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the Board of
Adjustment, any taxpayer, any officer, or department of the Municipality, may present to a court of record,
a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the
grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within ten (I 0) days after the filing
of the decision of the Office of the Board and not thereafter.
* Any provision contained in the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance that are inconsistent
with this amendment are hereby repealed.
