PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of South Hill, Virginia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1974 Code and ordinances adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1974 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Bryan D. Foster, former Director of Municipal Services, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

(b)  Any animal warden who has reason to believe that a canine or canine crossbreed within his jurisdiction is a dangerous dog or vicious dog shall apply to the judge of the district court for the issuance of a summons requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear before a general district court at a specified time. The summons shall advise the owner of the nature of the proceeding and the matters at issue. The animal warden shall confine the animal until such time as evidence shall be heard and a verdict rendered. The court, through its contempt powers, may compel the owner, custodian or harborer of the animal to produce the animal. If after hearing the evidence the court finds that the animal is a dangerous dog, the court shall order the animal's owner to comply with the provisions of this section. If after hearing the evidence the court finds that the animal is a vicious dog, the court shall order the animal euthanized in accordance with the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 3.1-796.119. 
(c)  No canine or canine crossbreed shall be found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog solely because it is a particular breed, nor shall the local governing body prohibit the ownership of a particular breed of canine or canine crossbreed.

The animal warden shall also provide the owner with a uniformly designed tag identifying the animal as a dangerous dog.

All certificates obtained pursuant to this section shall be renewed annually for the same fee and in the same manner as the initial certificate was obtained. 
(e)  All certificates or renewals thereof required to be obtained under this section shall only be issued to persons 18 years of age or older who present satisfactory evidence of the animal's current rabies vaccination, if applicable, and that the animal is and will be confined in a proper enclosure or is and will be confined inside the owner's residence or is and will be muzzled and confined in the owner's fenced-in yard until the proper enclosure is constructed. In addition, owners who apply for certificates or renewals thereof under this section shall not be issued a certificate or renewal thereof unless they present satisfactory evidence that their residence is and will continue to be posted with clearly visible signs warning both minors and adults of the presence of a dangerous dog on the property and the animal has been permanently identified by means of a tattoo on the inside thigh or by electronic implantation.

When off its owner's property, an animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog shall be kept on a leash and muzzled in such a manner as not to cause injury to the animal or interfere with the animal's vision or respiration, but so as to prevent it from frightening, attacking or biting a person or another domestic animal. 
(g)  If the owner of an animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog is a minor, the custodial parent or legal guardian shall be responsible for complying with all requirements of this section. 
(h)  After an animal has been found by a court to be a dangerous dog, the animal's owner shall immediately, upon learning of same, notify the local animal control authority if the animal is loose or unconfined; bites a person or attacks another domestic animal; is sold, given away or dies; or has been moved to a different address. 
(i)  The owner of any animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog who willfully fails to comply with the requirements of this section shall be guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor, punishable as provided in section 1-15. 
(j)  All fees collected pursuant to this section, less the costs incurred by the animal control authority in producing and distributing the certificates and tags required by this section, shall be paid into a special dedicated fund in the town treasury for the purpose of paying the expenses of any training course required under Code of Virginia, § 3.1-796.105.

The plan approving authority, in considering the adequacy of a submitted plan, shall be guided by the same standards, regulations and guidelines. When the standards vary between the publications, the state regulations shall take precedence. 
(d)  The plan approving authority shall, within 45 days, approve any such plan, if it is determined that the plan meets the requirements of the local control program, and if the person responsible for carrying out the plan certifies that he will properly perform the erosion and sediment control measures included in the plan and will conform to the provisions of this article. In addition, as a prerequisite to engaging in the land disturbing activities shown on the approved plan, the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence to the program authority, as provided by Code of Virginia, § 10.1-561, who will be in charge of and responsible for carrying out the land disturbing activity. Failure to provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence prior to engaging in land disturbing activities may result in revocation of the approval of the plan and the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be subject to the penalties provided in this article. 
(e)  The plan shall be acted upon within 45 days from the receipt thereof by either approving the plan in writing or by disapproving the plan in writing and giving specific reasons for its disapproval. 
(f)  When a plan is determined to be inadequate, written notice of disapproval stating the specific reasons for disapproval shall be communicated to the applicant within 45 days. The notice shall specify the modifications, terms and conditions that will permit approval of the plan. If no action is taken by the plan approving authority within the time specified above, the plan shall be deemed approved and the person authorized to proceed with the proposed activity. 
(g)  An approved plan may be changed by the plan approving authority when: 
(1)  The inspection reveals that the plan is inadequate to satisfy applicable regulations; or 
(2)  The person responsible for carrying out the plan finds that because of changed circumstances or for other reasons the approved plan cannot be effectively carried out, and proposed amendments to the plan, consistent with the requirements of this article, are agreed to by the plan approving authority and the person responsible for carrying out the plans. 
(h)  In order to prevent erosion, the town may require approval of a conservation plan for any land identified in the local program as an erosion impact area. 
(i)  For the purposes of subsections (a) and (d) above, when land disturbing activity will be required of a contractor performing construction work pursuant to a construction contract, the preparation, submission, and approval of an erosion and sediment control plan shall be the responsibility of the owner. 
(j)  Whenever electric and telephone utility companies or railroad companies undertake any of the activities included in subsections (1) and (2) below, they shall be considered exempt from the provisions of this article. However, they shall file general erosion and sediment control specifications annually with the board. 
(1)  Construction, installation and maintenance of electric and telephone utility lines; and 
(2)  Construction of the tracks, rights-of-way, bridges, communication facilities and other related structures and facilities of the railroad company. 
Projects not included in subsections (1) and (2) above shall comply with the requirements of the town erosion and sediment control program, pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 10.1-563D. 
State agency projects are exempt from the provisions of this article except as provided for in Code of Virginia, § 10.1-564. 
(k)  Any person engaging in the creation and operation of wetland mitigation banks in multiple jurisdictions, which have been approved and are operated in accordance with applicable federal and state guidance, laws, or regulations for the establishment, use, and operation of mitigation banks, pursuant to a permit issued by the Department of Environmental Quality, the Marine Resources Commission, or the U.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2016-5, adopted Nov. 14, 2016, added provisions to the Code but did not specify manner of inclusion. Therefore, at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been included as Art. XIII herein. 

Sec. 50-831. - Purpose. 
    Malfunctioning alarm systems and the false alerts and alarms associated with them constitute a hazard to public safety personnel and to the public in general. The regulation of false alarms is critical to ensuring the health, safety and welfare of town citizens. False alerts of fire, intrusions, robberies and other safety related events increase the town's public safety costs, divert public safety resources from other critical areas of work, and burden the Mecklenburg Emergency Communications Center. In order to preserve the integrity and efficiency of the town's law enforcement and fire emergency services, those who utilize automatic alarm systems must be required to maintain those systems in good working order and to promptly repair defects which may cause those systems to trigger false alarms. 
(Ord. No. 2016-5, 11-14-16)

ARTICLE IV. - ADDITIONS TO TOWN STREET SYSTEM 

Sec. 70-166. - General policy as to street additions. 
(a)  Street additions to the town maintained secondary system will be considered when requested where the proposed streets provide sufficient public service to warrant the expenditure of street funds for maintenance and improvement thereof; provided, however, that a minimum 50-foot unrestricted right-of-way plus additional widths for cuts and fills where necessary, along with adequate drainage easements, are established and recorded in the deed books of the county at no cost to the town. 
(b)  Streets platted and recorded prior to June 18, 1968, may be developed with town funds and forces together with providing water and sewage provided the guideline criteria described in section 70-167 are adhered to. 
(Code 1974, § 27-42) 
Sec. 70-167. - Guideline criteria which may indicate sufficient public service to warrant the addition of a street to the town maintained secondary system. 
(a)  Anticipated traffic should be of sufficient volume and of sufficiently varied proprietorship to warrant public necessity. 
(b)  A street should serve at least three occupied dwellings per 1,000 feet of street. 
(c)  The fact that the road will be a school bus or mail route could bear upon the public need. 
(d)  Roads leading to public landings and public recreational areas are considered as giving public service. 
(e)  Connecting streets, even though devoid of adjacent development, can be given consideration provided the desired line of traffic and the amount of traffic are sufficient to warrant the expenditure of public funds. 
(f)  Any one or a combination of the items noted in subsections (a)-(e) of this section could indicate public service; and there are also many other situations that could exist which would in turn so indicate, such as roads leading to historical shrines owned by nonprofit organizations and/or governmental agencies and many others. In every case, however, the cost in relation to the service shall be the final determining factor. 
(Code 1974, § 27-43) 
Sec. 70-168. - Additions in subdivisions. 
(a)  Generally. 
(1)  Addition of subdivision streets constructed after June 18, 1968, to the town secondary system will be approved only when these streets are constructed to standards established by the council. 
(2)  The streets must render a public service as determined in the guideline criteria in section 70-167. 
(3)  The streets must have been properly maintained since completion. 
(4)  The developer must furnish the town a bond in sufficient amount to guarantee the satisfactory performance of the streets for a period of one year from the time of acceptance; or, as an alternative, the developer may construct the streets under town inspection, the cost of the inspection to be borne by him. 
(b)  Procedures. 
(1)  The developer will submit plans to the town office showing: 
a.  The complete drainage layout, including all pipe sizes, types, drainage easements and means of transporting the drainage to a well-defined open stream that is considered natural drainage. 
b.  A cross section showing the proposed street construction, depth and type of base, and type of surface. 
c.  A profile or contour map showing the proposed grades for the streets and drainage facilities. 
d.  It is not intended that the subdivider submit to the town a blank map and that the town put on the drainage, plan the grades, etc. The town will check these; however, the original work must be done by his engineers who are authorized to do such work in accordance with law. 
(2)  Upon receipt of the plat and plans, the town manager shall study the layout thoroughly and determine if the plans as set forth comply with all requirements of the town, noting thereon any corrections he feels should be made. 
(3)  The town manager will return the corrected and approved plat to the developer, keeping one copy for his files, and shall in his letter of transmittal advise the developer of the corrections made. 
(c)  Minimum bond. The minimum bond shall be as determined by the town manager. 
(d)  Minimum requirements. Minimum requirements for subdivision streets to qualify for addition to the town secondary system shall be as provided in the subdivision regulations, § 74-221 et seq. If the street is to become a part of an arterial system, the standards would of necessity be correspondingly higher.

    Prior to issuance of any permit, if required, the applicant shall be required to submit a reasonable performance bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit, any combination thereof, or such other legal arrangement acceptable to the town attorney, to ensure that measures could be taken by the Town of South Hill at the applicant's expense should he fail, after proper notice, within the time specified to initiate or maintain appropriate actions which may be required of him by the permit conditions as a result of his land-disturbing activity. If the Town of South Hill takes such action upon such failure by the applicant, the town may collect from the applicant for the difference should the amount of the reasonable cost of such action exceed the amount of the security held, if any. Within 60 days of the completion of the requirements of the permit conditions, such bond, cash escrow, letter of credit or other legal arrangement, or the unexpended or unobligated portion thereof, shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 74.1-1. - Title and purpose. 
(a)  Title. This chapter shall be known as the Land Subdivision and Development Ordinance of the Town of South Hill, Virginia. For brevity, this chapter is and may be cited as the "subdivision ordinance." 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish certain subdivision standards and procedures for the town and such of its environs as come under the jurisdiction of the council as provided for by state law. These regulations are established in pursuit of a long-range plan to guide and facilitate the orderly beneficial growth of the community, and to promote the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare. More specifically, the purposes of these standards and procedures are to: 
(1)  Provide a guide for the change that occurs when lands and acreage become urban in character as a result of development for residential, business or industrial purposes; 
(2)  Provide assurance that the purchasers of lots are buying a commodity that is suitable for development and use; and 
(3)  Make possible the provision of public services in a safe, adequate and efficient manner. 
    Subdivided land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and numerous public services customary to urban areas must be provided. This chapter assists the town in meeting these responsibilities. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-2. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this chapter, the definitions set out in chapter 99.1 and all of the conditions related thereto shall apply when the words or terms defined therein appear in this chapter. [2]

Sec. 74.1-3. - Mutual responsibility. 
    There is a mutual responsibility between the subdivider and the town to divide the land so as to improve the general use pattern of the land being subdivided. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-4. - Land must be suitable. 
    The agent shall not approve the subdivision of land if from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not suitable for platting and development purposes of the kind proposed. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-5. - Flooding and unsuitable topography. 
    Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase danger of health, life or property, or aggravate erosion or flood hazards. Such land within the subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for such uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce conditions contrary to public welfare. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-6. - Improvements. 
    All required improvements shall be installed by the subdivider at his cost. In cases where the state department of transportation or county requirements are lacking or less restrictive than the requirements of this chapter, the requirements of this chapter shall prevail. The subdivider's bond shall not be released until construction has been inspected and approved by the appropriate engineer. All improvements shall be in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-7. - Conformance with chapter required. 
    The regulations in this chapter are adopted for the subdivision of land within the corporate limits of the town and within two miles of the corporate limits in the county as defined in the Code of Virginia and as depicted on the map on file in the agent's office and attached to this chapter from and after the effective date of this chapter. Every owner or proprietor of any tract of land to which this chapter applies who subdivides such tract as provided in this chapter shall cause a plat of such subdivisions developed and prepared in accordance with this chapter, with reference to known or permanent monuments, to be made and recorded in the office of the clerk of the court wherein deeds conveying such land are required by law to be recorded. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-8. - Exceptions. 
(a)  Where the subdivider can show that a provision of the standards in this chapter would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to, and where, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, in the opinion of the agent, a departure may be made without destroying the intent of such provisions, the agent may authorize an exception upon approval by the planning commission. Any exception thus authorized is to be stated in writing in the report of the agent with the reasoning on which the departure was justified set forth. No such exception may be granted by this chapter which is opposed in writing by the town agent or health official. 
(b)  The agent may permit the separation of one parcel from a tract of land without complying with all requirements of this chapter provided that: 
(1)  It is not in conflict with the general meaning and purpose of this chapter; 
(2)  No new street is required to serve the parcel; 
(3)  The parcel or tract to be separated as well as the residual parcel remaining after the separation shall meet the minimum area and other dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which both parcels are located.

ARTICLE II. - MAKING AND RECORDING PLATS 

Sec. 74.1-30. - Procedure in general.

(2)  Following the discussion of the sketch plan or in lieu thereof, a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision may be prepared and submitted to the agent who, in turn, causes a thorough review to be made by all appropriate persons and agencies who are required to review subdivision. 
(3)  Upon receiving approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider then may prepare and submit for review a final plat together with the required documentation and site development and engineering plans as required by this chapter. 
(4)  After receiving the required approvals of the site development and engineering plans, the subdivider will provide acceptable sureties to the town that guarantee the successful completion of the subdivision according to the approved plans and plats.

No such plat of subdivision shall be recorded unless it shall have been submitted, approved and certified by the agent in accordance with the regulations set forth in this chapter. No lot shall be sold in any such subdivision before the plat shall have been recorded. 
(b)  Certification. Every subdivision plat which is intended for recording shall be prepared by a certified professional engineer or land surveyor, who shall endorse upon each plat a certificate signed by him or her setting forth the source of title of the owner of the land subdivided and the place of record of the last instrument in the chain of title. When the plat is of land acquired from more than one source of title, the outlines of the several tracts shall be indicated upon the plat. Nothing herein, however, shall be deemed to prohibit the preparation of preliminary studies, plans or plats of a proposed subdivision by the owner of the land, city planners, land planners architects, landscape architects or others having training or experience in subdivision planning and design (Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2262). 
_____
(c)  Owners statement. Every such plat, or the deed of dedication to which plat is attached, shall contain in addition to the surveyor's or engineers's certificate a statement to the following effect: 
"the above and foregoing subdivision of 
____________ 
(here insert correct description of the land subdivided) 
as appears in the plat 
is with the free consent and in accordance with the desire 
of the undersigned owners, proprietors, and trustees, if any, 
____________  
    Such plat and certificate shall be duly acknowledged before some officer authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds, and when thus executed and approved as herein specified shall be filed and recorded in the office of the clerk of the circuit court, and indexed under the names of the landowners signing such statement and under the name of the subdivision. 
_____
(d)  No one exempt. No person shall subdivide any tract of land that is located within the town or within two miles of the corporate limits in the county except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

When this chapter calls for more restrictive standards than are required by private contracts, the provisions of this chapter shall control. 
(f)  Changes on plat prohibited. No change, erasure or revision shall be made on any preliminary or final plat, nor on accompanying data sheets after approval of the agent has been endorsed in writing on the plat or sheets, unless authorization for such changes has been granted in writing by the agent.

(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-32. - Preliminary sketch plan. 
    The subdivider may, if he so chooses, submit to the agent a preliminary sketch of the proposed subdivision prior to his preparation of engineered preliminary and final plats. The purpose of such preliminary sketch is to permit the agent to advise the subdivider whether his plans in general are in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The agent, and in appropriate cases, the planning commission, upon submission of any preliminary sketch, shall study it and advise the subdivider wherein it appears that changes would be necessary. The agent may mark the preliminary sketch indicating necessary changes, and any such marked sketch shall be returned with the preliminary plat. The preliminary sketch shall be as follows: 
(1)  How drawn? It shall be drawn on white paper or on a print of a topographic map of the property. It shall be drawn to a minimum scale of 100 feet to the inch. It shall show the name, location and dimensions of all streets entering the property, adjacent to the property, or terminating at the boundary of the property to be subdivided.

This sketch is merely for informational purposes and is not binding on the subdivider or the council. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-33. - Procedure for preliminary plat. 
(a)  General procedure. The agent or his appointed representative and, in appropriate cases, the planning commission shall discuss the preliminary plat with the subdivider in order to determine whether or not the preliminary plat generally conforms to the requirements of this chapter and of the zoning ordinance (chapter 94.1 of this revised Code). If the proposed subdivision is outside the corporate limits of the town, but within the two-mile limit as depicted on the map that is a part of this chapter, the subdivider shall at the time present to the agent and planning commission one copy of preliminary plat that has been approved by the county's subdivision agent. The subdivider shall then be advised in writing within 45 days, which may be by formal letter or by legible markings on his copy of the preliminary plat, concerning: 
(1)  Any additional data that may be required; 
(2)  The character and extent of public improvements, if any, that will have to be made according to this chapter; 
(3)  An estimate of the cost of construction of any proposed improvements; 
(4)  The amount of the performance bond which will be required as a prerequisite to approval of the final subdivision plat. In determining the cost of required improvements and the amount of the performance bond, the agent may require a bona fide estimate of the cost of improvements to be furnished by the subdivider. 
(b)  Procedure for filing where land is within corporate limits. When the preliminary plat is of land within the corporate limits of the town: 
(1)  The subdivider shall submit to the agent three prints of a preliminary layout at a minimum scale of 100 feet to the inch, one of which shall be retained by the agent until the final plat is approved. 
(2)  The agent shall then arrange for a meeting with the commission and the subdivider to discuss the plat and note any changes on all three copies. 
(3)  The agent and, in cases where the planning commission is required to review the preliminary subdivision plat, the commission chairman shall sign approval of all three copies and return two copies to the subdivider. 
(4)  The subdivider shall submit the plat to the county health department if town water and sewer are not to be provided. 
(5)  The subdivider shall submit the plat to the state department of transportation, South Hill district office, if directed to do so by the agent. 
(6)  The subdivider shall upon submission of a preliminary plat deposit payment of the amount on file in the town clerk's office with the town treasurer as the fee charged for preliminary plat review. An additional fee will be due with final plat submission. 
(c)  Procedure for filing when land is outside corporate limits. When the preliminary plat is of land situated outside the corporate limits of the town but within two miles of the corporate limits and within the boundaries depicted on the map that is part of this chapter: 
(1)  The subdivider shall submit to the agent three prints of a preliminary layout at a minimum scale of 100 feet to the inch, one of which shall be retained by the agent until final plat is approved. 
(2)  The agent shall then arrange a meeting with the planning commission and the subdivider to discuss the plat and note any changes on all copies. 
(3)  The agent and the commission chairman shall sign approval on all copies and return two copies to the subdivider. 
(4)  The subdivider shall submit the plat to the county health department. 
(5)  The subdivider shall submit the plat to the state department of transportation, South Hill district office. 
(6)  The subdivider shall upon submission of a preliminary plat deposit payment of the amount on file in the town clerk's office with the town treasurer as the fee charged. No additional per lot fee is charged for outside corporate limits subdivisions. 
(7)  The subdivider shall submit back to the agent the preliminary plat as approved by and signed by the county administrator. 
(d)  No guarantee. Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute a guarantee of approval of a final plat. 
(e)  Time frame to pursue final plat. Once a preliminary subdivision plat is approved, it shall be valid for a period of five years, provided that the subdivider (i) submits a final subdivision plat for all or a portion of the property within one year of such approval, and (ii) thereafter diligently pursues approval of the final subdivision plat. Diligent pursuit of approval means that the subdivider has incurred extensive obligations or substantial expenses relating to the submitted final subdivision plat or modifications thereto. However, no sooner than three years following such preliminary plat approval, and upon ninety days written notice by certified mail to the subdivider, the commission or other agent may revoke such approval upon a specific finding of facts that the subdivider has not diligently pursued approval of the final subdivision plat.

For those subdivisions lying outside the corporate limits, the minimum lot size shall be in conformance with the requirements of the county's subdivision ordinance. 
(b)  Exceptions. Greater lot areas may be required where individual septic tank or individual wells are used if the health official determines that there are factors of drainage, soil condition or other conditions to cause potential health problems. The agent shall require that data from percolation tests be submitted as a basis for passing upon subdivisions dependent upon septic tanks as a means of sewage disposal. 
(c)  Shape of lots. The lot arrangement, design and shape shall be such that lots will provide satisfactory and desirable sites for buildings, be properly related to topography, and conform to requirements of this chapter. Lots shall not contain peculiarly shaped elongations solely to provide necessary square footage of area that would be unusable for normal purposes. Lots shall not contain peculiarly shaped elongations solely to provide access to a street that is publicly dedicated or will become publicly dedicated through the construction of the subdivision. 
(d)  Location of lots on a street. Each lot shall abut on a street dedicated by the subdivision plat, or on an existing publicly dedicated street, or on a street that has become public by right of use. If the existing streets are not 50 feet in width, the subdivider shall make provisions in the deeds to lots for all buildings to be so constructed as to permit the widening by dedication of such roads or streets to a width of 50 feet. 
(e)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient for maintenance of any required building lines on both streets as determined by the zoning ordinance (chapter 94.1 of this Code). 
(f)  Side lines of lots. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles or radial to the street line. At the dead-end of a street that terminates in a turn-around, the lot lines shall generally be radial to the center of the turn-around at the end of such street except in cases where temporary turn-arounds are provided to allow for the future extension of the street. 
(g)  Remnants of lots. All remnants of lots below the minimum size left over after subdividing of a tract must be added to adjacent lots, or otherwise disposed of rather than allowed to remain an unusable parcels. 
(h)  Separate ownership of lots. Where the land covered by a subdivision includes two or more parcels in separate ownership, and lot arrangement is such that a property ownership divides one or more lots, the land in each lot so divided shall be transferred by deed to single ownership, simultaneously with the recording the final plat. This deed is to be deposited with the clerk of the court and held with the final plat until the subdivider is ready to record the plat, and they both shall then be recorded together. 
(i)  Location of lot corners. All lot corners other than at street corners shall be marked with concrete monuments not less than four inches square and not less than 15 inches in depth or iron pins not less than one-half inch in diameter and 24 inches long and driven so as to be flush with the finished grade. When rock is encountered, a hole shall be drilled four inches deep in the rock, into which shall be cemented a steel rod one-half inch in diameter, the top of which shall be flush with the finished grade line. 
(j)  Unusable land area. Not more than 20 percent of the minimum lot area required by the zoning ordinance shall be unusable by reason of location at an elevation below the 100-year flood level, in wetlands or other protected natural resource areas.

ARTICLE V. - STREETS AND OTHER RIGHTS-OF-WAY 

Sec. 74.1-221. - Street design generally. 
(a)  All streets in the proposed subdivision shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the minimum requirements of this article and other construction standards adopted by the town by the subdivider at no cost to the town. 
(b)  The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas. The street arrangement must be such as to cause no unnecessary hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient access to it. Where in the opinion of the agent it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary line of such property. Half streets along the boundary of land proposed for subdivision are not permitted. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-222. - Approach angle of major streets. 
    Wherever possible, streets should intersect at right angles. In all hillside areas, streets running with contours shall be required to intersect at angles of not less than 60 degrees unless approved by the agent. Major streets shall approach major or minor streets at an angle of not less than 80 degrees unless the agent, upon recommendation of the highway engineer, shall approve a lesser angle of approach for reasons of contour, terrain or matching of existing patterns. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2))

Sec. 74.1-224. - Grades. 
    The grades of streets submitted on subdivision plats shall be approved by the agent according to current state department of transportation standards. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-225. - Construction requirements generally. 
(a)  Conflicts with state, county specifications. In cases where state department of highways and transportation or county specifications are lacking or are less restrictive than the requirements of this chapter, this chapter shall prevail. 
(b)  Drainage. Drainage facilities and drainage structures, including off-site facilities when necessary to provide adequate drainage, shall be provided in accordance with the state department of highways and transportation's current location and design division drainage manual and current road designs and standards. 
(c)  Easements. Drainage easements shall be provided from all drainage outfalls to extend to a watercourse, defined as one where water has been accustomed to gather and flow along a well-defined channel, which by frequent running has worn or cut into the soil. In instances where developments divert more intensified runoff into existing town facilities to the extent that the facilities must be adjusted, such adjustments shall be at the developer's expense; and the developer will be required to furnish any additional easements thus required. In the event curb and gutter is required by the agent, then widths between faces of curbs shall be in accordance with current state department of transportation standards. 
(d)  Curb cut ramps. Curb cut ramps shall be required in accordance with state law. Curb-cut designs approved by the town shall be required for the use of this type of curb and gutter in each instance.

(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-227. - Hydraulic and hydrologic design. 
(a)  Hydraulic and drainage design, and the criteria to be used, shall be in accordance with the state department of transportation's drainage manual. All design criteria and methods of analysis shall be subject to approval by the town. A copy of the hydrologic and hydraulic design data and computations shall be submitted to the town at the same time as the plans are submitted for review. 
(b)  Documentation. All design data shall be properly recorded and shall include all pertinent data (survey, hydrology, hydraulic, floodplain studies) necessary to verify the design. 
(c)  Hydrology. Peak discharges shall be determined by methods appropriate for the size, location and character of the watersheds involved. Where floodplain reports have been prepared for the area, they shall be considered in the design. If these floodplains are affected by tides, tidal action reports shall be included. Appropriate design storm frequencies shall be utilized depending upon the risk of damage to both adjacent property and the roadway. Minimum design criteria applicable to the roadway may not be acceptable relative to adjacent property damage potential, thus requiring higher design criteria. 
(d)  Hydraulic design. No exact criteria for flood frequency or allowable headwater/backwater values can be set that will apply generally to various locations. In the hydraulic design of drainage structures, the following risk evaluations should be considered: 
(1)  Damage to adjacent property. 
(2)  Damage to the roadway and/or structure. 
(3)  Traffic interruption. 
(4)  Hazard to human life. 
(5)  Damage to stream and floodplain environment. 
    Hydraulic design and analysis techniques shall be appropriate for the type of structure or system of structures involved and may require flood profiles and water surface profile analysis. In areas involving floodplains, the federal flood insurance requirements relative to zoning and hydraulic design to accommodate the 100-year flood shall be considered. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-228. - Dams. 
    Whenever dams are to be utilized as roadways, an alternate way of ingress and egress open to the public must be provided. Plans for dams designated for such use shall be reviewed and approved by the town prior to construction. A formal agreement must be executed between the developer and the town regarding the relative responsibility of the maintenance of various elements prior to acceptance. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-229. - Guardrail. 
    A guardrail is a safety element that can serve as protection to the traveling public as well as protection to adjacent properties. When evaluating the need for guardrails within subdivisions, the total effect from the standpoint of safety should be the predominant consideration. However, guardrail types in common usage tend to be objectionable within residential subdivisions from an aesthetic point of view. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-230. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  Sidewalks are not a requirement of the town, but town policy provides for the acceptance of their maintenance whenever they are proposed, whether voluntarily or required by local ordinance, if they are located within dedicated right-of-way and constructed to the state department of transportation's standards on satisfactorily prepared subgrade. 
(b)  Any sidewalk that is constructed contiguous to a curb and gutter typical section shall be constructed of the state department of transportation's specification class P concrete at least four feet wide and four inches deep at appropriate grade so as to tie in compatibly with the curb and gutter. 
(c)  On rural-type typical sections, asphalt plant mix sidewalk will be acceptable when located back of a ditch line on cut sections and back of the guardrail on fill sections. Asphalt sidewalks shall be at least four feet wide and four inches deep at appropriate grade to tie in to the appropriate roadway element. Concrete sidewalks on rural typical sections will be acceptable only when constructed on the ultimate alignment and grade that would tie in to the eventual conversion to a curb and gutter section. Temporary sidewalks that meander horizontally and/or vertically relative to the roadway element may be permitted if they do not conflict with the roadway elements, but the town will not accept the maintenance of these. Therefore, any temporary sidewalks that do not qualify for state maintenance will have to be covered by permit to the extent that they encroach upon the right-of-way. The permit must clearly delineate the maintenance responsibility of the applicant, thus saving the town harmless from any possible liability. The applicant should be a county, corporate town or agency that has perpetual maintenance capability. These temporary sidewalks maintained by others may be asphalt plant mix, gravel or other stabilizer convenient to the applicant. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-231. - Intersections-Landings. 
    At all intersecting streets, a relatively flat landing should be provided on the side streets that have stop or yield situations. It should be of sufficient length to accommodate at least one vehicle, with additional length depending upon the projected traffic volume of the side street. 
(Ord. of 6-9-03(2)) 
Sec. 74.1-232. - Same-Site distances.

The word "profession" implies attainments in professional knowledge as distinguished from mere skill, and the application of knowledge to uses for others rather than for personal profit. 
    Purchases means all goods, wares and merchandise received for sale at each definite place of business of a wholesale merchant. The term shall also include the cost of manufacture of all goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by any wholesaler or wholesale merchant and sold or offered for sale.

(Ord. of 12-9-96, § C(b); Ord. of 3-8-10) 
Sec. 78-110. - License required. 
(a)  Every person engaging in any business, trade, profession, occupation or calling (collectively hereinafter referred to as "a business") as defined in section 78-106, unless otherwise exempted by law, shall apply for a license for each such business if such person maintains a definite place of business in this jurisdiction, such person does not maintain a definite office anywhere but does maintain an abode in this jurisdiction, which abode for the purposes of this article shall be deemed a definite place of business, or there is no definite place of business but such person operates amusement machines, is engaged as a peddler or itinerant merchant, carnival or circus as specified in Code of Virginia, §§ 58.1-3717, 58.1-3718, or 58.1-3728, or is a contractor subject to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715, or is a public service corporation subject to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3731. A separate license shall be required for each definite place of business.

(1)  Each business or profession is licensable at the location and has satisfied any requirements imposed by state law or other provisions of the ordinances of this jurisdiction;

(3)  The taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the assessor may require concerning the nature of the several businesses and their gross receipts. 
(Ord. of 12-9-96, § C(a)) 
Sec. 78-111. - When paid.

(Ord. of 12-9-96, § C(c) ; Ord. of 5-12-08) 
Sec. 78-112. - Extensions. 
    The assessing official may grant an extension of time, not to exceed 90 days, in which to file an application for a license, for reasonable cause. The extension shall be conditioned upon the timely payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax, subject to adjustment to the correct tax at the end of the extension, together with interest from the due date until the date paid and, if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under the circumstances, a penalty of ten percent of the portion paid after the due date. 
(Ord. of 12-9-96, § C(d)) 
Sec. 78-113. - Penalty. 
(a)  A penalty of ten percent of the tax required by this article may be imposed upon the failure to file an application or the failure to pay the tax by the appropriate due date. Only the late filing penalty shall be imposed by the assessing official if both the application and payment are late; however, both penalties may be assessed if the assessing official determines that the taxpayer has a history of noncompliance. 
(b)  In the case of an assessment of additional tax made by the assessing official, if the application and, if applicable, the return were made in good faith and the understatement of the tax was not due to any fraud, reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the additional tax. 
(c)  If any assessment of tax by the assessing official is not paid within 30 days, the treasurer may impose a ten percent late payment penalty. 
(d)  The penalties shall not be imposed, or if imposed, shall be abated by the official who assessed them if the failure to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer. In order to demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he acted responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his control. 
(e)  For purposes of this section: 
(1)  Acted responsibly means that: 
a.  The taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the business; and 
b.  The taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the failure, such as requesting appropriate extensions (where applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment, acting to remove an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a failure once the impediment was removed or the failure discovered. 
(2)  Events beyond the taxpayer's control include but are not limited to the unavailability of records due to fire or other casualty; the unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the taxpayer's reasonable reliance in good faith upon erroneous written information from the assessing official, who was aware of the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when he provided the erroneous information. 
(Ord. of 12-9-96, § C(e)) 
Sec. 78-114. - Interest on late payment. 
(a)  Interest shall be charged on the late payment of the tax required by this article from the due date until the date paid without regard to fault or other reason for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or omitted tax by the assessing official is found to be erroneous, all interest and penalty charged and collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous shall be refunded, together with interest on the refund from the date of payment or the due date, whichever is later. Interest shall be paid on the refund of any tax paid under this article from the date of payment or due date, whichever is later, whether attributable to an amended return or other reason. Interest on any refund shall be paid at the same rate charged under Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3916. 
(b)  No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability to actual liability at the conclusion of a base year. No interest shall be paid on a refund or charged on a late payment, in event of such adjustment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not more than 30 days from the date of the payment that created the refund, or the due date of the tax, whichever is later. 
(Ord. of 12-9-96, § C(f)) 
Sec. 78-115. - Gross receipts-Situs. 
(a)  General rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this article is measured by gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a licensable privilege at a definite place of business within this jurisdiction. In the case of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities are initiated, directed or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for different classifications of business shall be attributed to one or more definite places of business or offices as follows: 
(1)  The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which his services are performed, or if his services are not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3715. 
(2)  The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation activities are directed or controlled; however, a wholesaler or distribution house subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two or more localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different measures, may apply to the department of taxation for a determination as to the proper measure of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality. 
(3)  The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented from any definite place of business, then the definite place of business at which the rental of such property is managed. 
(4)  The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are performed or, if not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled. 
(b)  Apportionment. 
(1)  If the licensee has more than one definite place of business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed under the general rule, and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an apportionment agreement, except as to circumstances set forth in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3709, the gross receipts of the business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the basis of payroll. 
(2)  Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless some activities under the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from, such definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction shall not be attributed to this jurisdiction solely because the other jurisdiction does not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction. 
(c)  Agreements. The assessor may enter into agreements with any other political subdivision of the state concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business. However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one or more political subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has, or is likely to, result in taxes on more than 100 percent of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the assessor shall make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions involved. 
(Ord. of 12-9-96, § D) 
Sec. 78-116. - Same-Exclusions and deductions. 
(a)  Gross receipts for license tax purposes shall not include any amount not derived from the exercise of the licensed privilege to engage in a business or profession in the ordinary course of business or profession. 
(b)  The following items shall be excluded from gross receipts: 
(1)  Amounts received and paid to the United States, the state or any county, city or town for the state retail sales or use tax, or for any local sales tax or any local excise tax on cigarettes, for any federal or state excise taxes on motor fuels. 
(2)  Any amount representing the liquidation of a debt or conversion of another asset to the extent that the amount is attributable to a transaction previously taxed (e.g., the factoring of accounts receivable created by sales that have been included in taxable receipts even though the creation of such debt and factoring are a regular part of its business). 
(3)  Any amount representing returns and allowances granted by the business to its customer. 
(4)  Receipts which are the proceeds of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the obligor. 
(5)  Receipts representing the return of principal of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the creditor, or the return of principal or basis upon the sale of a capital asset. 
(6)  Rebates and discounts taken or received on account of purchases by the licensee. A rebate or other incentive offered to induce the recipient to purchase certain goods or services from a person other than the offeror, and which the recipient assigns to the licensee in consideration of the sale of goods and services shall not be considered a rebate or discount to the licensee, but shall be included in the licensee's gross receipts together with any handling or other fees related to the incentive. 
(7)  Withdrawals from inventory for purposes other than sale or distribution and for which no consideration is received and the occasional sale or exchange of assets other than inventory, whether or not a gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. 
(8)  Investment income not directly related to the privilege exercised by a licensable business not classified as rendering financial services. This exclusion shall apply to interest on bank accounts of the business, and to interest, dividends and other income derived from the investment of its own funds in securities and other types of investments unrelated to the licensed privilege. This exclusion shall not apply to interest, late fees and similar income attributable to an installment sale or other transaction that occurred in the regular course of business. 
(c)  The following shall be deducted from gross receipts or gross purchases that would otherwise be taxable: 
(1)  Any amount paid for computer hardware and software that are sold to a United States federal or state government entity provided that such property was purchased within two years of the sale to the entity by the original purchaser who shall have been contractually obligated at the time of purchase to resell such property to a state or federal government entity. This deduction shall not occur until the time of resale and shall apply to only the original cost of the property and not to its resale price, and the deduction shall not apply to any of the tangible personal property which was the subject of the original resale contract if it is not resold to a state or federal government entity in accordance with the original contract obligation. 
(2)  Any receipts attributable to business conducted in another state or foreign country in which the taxpayer is liable for an income tax or other tax based upon income. 
(Ord. of 12-9-96, § H) 
Sec. 78-117. - Limitations and extensions. 
(a)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed pursuant to this article, both the assessing official and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
(b)  Notwithstanding Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3903, the assessing official shall assess the local license tax omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a license for the current license year and the six preceding years. 
(c)  The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior to the period specified in Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3940, two years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to this subsection, two years after the final determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed pursuant to section 78-118(b) or (d), or two years after the final decision in a court application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984, or similar law for which collection has been stayed, whichever is later. 
(Ord. of 12-9-96, § E) 
Sec. 78-118. - Appeals and rulings. 
(a)  Any person assessed with a licensing tax under this article as the result of an audit may apply within 90 days from the date of the assessment to the assessing official for a correction of the assessment. The application must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, audit period, remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The assessor may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and documents, further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of the applications. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. The assessor shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a determination to the taxpayer setting forth its position. Every assessment pursuant to an audit shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to seek correction and the specific procedure to be followed in the jurisdiction (e.g., the name and address to which an application should be directed). 
(b)  Provided an application is made within 90 days of an assessment, collection activity shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the assessor, unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 78-114, but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" includes a finding that the application is frivolous, or that a taxpayer desires to depart quickly from the locality, to remove his property therefrom, to conceal himself or his property therein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to collect the tax for the period in question. 
(c)  Any person assessed with a license tax under this article as a result of an audit may apply within 90 days of the determination by the assessing official on an application pursuant to subsection (a) of this section to the tax commissioner for a correction of such assessment. The tax commissioner shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within 90 days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and the assessing official are notified that a longer period will be required. The application shall be treated as an application pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1821, and the tax commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-1822. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the assessing official may apply to the appropriate circuit court pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 58.1-3984. However, the burden shall be on the party making the application to show that the ruling of the tax commissioner is erroneous. Neither the tax commissioner nor the department of taxation shall be made a party to an application to correct an assessment merely because the tax commissioner has ruled on it. 
(d)  On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the tax commissioner under subsection (c) of this section, the assessing official shall further suspend collection activity until a final determination is issued by the tax commissioner unless the assessor determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 78-114, but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection (b) of this section.

In the event that the official zoning district map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the town council may by ordinance adopt a new official zoning district map. The new official zoning district map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning district map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning district map or any subsequent amendments thereof. 
(f)  Attesting. The official zoning district map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the town clerk, and bear the following words: 
"This is to certify that this Official Zoning District Map was adopted on the 11th day of December as part of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of South Hill, Virginia." Unless the prior Official Zoning District Map has been lost, or totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. * 
* Refer to section 94.1-45 for use of existing zoning district map as the interim zoning map. 
(g)  Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the official zoning district map, the following rules apply: 
(1)  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets or highways, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines or extension of such lines, such center lines, street lines or highway right-of-way lines or extension of such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
(2)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets, or the center lines and right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the official zoning district map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the official zoning district map. 
(3)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they appear to follow lot lines or extension of lot lines, such lot lines or extension of lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries, and the location of any lot line used as a district boundary shall be the location in existence as of the date of the ordinance establishing such boundary. 
(4)  Where a district boundary is indicated to follow a river, creek, branch, or other body of water, said boundary shall be construed to follow the center line at low water or at the limit of the jurisdiction, and in the event of change in the shoreline such boundary shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline. 
(5)  Where a discrepancy or uncertainty exists between a district boundary shown on the official zoning district map and that which is described in the text of the ordinance establishing such boundary, the text of the ordinance shall be the final authority. 
(6)  If no such distance, angle, curvature description or other means is given to determine a boundary line accurately and the foregoing provisions do not apply, the boundary line shall be a property line or extension of a property line determined by the use of scale shown of the official zoning district map. In case of subsequent dispute, the matter shall be referred to the board of zoning appeals, which shall determine the boundary in accordance with the provisions of article XVII.

Sec. 94.1-45. - Use of existing zoning district map as interim zoning district map. 
    For the purpose of facilitating the transition from the existing zoning district classifications to the zoning district classifications set out in this chapter, the zoning district map that is applicable at the time of adoption of this chapter shall continue to be used until modified by the town council. Any revisions to the zoning district map shall use both existing and new designations until a new zoning map using only the new designations has been prepared. The following table of substitutions will be used to translate the "old" zoning district names to the "new" zoning district names until such time when a new zoning district map using the zoning classifications established by this article has been prepared and adopted. For the purpose of this paragraph "old zoning district names" refer to the districts established by the previous chapter 94 of the town Code which derived from Sept. 14, 1973, as amended, and "new zoning district names" refer to the districts established by this chapter 94.1.

Sec. 94.1-46. - Regulations of areas under water. 
    All areas within the town and under water are considered to be within a zoning district and controlled by applicable district regulations. District boundaries over water areas are located by noted or scaled dimensions, by relation to physical features, by coincidence with town limits or by straight line projection of the district boundaries as indicated on the district maps. Straight line district boundaries over water areas shall be assumed to continue as straight lines until they intersect with each other or with the town limit line. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-47. - Purposes of primary zoning districts. 
(a)  R1-40 transitional suburban residential district. This zoning district is designed to provide a transitional area between the developed areas of the town and rural areas beyond the town limits and is intended to provide an area of the town in which urban-type development may expand as the need occurs. The district is established for the specific purpose of providing for the orderly expansion of urban development into territory surrounding presently urbanized areas within the town, confining such development to locations that can feasibly be supplied with urban type facilities and discourage random scattering of development within these areas. 
    The predominant land uses of the area are intended to be a mixture of: (a) low-density residential uses; (b) uses that are customarily considered to be compatible with residential areas; and (c) limited agricultural uses that existed as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives. Unless included as a specifically-permitted use in article IV, intensive production agriculture or agricultural operations as described in Code of Virginia, §§ 3.1-22.28 and 3.1-22.29, that involve commercial animal raising operations are not considered to be appropriate for this district. 
(b)  R-15 single-family residential district. This district is designed to recognize existing areas that are developed or are suitable for development predominantly with residential uses at a density up to about 21/2 single-family lots per acre. The intent of the district is to stabilize and protect the basic characteristics and amenities of residential development and to promote and encourage the establishment and maintenance of a suitable environment for family life. To these ends development is limited to low-to-medium density single-family dwellings and certain compatible public and quasi-public services and facilities customarily considered supportive to residential development. 
(c)  R-10 single-family residential district. This district is designed to recognize areas that are developed or are suitable for development predominantly with residential uses at an average density of about 31/2 single-family lots per acre. The intent of the district is to stabilize and protect the basic characteristics and amenities of residential development and to promote and encourage the establishment and maintenance of a suitable environment for family life. To these ends development is limited to low-to-medium density dwellings and certain compatible public and quasi-public services and facilities customarily considered supportive to residential development. 
(d)  R1-6 single-family residential district. This district is designed to recognize areas that are developed or are suitable for development predominantly with residential uses at an average density of about six single-family lots per acre. The intent of the district is to stabilize and protect the basic characteristics and amenities of residential development and to promote and encourage the establishment and maintenance of a suitable environment for family life. To these ends, development is limited to medium density dwellings and certain compatible public and quasi-public services and facilities customarily considered supportive to residential development. 
(e)  R2-8 moderate density residential district. This district is designed to provide for the development of residential areas with densities up to about eight dwellings per acre. Typical uses may include two-family, townhouses and similar attached single-family dwellings established on separate lots. The district also recognizes existing residential areas that have been previously established with the same characteristics and density of development. To these ends development is limited to dwellings of moderate density and certain compatible public or quasi-public facilities that are supportive of and compatible with residential development. 
(f)  R2-16 general residential district. This district is designed to recognize existing areas that are developed or are suitable for development with multiple-family dwellings with moderate to high densities up to 16 dwellings per acre. The intent of the district is to enable the market place to provide housing opportunities for a wide range of life styles and income needs and to do so in locations that are compatible with surrounding development and the overall development goals of the town. Typical uses may include apartment projects and other residential building types or styles intended for permanent occupancy as residences.* To these ends development is limited to multiple-family dwellings of moderate-to-high density and certain compatible public, quasi-public and/or limited retail facilities that are supportive of and compatible with existing residential development. 
* May include what is called "assisted living" facilities. 
(g)  O-M office and medical district. This district is designed to recognize existing areas that are developed or are suitable for development with professional, medical or commercial offices. The intent of the district is to provide appropriate areas for the establishment of professional or other business offices in locations that are compatible with surrounding development and the overall development goals of the town. Typical uses include buildings whose uses are primarily to provide offices for the practice of medicine, engineering, architecture, and like professions or for business offices, such as insurance or real estate offices which provide no sale of goods nor offer any other commercial activity or services on the same site. Limited retail sales may be included within offices provided that the activity is a minor auxiliary function customarily associated with the practice of a profession.* Medical facilities such as clinics, day surgery centers, medical laboratories that are compatible with other uses in the district may be permitted but may require special approval as a special exception permit. 
* Such as sale of eye glasses as an adjunct to an opthomologist's office, or an ethical pharmacy within a building where several physicians practice. 
(h)  C-1 neighborhood commercial district. This district is designed to provide for the establishment of or continuance of small business areas that will serve the surrounding residential neighborhood with convenience goods. Since traffic and parking congestion must be held to a minimum within and near residential areas to protect property values and preserve amenities of residential areas, all neighborhood business development shall take place in a limited business district. A desirable size for such an area is five stores and should include only such activities that are necessary for the day-to-day operation of a normal household. 
(i)  C-2 general commercial district. This district is designed to provide commercial sites for a wide variety of retail, service and general business uses along major thoroughfares in order to serve local and transient shoppers. The use priorities for the C-2 district include retail establishments, shopping centers, convenience stores, fast-food and other restaurants, motels, gasoline stations, and the like. Except for the central business district, this district provides the primary business area for the town and its trade area. 
(j)  C-3 central business district. This district is the traditional business center for the town and currently is the focal point of much of the town's retail business and general commercial activity. Major defining characteristics of the area include: traffic congestion; parking shortages; aging buildings and absence of open land area. The purpose of this zoning district is to recognize these characteristics and provide zoning regulations that are consistent with the physical conditions and land uses within this area. Unique features of this zoning district are that minimum restrictions apply to setback, building height and bulk, and parking. Reuse of older buildings for uses appropriate to the central business district are encouraged. 
(k)  MX-3 urban mixed use district. This district is designed to recognize areas that are planned for urban development. Like the downtown area, it anticipates buildings built close to the street in a walkable environment. The district provides substantial flexibility on use, allowing residential, commercial and office uses together in the same building (vertical mixed use) or near each other (horizontal mixed use). It is intended to provide for nodes of development that serve surrounding residential neighborhoods with convenience retail and employment opportunities. 
(l)  I-P industrial park district. This district provides specific areas for certain nonoffensive industries, warehousing, wholesale distribution facilities, research and development facilities, light manufacturing and office complexes which do not have harmful effects on other areas of the town. The district applies only to land located in an industrial park owned by the town or other political subdivision of the state. In addition to regulations contained in this chapter, the use of land or buildings within the I-P district are also affected by covenants and other restrictions associated with deeds, leases or other documents executed between the town and the purchaser or lessee. 
(m)  I-G industrial district, general. This district provides appropriate locations for certain nonoffensive industrial and manufacturing uses which, while providing employment opportunities and economic potential for the community, the operation of which imposes minimal hazards on the community. Compatibility with other development within the town is promoted by the use of greater setbacks and yards, buffering from residential areas and approvals by the town council as a special exceptions for many industrial or manufacturing uses.* 
* For uses that are questionable as to their suitability for the town, this district would require approval through special exception permits or amendments to the permitted uses in article IV. The application for such permit requires supporting analysis to demonstrate that the intended use is compatible with the development objectives of the town. 
NOTE: The purposes of special purpose zoning districts are given in the articles that deal specifically with the regulations of each district.

Sec. 94.1-73. - Use and interpretation of table of permitted uses. 
    Table 4.1, titled "Uses Permitted by Zoning District", lists specific uses permitted within the town in each of the primary zoning districts listed in article III and in the previous section. Although the special purpose zoning districts are listed above for completeness, each special district has its own special requirements and for this reason regulations for these districts are set out in separate articles of this chapter. 
    All uses that are permitted within the town are listed alphabetically in the first column of this table. Each column after that represents one primary zoning district and each row represents one specific use. Within the columns, various codes identify the zoning district(s) in which each use is permitted. A use is shown in one of the following ways: to be permitted by right; or to be permitted as a special exception use according to the following: 
(1)  Use permitted by right. This type of use is one that is permitted in a zoning district and for which a permit may be approved by the zoning administrator after an applicant meets the requirements of the district regulations in which the use is to be located and other applicable town codes and ordinances. The abbreviation used in the table to indicate a use permitted by right is the letter "R". When that abbreviation is used in the table, it indicates that the corresponding use is permitted by right in the district, or districts, indicated at the top of the column. 
(2)  Use permitted by special exception permit. This type of use is one that, while permitted in a district, each specific occurrence must be approved as a legislative action by the town council after review by the planning commission with the same notices and hearings that are required for zoning changes. The abbreviation used to indicate a conditional use in the table is the letter "S". 
(3)  Interpretation of Table 4.1. 
a.  If a use is not specifically listed in the table then that use may not be established within the town. 
b.  A use may, however, be implied through a listing of a category which contains a family of uses although the use itself may not be specifically listed as a separate use. In such case, the use may be permitted in a district only if it can be clearly demonstrated that the use is customarily accepted as being within the meaning of the category identified in the table. 
c.  If, however, a specific use is listed in the table as permitted in any district by right or by special exception, then that use may not be implied as belonging to a general category. In such case a specific use definition shall take precedence over a general category definition. 
d.  Regulations of an overlay zoning district which place limitations on, or modifies the requirements of a use or uses otherwise permitted in a primary zoning district, shall be considered to be in addition to the regulations of the primary zoning district in which such use or uses are located. 
e.  Special exception uses that require authorization by the town council are listed in Table 4.1. The following conditions apply to all special exception uses: 
1.  The use shall comply with all licensing requirements, if any, of any town, county, state or federal government or their agencies. 
2.  The use shall be operated in a way as to be compatible with other uses within the same vicinity and in no manner shall it become a nuisance to the neighborhood in which it is located. 
3.  In granting a special exception use, the town council shall consider the public convenience, necessity, and general welfare. 
4.  A special exception use permit shall be approved only when town council is satisfied that the use and the operation thereof will not be in conflict with the objectives of the comprehensive plan, will not adversely affect adjoining and surrounding property, will not unreasonably impair light and air, convenience of access or safety from fire, flood and other dangers, will not create or unreasonably increase congestion on adjacent streets, will not overburden utilities, public facilities or public services, will not encroach upon historic areas, and will not otherwise be contrary to the stated intent and purpose of this chapter or contrary to good zoning practices. 
5.  In evaluating and acting upon special exception use permit applications, the planning commission and the town council shall consider, among other factors: the adequacy of utilities, access, and necessary public facilities and services; off-street parking and vehicular circulation; the arrangement and relationship among elements of the site plan; and the adequacy of separation, buffers, yards and other features to protect adjacent properties from potential adverse effects of the conditional use. The planning commission may recommend and the town council may impose such reasonable requirements and conditions as deemed necessary to accomplish the intent and purpose of this chapter and to meet the guidelines set forth in this section. 
6.  Except to the extent that greater requirements may be imposed by the town council pursuant to the provisions of this section, a special exception use shall comply with the regulations and standards generally applicable within the district in which it is located and with any specific conditions for the particular use as set forth in the district regulations. 
7.  It is the intent of this chapter that, if required and upon application by the owner, a special exception permit shall be automatically issued administratively and without payment of any fees for any legally existing special exception use that was properly authorized by a previous zoning ordinance prior to the date of adoption of this chapter. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-74. - Accessory uses. 
    Accessory uses that are customarily associated with and are essential to the use and operation of a primary use are considered as part of the primary use and, unless otherwise prohibited by some specific provision of this chapter, such accessory uses shall be permitted to be installed and used along with the primary use which they serve. No accessory use may be established or operated except as an adjunct to its primary use. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-75. - Uses not permitted within the town. 
    The following uses shall not be established within any zoning district within the town limits: 
(1)  Junkyard, including automobile graveyard as defined in chapter 99.1. 
(2)  A facility, also known as a slaughter house or abattoir, where livestock is killed and prepared for distribution to retail markets or other processing. 
(3)  A facility processing medical or other hazardous wastes. 
(4)  Construction/demolition/debris landfills. 
(5)  Dumps.

ARTICLE V. - SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 94.1-100. - Purpose of article. 
    This article establishes minimum site development regulations and other special requirements for each of the primary zoning districts. Unless modified by other provisions of this article or this chapter, the dimensional regulations given in this article are the minimum requirements for lot area, width, frontage, and yards of all land uses established in the town after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives or any subsequent amendment thereto. In addition this article establishes the maximum building height to which buildings may be erected and/or the bulk thereof. Site development regulations of this article along with applicable supplementary regulations expressed elsewhere in this chapter are cumulative and in case of conflict the greater requirement shall control. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-101. - Minimum lot dimension and area or density requirements for residential uses. 
    The minimum lot area, required frontage along public streets and width at the building line of residential lots are set out in Table 5.1 below. 
(1)  Usable lot area. In all cases where a minimum lot area is required for residential uses, not more than 15 percent of such required lot area shall be land that is unusable as a result of severe physical or environmental conditions. For this requirement, unusable land includes any land with slopes of 20 percent or greater, land in a designated floodplain, or any other area that has been determined to be environmentally sensitive. 
(2)  Minimum lot area for residential uses not served by public water and sewerage systems. 
a.  For lots containing or intended to contain a single-family dwelling not served by public water and sewerage systems, the minimum lot area shall be not less than 20,000 square feet. The required area for any such use shall be approved by the health official. The zoning administrator may require a greater area if considered necessary by the health official. 
b.  For lots containing or intended to contain a single-family dwelling when served by public water and not served by public sewers, the minimum lot area shall be not less than 15,000 square feet. 
c.  This subsection shall not be construed to permit a smaller lot size than otherwise required in the zoning district in which the residential use is located.

ARTICLE VI. - MODIFICATIONS TO YARD AND BULK REGULATIONS AND OTHER SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 94.1-120. - Purpose of article. 
    The purpose of this article is to modify, extend, supplement, clarify and/or qualify in specific cases the zoning district regulations which appear elsewhere in this chapter. Provisions given in this article shall apply to the specific conditions enumerated herein and shall supersede general regulations for the zoning districts. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-121. - General modifications to yard regulations. 
(a)  Use of yards, generally. When yards are required in a district, every part of a required yard shall be unobstructed by a building, structure or use, except for: 
(1)  Off-street parking. Parking spaces are permitted in a front, side or rear yard, provided that no parking space shall be located within a triangle composed of two 20-foot legs of intersecting streets. 
(2)  Building projections. Sills, belt courses, eaves, normal roof overhangs, chimneys, pilasters and similar architectural features of a building may project into required yards. 
(3)  Porches. An open, unenclosed porch may project into the required front yard for a distance not exceeding five feet. 
(4)  Chimneys. Chimneys or fireplaces may project into required yards up to two feet. 
(5)  Fire escapes. Open or lattice enclosed fire escapes may project up to five feet into a required yard but may occupy no more than one-half the width of a required side yard. 
(6)  Attached structures. An unenclosed carport, porch or stoop that is attached to a dwelling, may extend into a required side yard a distance of not more than one-third of the width of the required side yard. 
(7)  Interpretation of encroachment. For purposes of determining whether a main building violates a required yard or setback requirement, if the outermost surface of the foundation wall of a main building protrudes no more than six inches into such yard or setback, the building shall be considered as meeting the yard/setback requirements. 
(b)  Yards for multiple buildings on same lot. 
(1)  Commercial or industrial. Where a lot is used for a commercial or industrial purpose, more than one main building may be located upon the lot but only when each separate building is provided with open space equivalent to the yard requirements of the district in which the lot is located. 
(2)  Multiple residential buildings. Where a lot is to be used for multi-family residential or institutional purposes, more than one main building may be located on the lot, but only when there is provided between buildings that are parallel, or within 45 degrees of being parallel, a minimum of 20 feet for one-story buildings, 30 feet for two-story buildings, and 40 feet for three-story buildings. No dimension between any two buildings shall be less than 15 feet. When such buildings are of varying height, the buildings with the greater height shall be used for application of height regulations. 
(c)  Walls and fences. 
(1)  Side and rear yards. In all residential districts, fences and walls not exceeding six feet in height may be erected in a rear or side yard. In commercial or industrial districts, fences and walls may be erected up to 12 feet in height unless otherwise approved by the building official. 
(2)  Retaining walls. Yard requirements shall not apply to any retaining wall erected in conformity with other applicable ordinances. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00; Ord. of 6-8-02) 
Sec. 94.1-122. - Modifications to front yard regulations. 
(a)  Front yards in partially built-up block. The following adjustments may be made in blocks that are partially built-up. 
(1)  Forty percent or more developed. Where 40 percent or more of the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings, the average setback of existing buildings shall be used to establish the front yard for other buildings erected within the same block. This rule shall not be applied, however, to require that a new building be positioned on a lot so that its rear line is closer to the street than the front line of an existing building on an adjacent lot. 
(2)  Recorded setback line. Where a legally-recorded subdivision plat that was recorded prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives establishes a building setback, such setback line may be used in lieu of the setback or front yard otherwise established by this chapter. 
(3)  Less than 40 percent developed. Where less than 40 percent of the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting streets is developed, and no setback line is established in a legally-recorded subdivision plat, the front yard requirements established by this chapter shall apply. 
(b)  Projections into front yards. 
(1)  An enclosed vestibule or bay window containing not more than 40 square feet of floor space may project into the required front yard for a distance not exceeding four feet. 
(2)  Awnings may project into the required front yard for a distance not exceeding three feet. 
(c)  Other front yard adjustments. 
(1)  Corner lot. The required front yard on a corner lot shall be observed on the frontage having the lesser dimension; the other frontage shall be considered a side yard (see separate rule for side yards). The minimum side yard on the side facing the side street shall be 25 feet or more for both main and accessory buildings. 
(2)  Double frontage lots. In case a lot extends through a block from street to street and where a front yard is required from such streets, front yards shall be provided along each street frontage. 
(3)  Minimum lot depth preserved. The front yard regulations of this chapter shall not be applied to reduce the distance between the front building line and the rear of a lot to less than 80 feet. 
(4)  Signs and poles. When permitted in a district, signs or poles, except "advertising signs", may be erected in a required front yard. 
(5)  Motor fuel pump islands. Motor fuel pumps and pump islands, including accompanying unenclosed canopies, may be located within a front yard in a district that permits motor fuel service stations as an accessory or subordinate use to such motor fuel service station or to a retail convenience store; provided they are located not less than 25 feet from the street right-of-way line; and provided further, that in no district shall these accessory uses be located less than 50 feet from the boundary line of any dwelling district. 
(d)  Permitted adjustments of lot frontages on certain roads. Every lot established hereafter and used for single-family residential development shall have a frontage on an approved road as required in the district regulations provided that: (i) in cases where a lot fronts on the outside right-of-way (the right-of-way with the longest dimension) of a curved road and is arranged radially to the road's curvature, the lot frontage may be reduced to not less than 75 percent of the required frontage provided the lot width at the building line is not less than the required frontage; and (ii) where a lot fronts on the turn-around of a cul-de-sac, the frontage may be reduced to 50 percent of the width required at the front building setback line providing the width at the building setback line is not less than 80 percent of the required lot frontage. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-123. - Modifications to side yard regulations. 
    The side yard regulations shall be adjusted in applicable cases in conformity with the modifications set forth as follows: 
(1)  Side yards to multiple dwellings. For the purpose of the side yard regulations, a building containing multiple uses such as a two-family dwelling, townhouse cluster, or a multiple-dwelling shall provide the same side yard as any other single building occupying one lot. 
(2)  Dwelling above commercial. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter by a specific regulation, where dwellings are permitted to be erected above an existing predominantly commercial establishment, the required side yard shall be the same as required for the commercial buildings. 
(3)  Commercial in predominantly residential building. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter by a specific regulation and where commercial uses are erected in the same building, the side yard requirements for dwellings in the district in which the use is located shall apply to both residential and commercial uses. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-124. - Modification to height and bulk regulations. 
    The height and bulk regulations shall be adjusted in applicable cases in conformity with the modifications set forth as follows: 
(1)  Building height. A building may be erected to any height provided that required front, side and rear yards shall be increased one foot for each three feet of height over 35 feet. 
(2)  Chimneys, steeples, towers. The height regulations set forth in this chapter shall not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennae attached to buildings, water tanks, windmills, ventilators, chimneys or similar appurtenances attached to the roof of a building and not intended for human occupancy, provided that the height of such appurtenances shall not constitute a hazard to the safe operation of aircraft. The height of freestanding antennae in any district shall be no greater than the distance from the base of the antenna to the nearest property line. 
(3)  Radio, microwave, television and cellular telephone towers. In all commercial, industrial, or commercial districts where permitted, radio and television towers may be erected to a height not exceeding 150 feet. In all residential districts, such towers shall not exceed 25 feet above the highest point of the nearest building and shall be limited to noncommercial use. 
(4)  Accessory buildings. Accessory buildings may be constructed in a rear or side yard in conformity with the following regulations: 
a.  No accessory building shall be more than one story in height which is within 20 feet of an adjoining property line. All accessory buildings shall be less than the main building in height. 
b.  Accessory buildings located closer than ten feet to a main building shall be construed to be a part of the main building for the purposes of yard regulations and such buildings, whether connected to the main building or not, shall observe all front, side and rear yard regulations applicable to main buildings. 
c.  No accessory building shall be used for dwelling purposes. 
d.  In all residential districts except the R2-16 general dwelling district, an accessory building may be built in the rear yard provided it is not closer than ten feet to any side or rear lot line. Within the R2-16 general dwelling district an accessory building may be erected within five feet of a side or rear property line. In no case shall an accessory building occupy more than 30 percent of the rear yard. 
e.  Within all residential zoning districts an accessory building may be built in a rear yard provided that: (a) it shall not occupy more than 30 percent of a rear yard; and (b) it shall not be closer than ten feet to any side or rear lot line. 
(5)  Open space partially surrounded by buildings. Where an open space is more than 50 percent surrounded by a building, the minimum width of the open space shall be at least 20 feet for one-story buildings, 30 feet for two-story buildings and 40 feet for three-story buildings. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-125. - Special requirements for double-wide multiunit manufactured homes placed on lots. 
    The installation of double-wide or multiunit manufactured housing must comply with the following:

ARTICLE IX. - REGULATIONS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD CONSERVATION DISTRICT 

Sec. 94.1-200. - Purpose of article. 
    The town council recognizes: (a) that many older buildings within the town were originally designed and used as single-family homes; (b) that some of the more architecturally significant of these buildings are located along a few major thoroughfares; and (c) that many of these buildings may serve a better purpose if limited modifications are allowed to their existing residential use. Accordingly, the neighborhood conservation district (NCD) is intended to promote and encourage the preservation of such structures by permitting limited modifications of their use provided that, after modification, their existing exterior architectural qualities are maintained and the residential qualities of the neighborhood in which they are located are not impaired. The focus of the regulations of the NCD will be on preserving buildings that were originally built and used as single-family dwellings but which because of their location, changed conditions and economics, they are experiencing pressures to be converted to other uses. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-201. - Establishment of district. 
    The neighborhood conservation district, which is to be known by its short title of "NCD," is hereby established as an overlay zoning district within the zoning ordinance of the town.

ARTICLE X. - SITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 94.1-230. - Purpose of article. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote the orderly development of land within the town by ensuring: (a) that land development occurs consistent with the comprehensive plan and development policies of the town; (b) that specific development projects are compatible with the surrounding environment; (c) that each project is planned with adequate circulation and infrastructure; and (d) that development and use of land gives high priority to preserving the community's valuable natural resources. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-231. - Site plan required. 
    The requirements for site plan submissions and reviews are grouped into three levels according to the complexity of the project, the procedures involved and the actions necessary for approval. The review requirements established in this article do not exempt an applicant from complying with other requirements of this chapter or other town ordinances. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, a site plan shall be submitted and approved by one of the types of reviews described below according to the class or type of project proposed by the plan. 
(1)  Level one, administrative review. Site plans for the following classes of projects may be reviewed and approved by the zoning administrator upon finding that the plans are in conformity with applicable regulations. 
a.  Single-family dwelling. Single-family dwellings are exempt from the site plan requirements unless (a) a variance is required by the board of zoning appeals to alleviate an undue hardship related to conditions on the property or (b) a special exception use or conditional zoning is required to be approved by the town council. 
b.  Small nonresidential projects. A nonresidential building or structure that has a gross floor area of not more than 1,000 square feet, involves disturbing not more than 2,500 square feet of land and requires no additional curb cuts for access to a public street. 
(2)  Level two, review by site plan committee. This level involves the site plans for any project that requires neither changes in the zoning, nor special exception permit but the proposed development involves multiple uses and/or complex issues that are best addressed by technical review. 
A site plan committee is hereby authorized to be established whose members shall be appointed by the town manager. The purpose of the site plan committee is to serve in a technical advisory role to the zoning administrator in the administration of this article. The members of such committee shall consist of representatives of departments responsible for management and operation of facilities. The zoning administrator shall serve as the committee's secretary. 
The site plan committee shall review site plans in the following cases and recommend to the zoning administrator whether a project should be approved as submitted, approved with changes, or disapproved. The zoning administrator is authorized to make final approval of projects of this type after taking into consideration the recommendations of the site plan committee. Projects included in this class are: 
a.  Residential projects involving multiple-family dwellings, townhouses or duplexes. 
b.  Commercial uses with buildings having a gross floor area of more than 1,000 square feet, requiring the disturbance of more than 2,500 square feet of land, or requiring additional curb cuts for access to a public street. 
c.  Industrial or manufacturing projects. 
d.  Institutional projects such as governmental use, church, club or medical facility. 
e.  Any project that involves multiple buildings. 
f.  Any project that requires a new curb cut for street access. 
g.  Construction in a floodzone. Any structure or use, including uses otherwise exempted, proposed to be constructed in the 100-year flood zone as established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(3)  Level three, review by planning commission and town council. Applications for changes in zoning or special exception uses require approval by the town council. Because these actions result in policy changes, they require public hearings with notice as required by the state code reports as well as recommendations from the planning commission. The zoning administrator may require that a plan of development be submitted with an application for a change in zoning or a special use permit showing the owner's proposal for developing the property. Following approval of a zoning change or special exception use by the town council, a site plan based on an approved plan of development shall be submitted for review to the zoning administrator, and in appropriate cases, the site plan committee. The following uses are subject to this level of review: 
a.  Planned unit development. 
b.  Manufactured home park. 
c.  Special exception uses. 
d.  Any use involving conditional zoning with proffered conditions. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-232. - Preapplication conference. 
    Unless a site plan is based on, or included in, a plan of development approved as part of an action by the town council, the applicant should schedule a preapplication conference with the zoning administrator for the purpose of discussing the proposed development. At this time the applicant may present a preliminary sketch in order to permit the zoning administrator to advise the applicant whether the proposed plan is, in general, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and other development ordinances of the town. Upon submission of the preliminary sketch, the zoning administrator shall study it and advise the applicant wherein changes, if any, should be made in order to comply with the regulations. If the proposed development requires review by the site plan committee, planning commission or town council, the zoning administrator shall so advise the applicant of the procedures to be followed and documentation to be submitted. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-233. - Site plan submission. 
    After the preapplication conference with the zoning administrator, an applicant may submit an application for site plan approval using one of the three procedures outlined in Table 10.1. Data to be included with a preliminary site plan or a final site plan may be waived by the zoning administrator for small projects when in the administrator's opinion such data are not relevant to the evaluation of the project.

--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- An ordinance adopted Aug. 9, 2004, amended Art. XII, §§ 94.1-280-94.1-299, in its entirety and reenacted a new Art. XII to read as set out herein. Former Art. XII, §§ 94.1-280-94.1-299, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 12-11-00; Ord. of 12-9-02(2) and Ord. of 6-9-03(4). 

Secs. 94.1-280-94.1-289. - Reserved. 
Sec. 94.1-290. - Statement of intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare of the people of the town by regulating existing and proposed outdoor signs of all types. Such regulation is intended to protect property values, create a more attractive economic and business climate, enhance the physical appearance of the town, and preserve the scenic and natural beauty of certain areas. It is further intended to reduce sign or advertising distraction and obstruction that may contribute to traffic accidents, reduce hazards that may be caused by signs overhanging or projecting over public rights-of-way, provide more open space, and curb the deterioration of the natural environment and enhance community development. 
(Ord. of 8-9-04) 
Sec. 94.1-291. - Scope of regulations. 
    These regulations shall apply to all districts within the corporate limits of the town. No sign for which a permit is required by this chapter shall be hung, erected, or placed without a sign permit having been issued by the building official appointed by the governing body to issue sign permits. 
    It is accepted that signs constitute a separate and distinct use of the land upon which they are erected and a use of the visible portion of adjacent public streets, sidewalks and other public places and private places open to the public. Therefore, it is further intended that this article: 
(1)  Place such limitations on the display of all signs that will assure that they will be appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant, and be adequate, but not excessive, for lawfully permitted purposes. 
(2)  Prohibit the erection of signs in such numbers, sizes and locations so as to create danger to the public by obscuring road signs, warning signs, lawfully required notices, and other signs essential to the safety and convenience of the public. 
(3)  Prohibit signs which are likely to create unsafe conditions by diverting the attention of motorists from their driving for periods likely to result in accidents. 
(4)  Prohibit signs in such manners, sizes and locations as may depreciate the value of property and the value and effectiveness of signs erected by others. 
(5)  Avoid excessive competition among sign displays in their demand for public attention, maximize the ability of permitted signs to provide identification and direction and minimize the clutter and unsightliness to the public in general, and dangerous distractions to motorists, of excessive competing signs. 
(Ord. of 8-9-04) 
Sec. 94.1-292. - Administration. 
(a)  Authorization. No sign shall be erected or displayed without a current valid permit therefor having first been issued by the zoning administrator. Before issuing a permit for the erection or display of any sign, the zoning administrator shall certify on the permit that the sign meets the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Application for permit. A properly filled out and completed application for a sign permit shall be filed on the appropriate forms. 
(c)  Filing fee. A nonrefundable filing and administration fee as set forth in the building permit fee schedule shall accompany all sign permits and applications. More than one sign on one building or grouping of buildings may be included in one application provided that all such signs are applied for at one time. 
(d)  Revocation of permit. Should a sign not be erected within six months following the issuance of a sign permit, said permit shall be void.

ARTICLE XIII. - TELECOMMUNICATION ANTENNAS AND TOWERS 

Sec. 94.1-300. - Purpose and intent of article. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article are to: (i) encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers and tower sites throughout the town, (ii) encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites, (iii) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the town is minimal, (iv) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas and (v) to provide adequate sites for the provision of telecommunication services with minimal negative impact on the resources of the town. This article is intended to comply with all federal and state regulations. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-301. - Applicability. 
(a)  Special exception permit required. Before a permit may be issued for any telecommunications tower, such permit must be approved by the town council after review by the planning commission according to procedures for special exception permits set out in article XVI. The location of telecommunications towers and other structures governed by this article is subject to the uses permitted in each zoning district in article IV. 
(b)  District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at greater than, 50 feet in height. 
(c)  Amateur radio and receive-only antennas. This article shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is (1) under 50 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is (2) used exclusively for receiving only antennas for amateur radio station operation. 
(d)  Existing structures and towers. The placement of an antenna on or in an existing structure such as a building, sign, light pole, water tank, or other freestanding structure or existing tower or pole shall be permitted so long as the addition of said antenna shall not add more than 20 feet in height to said structure or tower and shall not require additional lighting pursuant to FAA or other applicable requirements. Such permitted use also may include the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna so long as such building or equipment is placed within the existing structure or property and is necessary for such use. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-302. - General guidelines and requirements. 
(a)  Principal or accessory use. For purposes of determining compliance with area requirements, antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. An existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of antennas or towers on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district regulations, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased area within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
(b)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the zoning administrator an inventory of its existing facilities that are either within the locality or within five miles of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and existing use and available capacity of each tower. The zoning administrator may share such information with other applicants applying for approvals or special use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the locality; provided however, that the zoning administrator shall not, by sharing such information, in any way represent or warrant that such information, in any way represents or warrants that such sites are available or suitable. 
(c)  Design and lighting. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers and the installation of all antennas governed by this article; provided however, that the town may waive any of these requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
(1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. Dish antennas will be of a neutral, nonreflective color with no logos. 
(2)  At a facility site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and surrounding structures. 
(3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(4)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the town may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
(5)  No advertising of any type may be placed on the tower or accompanying facility unless as part of retrofitting an existing sign structure. 
(6)  To permit co-location, the tower shall be designed and constructed to permit extensions to a maximum height of 19 feet. 
(7)  Towers shall be designed to collapse within the lot lines in case of structural failure. 
(d)  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. 
(e)  Building codes. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable federal, state and local building codes and regulations. 
(f)  Information required. Each applicant requesting a special use permit under this article shall submit a scaled plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping and adjacent uses. The town may require other information to be necessary to assess compliance with this article. Additionally, applicant shall provide actual photographs of the site that include a simulated photographic image of the proposed tower. The photograph with the simulated image shall include the foreground, the midground, and the background of the site. 
(1)  An engineering report, certifying that the proposed tower is compatible for co-location with a minimum of three users including the primary user, must be submitted by the applicant. This provision may be waived by a governing body in a particular case. 
(2)  The zoning administrator shall notify adjoining property owners by certified letter concerning the project 14 days prior to public hearings before the planning commission and town council. 
(3)  The applicant shall provide copies of its co-location policy. 
(4)  The applicant shall provide copies of propagation maps demonstrating that antennas and sites for possible co-locator antennas are no higher in elevation than necessary. 
(g)  Special factors considered in granting all use permits for new towers. The applicant shall obtain a special use permit from the town before erecting towers or antennas covered by this article. The town shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although the town may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the town concludes that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
(1)  Height of the proposed tower; 
(2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
(3)  Nature of the uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
(4)  Surrounding topography; 
(5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
(6)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
(7)  Proposed ingress and egress; 
(8)  Co-location policy; 
(9)  Language of the lease agreement dealing with co-location; 
(10)  Consistency with the comprehensive plan and the purposes to be served by zoning; 
(11)  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed below; and 
(12)  Proximity to commercial or private airports. 
(h)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new towers shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the town that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
(1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
(3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
(4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding the cost of new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
(6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render towers and structures unsuitable. 
(i)  Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; provided however, that the town may reduce the standard setback requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
(1)  The tower must be set back from any off-site residential structure no less than 400 feet. 
(2)  Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements for primary structures. 
(j)  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided however, that the town may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
(k)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a special exception permit is required; provided however, that the town may waive such requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
(1)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of the support buildings from adjacent property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the facilities. 
(2)  In locations in which town council finds that the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether. 
(3)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, the town council may determine the growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer. 
(4)  Existing trees within 200 feet of the tower shall not be removed except as may be authorized to permit construction of the tower and installation of access for vehicle utilities. This provision may be waived by the governing body in a particular case. 
(l)  Local government access. Owners of towers shall provide the town co-location opportunities as a community benefit to improve radio communication for town departments and emergency services, provided it does not conflict with the co-location requirement of this article. 
(m)  Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 24 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of each such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the town notifying the owner of such removal equipment requirement. Removal includes the removal of the tower, all tower and fence footers, underground cables and support buildings. The buildings may remain with owner's approval. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. 
(n)  Required yearly report. The owner of each such antenna or tower shall submit a report to the town once a year, no later than July 1. The report shall state the current user status of the tower. 
(o)  Review fees. Any out of pocket costs incurred for review by a licensed engineer of any of the above required information shall be paid by the applicant.

(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-351. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Continuation of an existing nonconforming use. 
(1)  If at the time of enactment of this chapter any lot or structure is legally utilized in a manner or for a purpose that does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, such use may be continued as provided in this article. 
(2)  If any change in title of possession or renewal of a lease of any such lot or structure occurs, the use existing may be continued. 
(3)  If any nonconforming use, structure or activity is discontinued for a period exceeding two years continually after the enactment of this chapter, it shall be deemed abandoned and any subsequent use shall conform to the requirements of this chapter. 
(4)  A nonconforming structure, lot or activity may be changed to a use that is more restrictive than the then existing use. Whenever a nonconforming structure, lot or activity has been changed to a more restrictive use, it may not be changed back to a more restrictive nonconforming use; however, the use may be changed to an even more limited nonconforming use. 
(5)  If an existing building that is located on a lot of record does not meet the required setback or yard requirements at the time of passage of this chapter, or amendment hereof, such building shall be considered to be "vested" under this article. 
(b)  Permits. The construction or use of a nonconforming building or land area for which a permit was issued legally prior to the adoption of this chapter may proceed, provided such building is completed within one year of the date of the permit, or such use of land established within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives. 
(c)  Repairs and maintenance. On any building, devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement value of the structure provided that the cubic content of the structure as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter shall not be increased. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
(d)  Changes in district boundaries. Whenever the boundaries of a district are changed, any uses of land or buildings which become nonconforming as a result of such change shall become subject to the provisions of this article. 
(e)  Expansion or enlargement. 
(1)  A nonconforming structure to be extended or enlarged shall conform with the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  A nonconforming activity may be extended throughout any part of a structure that was arranged or designed for such activity at the time of enactment of this chapter. 
(f)  Nonconforming lots. Any lot of record at the time of the adoption of this chapter that is less in area or width than the minimum required by this chapter may be used subject to conditions of a variance to the required setbacks, sides and rear yards as may be approved by the board of zoning appeals. 
(g)  Restoration or replacement. 
(1)  If a nonconforming activity or structure is destroyed or damaged in any manner to the extent that the cost of restoring it to its condition before the occurrence shall be more than half the cost of replacing the entire structure, it shall not be restored unless it complies with the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  If a nonconforming activity or structure is destroyed or damaged in any manner to the extent that the cost of restoring it to its condition before the occurrence shall be less than half the cost of replacing the entire structure, it may be either repaired or restored, provided any such repair or restoration is started within 12 months and completed within 24 months from the date of partial destruction. 
(3)  The value of land or any factors other than the cost of the structure are excluded in the determination of cost of restoration for any structure or activity devoted to a nonconforming use.

(4)  Public hearings and advertisements. 
a.  The planning commission shall not recommend nor the town council approve any application for a change of zoning or a special exception permit until an opportunity has been provided at one or more public hearings for citizens to appear and present their views concerning the application. 
b.  Prior to holding any public hearing, notice of intention to do so ("notice") shall be given pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2204, as amended. In addition to the notice required by the Code of Virginia, it is the policy of the town that at the same time notice appears in the newspaper that the zoning administrator shall place on the property affected by the application a sign having dimensions of not less than 18 inches by 24 inches stating the following: 
"NOTICE THIS PROPERTY IS REQUESTED TO BE REZONED* FROM ____________ TO ____________ FOR INFORMATION CONTACT THE BUILDING OFFICIAL'S OFFICE TELEPHONE *** ****" 
* In the case of a special exception, use "A SPECIAL EXCEPTION IS REQUESTED TO PERMIT THE USE OF THIS PROPERTY FOR ____________ ."

c.  The town council and the planning commission may hold a joint public hearing after notice on any proposed amendment or special exception permit. 
(5)  Action by planning commission. 
a.  This chapter shall not be amended nor any special exception permit approved unless the town council has referred the proposal to the planning commission for its recommendation. For the convenience of the applicant and the purposes of this section, once a property owner's petition has been filed with the zoning administrator, and the administrator shall certify that all of the submission requirements for an amendment have been met, including the payment of fees, the application shall be considered to have been referred to the planning commission by the town council without the formality of a meeting. 
b.  Prior to making its recommendation, the planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing after notice has been given as required in this article. Following the planning commission's hearing, the commission shall submit its recommendations to the town council. In recommending the adoption of an amendment to this chapter or the approval of a special exception permit, the planning commission shall state its reasons for its recommendations, describing any recommended changes in conditions, if any. In addition, the commission should indicate whether the proposed amendment or special exception permit is in conformity with the comprehensive plan. 
c.  The recommendations of the planning commission shall be made to the town council not more than 90 days after the first meeting of the commission after the proposed amendment has been referred to the commission. Unless such proposed amendment or special exception permit has been withdrawn by the applicant, failure of the commission to report its recommendations prior to the expiration of the 90-day time period shall be considered to be a recommendation for approval. 
(6)  Action by the town council. The town council shall give notice and hold public hearing(s) on the application as required in this article, after which it may make appropriate changes or corrections in the proposed amendment or special exception permit. However, no additional land may be zoned to a more intensive use classification than was contained in the public notice without an additional public hearing and notice as required in this article. An affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of the town council shall be required to amend this chapter. 
Ordinances to amend the provisions of this chapter shall be enacted in the same manner as all other ordinances.

Such motion shall state the public purpose for the amendment, and shall be forwarded to the town council. 
(3)  Petition of property owner. A petition to change the zoning classification of property by amendment to the official zoning district map may be filed by the owner of the property or, with the written consent of the owner, the contract purchaser of the property or any agent of the owner. Such petition, addressed to the town council, shall be filed with the zoning administrator on forms provided by the zoning administrator. 
(c)  Procedures. An application to amend this chapter, including the official zoning district map, shall be submitted and processed in accordance with "submission of application" requirements set forth under general procedures in this article. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-373. - Amendments with conditions (conditional zoning). 
    The town council of the Town of South Hill, Virginia, hereby adopts the powers and authority conferred upon it by the General Assembly by Code of Virginia, §§ 15.2-2296 et seq., as amended. 
(1)  Definition of conditional zoning. "Conditional zoning" means, as part of classifying land within the town into areas and districts by legislative action, the allowing of reasonable conditions governing the use of such property, such conditions being in addition to, or modification of, the regulations provided for in the particular zoning district or zone or by the overall zoning ordinance. 
(2)  Purpose. It is the general policy of the town, in accordance with the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2283, to provide for the orderly development of land, for all purposes, through zoning and other land development legislation. Frequently where competing and incompatible uses conflict, traditional zoning methods and procedures are inadequate. In these cases, more flexible and adaptable zoning methods are needed to permit differing land uses and at the same time to recognize effects of change. It is the purpose of this article to provide a more flexible and adaptable zoning method to cope with the situations found in such zones through conditional zoning, whereby a zoning reclassification may be allowed subject to certain conditions proffered by the zoning applicant for the protection of the community that are not generally applicable to land similarly zoned. The provisions of this article shall not be used for the purpose of discrimination in housing. 
(3)  Proffer in writing. As a part of a petition for rezoning or amendment of the official zoning district map, the owner or owners of the property that is the subject of the petition may voluntarily proffer in writing, prior to the public hearing before the planning commission and/or town council, reasonable conditions in addition to the regulations provided for the zoning district or zone by other provisions of this chapter. Written proffers shall be submitted with the rezoning application and included with the advertisements for public hearing(s). Amendments may be made to the proffers during or following the planning commission's public hearing provided they are submitted prior to advertising the public hearing before the town council. The following limitations apply to proffered conditions: 
a.  The rezoning itself must give rise for the need for the conditions; 
b.  The conditions shall have a reasonable relation to the rezoning; 
c.  The conditions shall not include a cash contribution to the town; 
d.  The conditions shall not include mandatory dedication of real or personal property for open space, parks, schools, fire departments or other public facilities not otherwise provided for in subparagraph A(5) of Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2241; 
e.  The conditions shall not include payment for or construction of off-site improvements except those provided for in Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2241; 
f.  No condition shall be proffered that is not related to the physical development or physical operation of the property; and 
g.  All such conditions shall be in conformity with the town's comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2223 et seq. 
Proffered conditions shall be interpreted to include written statements, development plans, profiles, elevations and/or other demonstrative materials submitted as part of an application. 
Once proffered and accepted as part of an amendment to the zoning ordinance, such conditions shall continue in full force and effect regardless of changes in ownership or operation until a subsequent amendment changes the zoning on the property covered by such conditions; provided however, that such conditions shall continue if the subsequent amendment is part of a comprehensive implementation of a new or substantially revised zoning ordinance. 
(4)  Official zoning district map: conditional zoning index. The official zoning district map of the town shall show by an appropriate symbol on the map the existence of conditions attaching to the zoning depicted on the map. The zoning administrator shall keep in his office and make available for public inspection a conditional zoning index. The index shall provide ready access to the ordinance creating conditions in addition to the regulations provided for in a particular zoning district. 
(5)  Conformity of development plans. Any site plan, subdivision plat or development plan submitted for the development of the property in the town to which proffered conditions are applicable shall conform with all such proffered conditions, and no development shall be approved by any town official or otherwise permitted in the absence of such conformity. 
(6)  Amendment of conditions. There shall be no amendment or variation of any conditions created pursuant to this article until after a public hearing before the planning commission and town council with due notice pursuant to the provisions of Code of Virginia, § 15.2-2204. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00) 
Sec. 94.1-374. - Special exception permits. 
(a)  Purpose of special exception procedure. The purpose of the special exception procedure is to provide a means by which to authorize, after review and subject to appropriate conditions, certain specified uses which, although generally appropriate in the district in which they are specified, have a potentially greater impact on neighboring properties than those uses which are permitted by right in the district. The special exception procedure is intended to provide the opportunity for planning commission and town council review of each proposed use and its potential impacts on surrounding properties and land uses, given the particular circumstances of each case, and for the planning commission to recommend and the town council to attach such conditions as are necessary to ensure that the use will be compatible with the surrounding area and consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(b)  Special exception permit. A use or structure permitted as a special exception by the district regulations set forth in this chapter shall be authorized only upon approval of a special exception permit by the town council, and no building permit or certificate of occupancy for a special exception or a structure devoted to a special exception shall be issued unless and until a special exception permit for such has been approved in accordance with the provisions of this article and/or applicable provisions for special exceptions set out in article IV. 
(c)  Applications. Applications for special exception permits shall be submitted and processed in accordance with "submission of application" requirements set forth under general procedures in this article. 
(d)  Site plans to accompany applications. Special exception permit applications shall be accompanied by copies of a preliminary site plan as required by and prepared pursuant to requirements of article X. 
(e)  Amendments to special exception permits. Any amendment or change of substance in an approved permit shall be subject to the same procedures as are applicable to a new special exception permit application, provided that minor modifications to an approved site plan or building detail may be authorized by the zoning administrator when such modifications do not: significantly alter the boundaries of the property; conflict with specific requirements of this chapter or specific conditions of the approved special exception permit; decrease the width or depth of any yard, setback or buffer area; significantly alter points of access to the property or the internal arrangement of site plan elements; or have an appreciable effect on surrounding properties. 
(f)  Compliance with approved plans. Failure to comply with approved plans or conditions of a special exception permit shall constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter and shall be cause for revocation of the special exception permit by the zoning administrator. 
(g)  Automatic termination. The special exception for any use of structure authorized under the provisions of this section shall lapse and be of no effect if the structure is not constructed or use initiated within 18 months of the date of issuance of the permit. 
    If a business use authorized hereunder ceases to continue, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, for a period of 90 days or more, the special exception permit shall lapse and be of no effect. 
    Nothing contained herein shall prevent a new application from being filed for a special exception permit where a previous permit is terminated under the provisions hereof. 
(Ord. of 12-11-00; Ord. of 8-14-06) 
Sec. 94.1-375. - Joint processing of applications. 
    In cases where zoning applications, which are related to the same project, request amendments to the zoning map, amendments to the zoning text, application for a special exception permit or other approvals required to be made by the town council, it is the intent of the town to permit such applications to be submitted and processed simultaneously as if they were a single application. Notwithstanding that applications related to the same project may be processed jointly, in matters of advertising, conduct of public hearings, and voting by the planning commission and the town council, each application shall be considered separately.
