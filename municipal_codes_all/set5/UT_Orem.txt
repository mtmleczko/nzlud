this Section may be used. The City shall substantially comply with the following guidelines for the specific bid
process used:
A. Competitive Sealed Bidding.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 28
1. Description. Competitive sealed bidding is a procedure in which vendors or contractors are invited to
submit formal bids to provide a designated product or to complete a designated project in accordance
with specifications provided by the City
2. Appropriateness. Competitive sealed bidding is generally appropriate for all types of procurements. When
contractor quality is a prime concern in awarding a project bid, the City may pre-qualify bidders according
to a policy established by the City Manager.
3. Notice inviting bids issued. The City shall provide notice of its invitation for bids.
a. Notice includes a general description of the articles to be purchased or the work to be performed, the
location where bid blanks and specifications may be secured, and the time and place for opening bids.
b. The notice inviting bids shall be:
(i) Published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least ten (10) days before the date of
the opening of the bids or published with an outside sources entity whose purpose it is to facilitate
the advertisement and recruitment of competitive bidders at least ten (10) days before the date of
the opening of the bids.
(ii) Delivered to all known responsible prospective suppliers, including those whose names are on a
bidders' list or who have made a written request that their names be added to the bidders' list.
(III) Posted on a public bulletin board in the City Center Building and the City’s website at least ten (10)
days before the opening of the bids.
4. Bid procedure.
a. Sealed bids (or electronically submitted bids) shall be submitted as designated in the notice with the
statement "Bid for (item or project)" on the envelope (or in the electronic transmission).
b. Bids shall be opened (or read, in the case of electronically submitted bids) in public at the time and
place stated in the public notice.
c. Bids submitted to the City shall be evaluated on the basis of compliance with specifications and other
relevant criteria.
5. Bid Award. If the City elects to proceed with the purchase or project, bids shall be awarded to the lowest
responsive responsible bidder.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-07-0047, Amended 10/23/2007; Ord. No. O-2014-0030, Amended 08/26/2014)
B. Requests for Proposals.
1. Description. Requests for proposals (RFPs) are invitations for suppliers or contractors to submit a proposal
on a specific product or service. The City awards the contract for the product or service based on criteria
set forth in the request for proposals.
2. Appropriateness. RFPs may be used when required by law, or when the City Purchasing Agent determines,
in writing, that the RFP process will provide the best value to the City, or that the use of formal
competitive bidding is either impractical or not advantageous to the City. In making this determination,
the City Purchasing Agent shall consider factors such as:
a. whether there may be a need for price and service negotiation;
b. whether there may be a need for negotiation during performance of the contract;
c. whether the relative skills or expertise of the offerors will have to be evaluated;
d. whether cost is secondary to the characteristics of the product or service sought, as in a work of art;
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 29
e. whether the conditions of the service, product or delivery are unable to be sufficiently described in the
invitation for bids;
f. whether the City is requesting the offeror to propose a method or strategy for completing the project;
and
g. whether there may be a need to negotiate completion times related to the project.
If the City is requesting a price to complete an already designed project or to purchase a specific
product(s), it will generally be more appropriate to use the competitive sealed bids procedure rather than
the request for proposals procedure. Professional services will generally be procured through the request
for proposals procedure or as set forth in Section 2-7-6(A).
3. Notice.
a. Proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposals.
b. Public notice of the request for proposals shall be given. The time period to submit a response to a
request for proposal shall be no less than ten (10) days.
4. Request for proposals. The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other
evaluating factors.
5. Opening of proposals. Proposals shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of contents to competing
offerors during the process of negotiation. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to prohibit the City from
allowing or accepting electronically submitted proposals.
6. Revision of proposals.
a. As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who
submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose
of assuring full understanding of, and responsiveness to, solicitation requirements.
b. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and
revision of proposals, and revision may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the
purpose of obtaining best and final offers.
c. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals
submitted by competing offerors.
7. Award. Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be the most
advantageous to the City, taking into consideration price, the evaluation factors set forth in the request for
proposals, and other criteria set forth herein.

2-25-1. Policy Considerations.
There is an underlying policy in the City strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters involving
Constitutional Taking claims in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of the
uncertainty and expense involved in defending law suits alleging such issues. At the same time, the legitimate role
of government in lawfully regulating real property must be preserved and the public's right to require the
dedication or exaction of property consistent with the Constitution. Consistent with this policy, it is desired that a
procedure be established for the review of actions that may involve the issue of a Constitutional Taking. These
provisions are to assist governments in considering decisions that may involve Constitutional Takings. It is
intended that a procedure for such a review be provided, as well as guidelines for such considerations. This
ordinance is further intended and shall be construed to objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a
specific government action should require payment of just compensation, yet preserve the ability of the City to
lawfully regulate real property and fulfill its other duties and functions.

recorded.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-92-0012, Ren&Amd, 07/07/1992, 7-1-2)
7-3-2. Public Improvement and Repair Bond.
A. Bond Required. Each building permit recipient shall post a public improvement and repair bond with the City.
The bond shall be posted before the City issues the building permit.
(Ord. No. O-92-0012, Ren&Amd, 07/07/1992, 7-1-2; Ord. No. O-02-0034, Amended, 09/24/2002)
B. Bond Waiver. The Chief Building Official may waive all or a portion of the required public improvement and
repair bond under the following circumstances:
1. No Heavy Equipment. The Chief Building Official may waive all or a portion of the public improvement and
repair bond if (1) the building permit recipient proposes to construct improvements that do not require
the use of heavy equipment, and (2) the building permit site already has all required public improvements
(e.g. curb, gutter, sidewalk, and water and sewer connections), and (3) the Chief Building Official finds, in
his sole discretion, that the project creates little risk for cracking or damaging existing sidewalks or other
public improvements, and that the project is unlikely to lead to the tracking of mud, dirt or debris into the
street.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 209
2. Subdivision Bond. The Chief Building Official may waive all or a portion of the public improvement and
repair bond to the extent that the required public improvements are adequately covered by an existing
subdivision bond and the developer of the subdivision proceeds to build on one or more of the lots
located in the subdivision. If a subdivision bond is used to meet the requirements of the public
improvement and repair bond, the last remaining ten percent (10%) or $2,000.00 (whichever is less) of the
subdivision bond shall not be released without the written consent of the Chief Building Official.
3. Site Plan Bond. The Chief Building Official may waive all or a portion of the public improvement and repair
bond to the extent that the required public improvements are adequately covered by an existing site plan
bond. If a site plan bond is used to meet the requirements of the public improvement and repair bond, the
last remaining ten percent (10%) or $2,000.00 (whichever is less) of the site plan bond shall not be
released without the written consent of the Chief Building Official.
The public improvement and repair bond may be aggregated with other required bonds (e.g. a building permit
recipient may submit one bond meeting the requirements of multiple ordinances.) If a building permit
recipient submits an aggregate bond, the City may make draws on the aggregate bond in the same manner
that it would make draws on a public improvement and repair bond.
(Ord. No. O-92-0012, Ren&Amd, 07/07/1992, 7-1-2; Ord. No. O-02-0034, Amended, 09/24/2002)
C. Purpose of Bond. The purpose of the public improvement and repair bond is to guarantee the construction,
repair, and/or replacement of required public improvements, to guarantee the completion of street cleaning
necessitated by construction activity associated with the building permit, and to provide funds necessary to
mediate a site left in a dangerous condition. For purposes of this section, “required public improvements”
include the following improvements associated with a particular building permit:
1. Curb, gutter and sidewalk.
2. Storm sumps, and/or piping, catch basins, detention basins and any other storm water related facilities.
3. Asphalt paving.
4. Fire hydrants.
5. Fencing.
6. Landscaping and sprinkling systems.
7. Water and sewer lines.
8. Driveway approaches.
9. Removal of mud, dirt, and debris from the public rights-of-way (sidewalks, curbs, gutter, and streets).
10. Mediation costs associated with securing a site that has been abandoned by the contractor or left in an
unsafe condition by the contractor.
11. Any other public improvements required by ordinance or required as part of a site plan, conditional use
permit, subdivision plat, or building permit approval. If, for any reason, the funds or bonds set aside or
provided for the guarantee of improvements are insufficient to properly complete the improvements, the
developer shall still be liable to complete the improvements. The bonds required by this section are for the
sole benefit of the City. The bonds are not for the individual benefit of any citizen or identifiable class of
citizens, including the owners or purchasers of lots within a subdivision. The bonds are not for the purpose
of ensuring payment of contractors, subcontractors or suppliers of labor or materials, and no contractors,
subcontractors or suppliers of labor or materials shall have a cause of action against the City or the bond
for providing labor or materials.

(Ord. No. O-92-0012, Ren&Amd, 07/07/1992, 7-1-2; Ord. No. O-02-0034, Amended, 09/24/2002; Ord. No. O-08-0005, Amended
02/12/2008)
D. Bond Amount. The amount of the public improvement and repair bond shall be calculated as follows:
1. Required Public Improvements Constructed as Part of Project. If the project includes the construction of
required public improvements, the amount of the public improvement and repair bond shall be one
hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost of the required public improvements, as determined by
the Chief Building Official. In calculating the estimated cost of the required public improvements, the
Building Official may accept the amount specified in a construction bid as the reasonable cost of the
improvements.
2. Minimum Bond Amount. The minimum amount of the public improvement and repair bond, regardless of
the estimated cost of the required public improvements, shall be as follows:
a. Residential Construction. The minimum amount of a public improvement and repair bond for
residential construction (freestanding single family dwellings) shall be One Thousand Dollars
($1,000.00).
b. Nonresidential Construction. The minimum amount of the public improvement and repair bond for
nonresidential construction (including multiple family dwellings and nonfreestanding single family
dwellings) shall be based on the street frontage of the property with the building permit and
calculated as follows:
i. =100 ft. of street frontage $4,000.00
ii. =200 ft., but more than
100 ft. of street frontage $6,000.00
iii. =300 ft., but more than
200 ft. of street frontage $8,000.00
iv. >300 ft. of street frontage $10,000.00
3. Bond Depletion - Stop Work Orders.
a. Residential Construction. If the City makes a draw on a public improvement and repair bond covering
residential construction that causes the bond to fall below seventy-five percent (75%) of the required
bond amount, then the City may issue a stop work order for the project until the building permit
recipient has replenished the bond to one hundred percent (100%) of the required bond amount.
b. Nonresidential Construction. If the City makes a draw on a public improvement and repair bond
covering nonresidential construction that causes the bond to fall below fifty percent (50%) of the
required bond amount, then the City may issue a stop work order for the project until the building
permit recipient has replenished the bond to one hundred percent (100%) of the required bond
amount.
c. Aggregate Bonds. If an applicant submits an aggregate bond (e.g. one bond meeting the requirements
of both the site plan bond and the public improvement and repair bond), the City may red tag the site
if the portion of the aggregate bond attributable to public improvement and repair bond requirements
falls below 75% of the required bond amount (if the bond covers residential construction) or 50% of
the required bond amount (if the bond covers nonresidential construction.

completed all required public improvements, (2) the City has accepted the required public improvements, (3)
the City issues a final certificate of occupancy for the site, and (4) the Chief Building Official gives written

9-4-9. Right to hearing and appeal.
A. An alarm user shall have the right to request a hearing to contest the imposition of any penalty under this
Article including the imposition of any fee, suspension of any permit, or the determination of a false alarm. A
written request for a hearing must be filed by the alarm user with the Police Department within ten (10)
business days of the date of mailing of the notice of imposition of the penalty. Notice of the imposition of a
penalty shall be considered satisfied if sent by regular mail to the alarm user's address listed in the alarm
user's alarm information card. The request for a hearing shall include the alarm user's name, address,
telephone number, and a statement of the reasons for disputing the imposition of the penalty. A timely
request for a hearing shall stay the imposition of any penalty until the hearing is decided. The City's
determination of a false alarm, the imposition of an administrative service fee, or suspension of a permit shall
be considered final if the alarm user fails to request a hearing within the time period set forth above.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-99-0034, Rep&ReEn, 07/27/1999; Ord. No. O-2017-0005, Amended 02/28/2017)
B. The Chief of Police or his/her designated representative shall conduct hearings requested by alarm users and
shall affirm, modify, or vacate the imposition of the penalty after considering all of the evidence presented. An
alarm shall be presumed to be a false alarm unless the alarm user can establish the existence of an emergency
or other hazard at the time of the alarm by a preponderance of the evidence. The burden of proving the
existence of an emergency shall be upon the alarm user. Hearings shall be conducted informally. Formal rules
of evidence and court procedure shall not apply. Because the hearings are administrative in nature, hearsay is
admissible, but evidence must have some probative weight and reliability to be admitted. The burden of proof
in hearings to determine the imposition of an administrative service fee or the suspension of a permit shall be
a preponderance of the evidence.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-99-0034, Rep&ReEn, 07/27/1999; Ord. No. O-2017-0005, Amended 02/28/2017)
C. An alarm user may appeal the decision of the Chief of Police or his/her designated representative to the City
Manager by filing a written request for a hearing with the City Manager within ten (10) business days of the
decision rendered in the initial hearing. If no request for an appeal hearing is made within the ten day period,
the decision rendered in the initial hearing shall be considered final. The appeal hearing shall be conducted by
the City Manager or his/her designated representative. The City Manager or his/her designated representative
shall affirm, reverse, or modify the decision rendered in the initial hearing and the action taken in the appeal
hearing shall be final.

10-1-1. Statement of Purpose and Authorization
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 245
A. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions to specific areas by provisions designed:
1. To protect human life and health;
2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at
the expense of the general public;
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and
sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special
flood hazard so as to minimize blight to future flood-prone areas;
7. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and,
8. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions.
B. The City of Orem elects to comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-
488, as amended) which is a voluntary program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the City of Orem has elected to join
the program, participate, and enforce this Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance and the requirements and
regulations of the NFIP. The NFIP, established in the aforesaid act, provides that areas of the City of Orem
have a special flood hazard identified by FEMA, and that floodplain management measures should be applied
in such flood hazard areas. Furthermore, the City of Orem may elect to administer the Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance to areas not identified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) by FEMA on the City’s
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), if the City has documentation to support that there is an inherent
risk of flooding in such areas.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-2020-0011, Amended 5/16/2020)
Effective on: 4/10/1990
10-1-2. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.
A. In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and provisions for:
1. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion
hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against
flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which
help accommodate or channel flood waters;
4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and,
5. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or
which may increase flood hazards in other areas.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90)
10-1-3. Statutory Authorization.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 246
Utah Code - Section 10-9a-505 authorizes a municipality to enact an ordinance regulating land use and
development in a floodplain to protect life and to prevent substantial damage or loss to real property.
(Ord. No. O-2020-0011, Enacted 5/16/2020)
10-1-4. Findings of Fact.
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Orem are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
B. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that cause an increase in
flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and
hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage.

Chapter.
A. Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment may appeal such decision to
courts of competent jurisdiction.
B. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State Office of Emergency Management
upon issuing a variance.
C. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half
acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 10-4-3 of this Article have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
D. Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the Board of Adjustment may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this ordinance.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 257
E. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base
flood discharge would result.
F. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure
and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
G. Prerequisites for granting variances:
1. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
2. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. showing a good and sufficient cause;
b. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and
c. a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, the creation of nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
3. Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be
permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
Variances may be issued by the Board of Adjustment for new construction and substantial improvements and for
other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
H. The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

D. Manufactured Homes -
1. All manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A in the City’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using
methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured
homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
2. Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the
City's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or

(Ord. No. O-2020-0011, Amended 5/16/2020)
10-5-4. Standard for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 10-3-2, are areas designated as shallow
flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply in areas
designated as shallow flooding:
A. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade a height equal to or greater than the depth
number specified in feet on the City's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
B. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures;
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 262
1. Shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade a height equal
to or greater than the depth number specified in feet on the City's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth
number is specified), or;
2. together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
C. A registered professional engineer shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the
standards of section 10-4-3 are satisfied.
D. Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters
around and away from proposed structures.
1. FIRMs may also identify areas of shallow flooding hazards with an average depth less than 1 foot deep
(shaded Zone X). These areas may be between the flood hazard boundaries defined for the 1- and 0.2-
percent chance-annual-flood or associated with base flood depths less than 1 foot where a clearly defined
channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity may be evident.
Such flooding is generally characterized by sheet flow; therefore
a. all new construction or substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures in such
areas shall:
i. have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the estimated depth of the base flood
and above the highest groundwater level that is anticipated to occur during periods of flooding.
ii. within shaded X zones, have positive ground slopes away from structures and adequate drainage
paths around structures on sloping ground to guide flood water around and away from proposed
structures.
A registered professional engineer shall submit certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of
this Section are satisfied.
(Ord. No. O-2020-0011, Enacted 5/16/2020)
10-5-5. Floodways.
Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article 10-3 are extremely hazardous areas
due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential.
A. All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction
provisions of this Article 10-5. A designated regulatory floodway may not increase the Base Flood level more
than 1 foot.
B. Encroachments are prohibited in floodways, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other development within an adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the City during the occurrence
of the base flood discharge.
C. The Floodplain Administrator may, pursuant to the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the
National Flood Insurance Regulations, permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that
would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the City first applies for a conditional FIRM
and floodway revision through FEMA.

City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 263
10-5-6. Penalties for Violation.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this Chapter 10 and other applicable regulations. Violation of any provision of this
Chapter 10 (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a Class C misdemeanor. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent, or remedy or abate any violation.

This section defines nuisance by providing five general definitions of what constitutes a nuisance (subsection A),

a nuisance, even though the situation, conduct, or activity may not be listed as a nuisance in the specific
examples. The first three general definitions are taken directly from Utah State law. The purpose of listing the
specific examples is to identify some of the specific situations, conduct and activities that the City intends to abate
as nuisances.

activity or conduct prosecuted may also constitute a nuisance under this ordinance. Nothing in this ordinance

Responsible Person, if terms of the Voluntary Correction Agreement are not met, and that such
abatement, recovery of costs, and fines shall have the same effect as if issued by an Administrative Order;
7. An agreement by the Responsible Person acknowledging that he/she waives the right to appeal the
Enforcement Official’s finding that a nuisance exists and waives the right to appeal the specific corrective
action required in the Voluntary Correction Agreement; and
8. An agreement by the Responsible Person that failure to comply with the Voluntary Correction Agreement
may be grounds for criminal prosecution.
The Enforcement Official may grant an extension of the time limit for correcting or abating the nuisance if the
Responsible Person has shown due diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting or abating the nuisance but
unforeseen circumstances render abatement under the original conditions unattainable. If the Responsible Person
complies with the terms of the Voluntary Correction Agreement, the City shall take no further action against the
Responsible Person related to the nuisance described in the Voluntary Correction Agreement unless the nuisance
recurs.

undue burden upon interstate commerce, such licensee or applicant may apply to the Director for an adjustment
of the fee so as to relieve such burden. The licensee or applicant shall, by supporting affidavits, indicate his
method of doing business and such other information as the Director may deem necessary in order to determine
the extent, if any, of such undue burden. The Director shall then conduct an investigation, comparing the subject
business with other businesses of like nature and shall make findings of fact from which he shall determine
whether the license is discriminatory, unreasonable or unfair as to the licensee or applicant from the standpoint
of its impact on interstate commerce and shall recommend to the City Council an appropriate license fee under
the circumstances and the City Council shall fix the license fee in such amount. If the regular license fee has
already been paid, the City Council shall order refund of the amount over and above the fee fixed, if different. In
fixing the fee to be charged, the Director shall have the power to base the fee on gross receipts or employees, or
may use any other method which will assure that the fee assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on
businesses of like nature; provided, however, that the amount assessed shall in no event exceed the regular fee
prescribed.

fire, or health codes. Any such violations shall be corrected prior to the issuance of a license. In the case of a
dance to be held outdoors, however, the location need only be inspected by an officer of the Police
Department to determine if it is a reasonably safe location for a dance, taking into account traffic, lighting, and
other neighborhood considerations.

Director may deny the license upon the recommendation of the Chief of Police. The Police Chief may only
recommend denial if he:
1. Finds that the applicant does not qualify under subsection (C) above.
2. Finds, after inspection pursuant to subsection (D) above, there is reasonable cause to believe that the
proposed location would be unsafe.
3. Has reasonable cause to believe that adequate security measures either could not or would not be taken
by the applicant in order to insure compliance with subsection (G) below.
4. Finds, based on the proposed location and type of sound system to be used, the anticipated noise level
would unreasonably interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of adjoining properties by the tenants or
owners thereof. In the event that the Director denies a license pursuant to this subsection, the applicant
may appeal the decision to the City Manager by filing a notice of appeal with the Director and paying a
filing fee in an amount established by City Council resolution within ten (10) working days of the denial.

required shall be determined by the City Council as part of the conditional use permit process if the licensee
or applicant is required by this section to obtain a conditional use permit, and otherwise by the Chief of Police.

12-5-8. Solicitors.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to protect city residents from unreasonable intrusions upon residential
privacy, consumer fraud, and deceptive, high-pressure, factually unbalanced, or otherwise unfair consumer
sales practices, in a manner consistent with the constitutional rights of residential commercial solicitors to
communicate their messages to willing residential listeners.
1. Commercial residential solicitation generally represents a greater intrusion upon residential privacy than
political, religious, or other noncommercial door-to-door solicitation involving the dissemination of ideas.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 320
Commercial residential solicitation generally entails a higher incidence of consumer fraud and unfair sales
practices than political, religious, or other noncommercial door-to-door solicitation involving the
dissemination of ideas. Substantial numbers of city residents do not desire to listen to or otherwise receive
commercial solicitations. Additionally, some residents are particularly vulnerable to consumer fraud and
unfair consumer sales practices by commercial residential solicitors.
2. The Orem Department of Public Safety (hereinafter, the “Department”) has investigated complaints and
problems relating to residential solicitation within the City, including the following: The Department
investigated fourteen complaints involving residential solicitation in 2006 and twenty-six complaints in
2007. Residents complained, among other things, about residential solicitors trespassing, surveilling
residents’ property, refusing to leave the complainant’s property when asked, contacting residents at
homes posted with a “No Solicitation” sign, selling stolen property, representing nonexistent businesses,
claiming to represent a legitimate business when in fact they didn’t, and using aggressive sales techniques.
Based upon such investigation, the Department has concluded that commercial door-to-door solicitation
within the City often involves intrusions upon residential privacy, consumer fraud, and unfair consumer
sales practices.
3. The Department has found consumer fraud and deceptive, high-pressure, factually unbalanced, or
otherwise unfair consumer sales practices are employed significantly less frequently in cases of charitable
solicitation and solicitation occurring incident to political, religious, and other noncommercial speech
entailing the dissemination of ideas.
4. The transient nature of the business of residential solicitation makes it difficult to prosecute or to obtain
redress for intrusions upon residential privacy and fraudulent or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices
by residential solicitors because such solicitors are typically nonresidents of the City and often leave the
City immediately upon completion of their commercial solicitation of the City. Furthermore, many
companies that employ residential solicitors do not conduct accurate, thorough, and timely criminal
background checks on prospective solicitors.
5. Because commercial residential solicitation (a) involves the attempt to complete an economic transaction
with the hearer, and (b) may include aggressive, deceptive, factually unbalanced, or otherwise unfair
tactics in an effort to complete an economic transaction, commercial residential solicitation entails a
heightened risk of intrusion upon residential privacy, consumer fraud, and unfair consumer sales practices,
albeit by a minority of those engaged in this business. The City wishes to reassure residents to the extent
reasonably possible consistent with the First Amendment that the residential commercial solicitors who
work within the City have not been the subject of criminal actions, consumer protection actions, or other
legal orders or actions reasonably related to the risk of such solicitors’ intruding upon residential privacy
or committing consumer fraud or other unfair consumer sales practices, by instituting a residential
solicitation registration procedure.
6. The Council finds that the potential and actual harm to citizens from residential solicitation is real, and
that the provisions hereinafter set forth will to a material degree alleviate and avoid such harm. The
Council has determined that the means chosen as hereinafter stated are reasonable and are closely fitted
to achieve the desired objective of protecting citizens from intrusions upon residential privacy, consumer
fraud, and unfair consumer sales practices, while simultaneously preserving the rights of others to engage
in speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and relevant state
constitutional provisions. The regulations adopted herein are narrowly drawn and in the judgment of the
Council are not more extensive than necessary to serve and protect the interests stated.

organization, its products, or services, on whose behalf a solicitation is made or as to the moral
character of the Registered Solicitor.
e. The following statement shall appear on each Certificate of Registration: “THE CITY OF OREM MAKES

Solicitor whose Certificate of Registration authorizes soliciting on behalf of a person or firm named in a

shall be revoked by the City if, following issuance of the Certificate of Registration, the City determines
that the Registered Solicitor was convicted of a violation of this Section or committed an act or became
subject to a condition that would disqualify him or her from receiving a Certificate of Registration under
subsection (E)(4) above. Notice of revocation shall be immediately given to the Registered Solicitor by
personal service or certified mail to the address listed on the Application and, if applicable, to the
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 326
organization for which the Registered Solicitor was soliciting. The notice shall set forth the factual basis for
the revocation and, if applicable, the specific provision(s) of subsection (E)(4) above that identifies and

badge to the City.

The City Council of the City of Orem finds that an excess of unregulated signage causes visual blight in the City,

values, may displace alternative land uses, and may pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation.

14-1-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this sign ordinance is to protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of City
residents and businesses by regulating the design, materials, size, construction, installation, location and
maintenance of signs and sign structures in a manner consistent with the First Amendment of the United States
Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Utah in order to achieve the following goals and objectives:
A. To minimize distractions and obstructions that may be caused by signs and thereby reduce potential hazards
to motorists and pedestrians;
B. To preserve and improve the natural beauty and aesthetic quality of the City by reducing the visual clutter
caused by an excess of signs and to thereby increase the desirability of the City as a place to live and work and
as an attraction for nonresidents to visit;
C. To encourage signs that are harmonious with the property on which they are located;
D. To safeguard and enhance property values;
E. To provide for ample and adequate means of communication of both commercial and noncommercial
messages to the public;

14-1-4. Sign Zones.
The location and boundaries of the zones wherein the various types of signs allowed by this Chapter may be
placed are shown on the map entitled "Sign Zone Map of the City of Orem" which is part of this Chapter and
which shall have the force and effect of law.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-09-0014, Amended 06/23/2009); Ord. No. O-2013-0027, Amended 10/22/2013)
14-1-5. Interpretation.
A. The provisions of this Chapter shall be final. Signs not specifically allowed herein shall be prohibited.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-94-0032, Ren&Amd, 11/08/94, 14-1-7; Ord. No. O-2013-0027, Amended 10/22/2013)
B. A noncommercial message of any type is allowed on any permitted sign and may be substituted for any duly
permitted or allowed commercial message or any duly permitted or allowed noncommercial message,
provided that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such
substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. This provision prevails
over any more specific provision to the contrary within this sign code. The purpose of this provision is to
prevent inadvertently favoring commercial speech over noncommercial speech. This provision does not create
a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot, building or structure, nor does it affect the
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 382
requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted or otherwise excuse compliance
with other applicable regulations contained within this sign code with respect to the physical characteristics
and location of signs.

C. The Orem City Council intends that this sign ordinance be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the
free speech protections and provisions of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of
Utah.

D. Where a sign fits under more than one sign definition, the regulations for all applicable sign categories shall
apply with the most restrictive taking precedence over any less restrictive provisions, unless a contrary intent
is clearly indicated.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-94-0032, Ren&Amd, 11/08/94, 14-1-7; Ord. No. O-2013-0027, Amended 10/22/2013)
14-1-6. Appeals.
Any person who has been ordered by the City to alter or remove any sign, or any person whose application for a
sign permit has been refused, may appeal to the Board of Adjustment by filing a written appeal with Development
Services within ten (10) calendar days of the receipt of the order or refusal of the City. The applicant shall also pay
a fee for such appeal as set forth by resolution of the City Council. Any appeal shall be solely for the purpose of
reviewing the interpretation given the terms of the Chapter by the City, and not to vary the terms in any way.
Upon filing of the appeal, the City shall take no further action with regard to the removal of the sign involved until
the Board of Adjustment makes a final decision on the appeal. However, if the City finds that the sign presents an
immediate or serious danger to the public, the City shall proceed immediately to have the sign altered or
removed.

C. The City Engineer may waive or modify the requirements of this Article 16-3 if the City Engineer finds that (1)
special circumstances attached to the property or the location of existing improvements on the property

safety and efficiency would not be compromised with the modification. In determining whether traffic safety
and efficiency would be compromised, the City Engineer may consider the existence of traffic control devices,
the grade of the streets, the angle and curvature of the intersection, the location of existing or proposed site
improvements, the average number of daily trips on the streets comprising the intersection, the eighty-fifth
percentile speeds, the condition of existing public improvements, the classification of the street, the agency

This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision Ordinance of the City of Orem, Utah."
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002)
17-1-2. Purposes.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 435
A. The purposes of this Chapter are:
1. To promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the City of Orem.
2. To ensure the efficient and orderly development of land within the City of Orem.
3. To prevent the uncontrolled division and development of real property, which may be done without
considering the rights and best interests of adjoining property owners and the City of Orem as a whole.
4. To avoid poorly planned developments that:
a. Do not comply with the Orem General Plan or City of Orem ordinances;
b. Cannot be adequately served by existing utilities or public services;
c. May prove to be dangerous or unsafe;
d. May cause an undue burden on existing traffic or transportation services; or
e. May require the future expenditure of public funds to correct problems caused by the development.
5. To minimize the number of boundary line disputes in the City and to eliminate existing property line gaps
and property line overlaps.
6. To provide a mechanism requiring each developer to pay for the public improvements associated with a
particular subdivision, and to provide a mechanism for each subdivision to pay its fair share of increased
burdens on existing public services.
7. To provide design standards for public improvements, facilities and utilities, to provide for accesses to
public rights-of-way, to provide for the dedication of land and streets deemed necessary for the proper
development of the subdivision, and to provide for easements or rights-of-way that are necessary to
service the property.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002)
B. This Chapter is designed to inform the subdivision developer and the public of the requirements for obtaining
subdivision plat approval. To this end, an attempt has been made to outline all subdivision requirements in
this Chapter and other applicable ordinances and laws. Because each parcel of real property is unique and has
its own set of problems to be dealt with, and because there may be some aspects of subdivision development
that cannot be easily articulated, it is not possible to cover every possible contingency. Therefore, the
Planning Commission and/or the City Manager have the authority to impose reasonable conditions upon a
subdivider in addition to those expressly required, provided that:
1. The conditions are not arbitrary or capricious;
2. The Planning Commission and/or the City Manager finds that the conditions are necessary to promote the
health, safety or welfare of the citizens of Orem; and
3. The conditions do not conflict with any applicable law.
(Ord. No. 661, Rev ised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002)
17-1-3. Violation of Subdivision Ordinance.
Unless otherwise specified by State law or this Chapter, the violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter shall
be a Class C misdemeanor. This provision shall not be used against City officers and staff in their good faith
attempts to administer and enforce the terms of this Chapter.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002)
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 436
17-1-4. Enforcement.
The City Manager is hereby designated and authorized as the officer charged with the enforcement of this
Chapter.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002)
17-1-5. Variances and Appeals.
A. The Board of Adjustment may, upon application of an aggrieved party and payment of the appropriate fee,
authorize a variance from the terms of this Chapter. A variance may be granted only if it will not be contrary to
the public interest and if there are special conditions making literal enforcement of this Chapter an
unnecessary hardship on the applicant; provided, that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and
substantial justice done. Before any variance may be authorized, however, it shall be shown that:
1. The variance will not substantially affect the City's Master Plan or development ordinances and that
adherence to the strict letter of the ordinance will cause difficulties and hardships, the imposition of which
upon the petitioner is unnecessary in order to carry out the general purpose of the City's Master Plan and
development ordinances;
2. There are special circumstances attached to the property covered by the application which do not
generally apply to the other property in the same zone;
3. Because of said special circumstances, property covered by the application is deprived of privileges
possessed by other properties in the same zone; and that the granting of the variance is essential to the
enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the same zone.
In granting the variance, the Board of Adjustment may impose such additional conditions as will, in its judgment,
substantially secure the objectives of the standard or requirement that is waived or modified.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002)
B. The power of the Board of Adjustment to grant variances shall be strictly construed, and it is the intent of this
Section that variances be granted only in cases of extreme hardship, and that only minor variances be granted.
Before granting any variance, the Board shall make the findings required by Subsection A. above. The findings
shall be supported by facts that are made a part of the record of the Board meeting where the variance is
granted. Economic hardship shall not be deemed a sufficient reason for granting a variance.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002)
C. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the City Staff or the Planning Commission in the application of this
Chapter may appeal in writing first to the City Council. An application for appeal to the City Council must be
filed in the office of Development Services within thirty (30) days after the date of the decision being
appealed.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002)

application for appeal to the Board of Adjustment must be filed in the office of Development Services within
ten (10) day after the date of the decision being appealed.

(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002)
17-1-7. Amendments.
All proposed amendments to this Chapter shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission for its consideration and
recommendations. Upon receiving the recommendation of the Planning Commission, or upon the Planning
Commission’s failure to act within thirty (30) days of receiving a request from the City Council to consider a
proposed amendment to this Chapter, the City Council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendments.
After closing the public hearing, the City Council may vote to approve, modify, or disapprove the proposed
amendments, or may take any other action allowed by applicable laws. Proceedings to amend any provision of
CHAPTER 17 shall be deemed to have been formally initiated by the City for purposes of Utah Code Section 10-9a-
509(1)(a)(ii) upon the consideration of such proposal by the Planning Commission at a regularly scheduled
meeting. The Planning Commission shall not be required to take any definitive action with respect to the proposal
or to spend any given amount of time on the application in order for the proposed amendment to be deemed
formally initiated. Any subsequent modification of the proposed ordinance amendment by City staff, the Planning
Commission, or the City Council shall not alter the status of the application as having been formally initiated.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Rep&ReEn 01/08/2002; Ord. No. O-07-0039, Amended 08/14//2007)
17-1-8. Conflict.

City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 454
C. In determining the particular needs of the subdivision and in determining whether any of the improvements
specified in 17-6-1(B) should be required in a particular subdivision, the City Engineer shall consider, among
other things:
1. Recommendations from staff, the DRC, or the Planning Commission.

subdivision causes or contributes to the need for off-site improvements but the developer is not required to
install them, the City may impose an impact fee as allowed by law, or may otherwise require financial
contribution pursuant to written agreements between the City and the Developer. Whether or not the
developer actually installs the improvements, the City may require that owners of other undeveloped
properties, the development of which will also contribute to the need for the improvements, pay impact fees
or be party to such agreements. The fees or the monies collected pursuant to such agreements shall be used
towards the costs of installing the improvements. Whether off-site improvements are installed or financed in
whole or in part by the Developer through the use of impact fees or agreements, the City shall follow the
requirements of all applicable statutory and case law in arriving at a just and equitable distribution of the
costs of the improvements. Written findings shall be made by the City showing the reasons and justification
for the allocation of the costs. This Subsection shall not apply in the case of required off-site water and sewer
systems, the financing of which is covered by Subsections 17-6-5(B) and (C).

cost of installing the larger lines as provided in Section 17-6-5(B).
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-98-0043, Amended, 09/22/1998; Ord. No. O-02 0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002)
F. All required improvements shall be completed and pass City inspections within one (1) year of the date that
the final plat is recorded. Required improvements for plats recorded between November 1 and March 31
must be completed by the next October 1. For example, the required improvements for a plat recorded on
February 6, 1990 must be completed by October 1, 1990. Failure to meet this time frame will result in
forfeiture of the bond. All curb, gutter, sidewalk, base gravel, and compaction must be installed in accordance
with the City's Construction Standards and Specifications and approved by the City before any temporary or
final occupancy permits will be issued for any lot in the subdivision.

this subsection would make it impossible to place a driveway or drive access on a desired lot line and still
comply with subsection (B)(2) above because of the existence of a fence on another lot, the twenty-five foot
requirement shall not apply, but the driveway or drive access shall be located as far as possible from the fence
while still complying with subsection (B)(2).

for pedestrian access to public places such as churches, schools, parks, neighborhood shopping areas, etc.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Amended, 01/08/2002)
B. The developer shall install concrete surface the full width and length of a walkway.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Amended, 01/08/2002)
C. The developer shall install a chain link fence at least four feet in height on each side of the walkway for its full
length. The fence shall be owned and maintained by the property owners adjacent to such walkway. The
walkway shall be owned by the property owners with a public access easement in favor of the City.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Amended, 01/08/2002)
17-7-10. Lots.
A. Every parcel of land created by a subdivision shall comply with the minimum lot size requirements of the City
Zoning Ordinance, and except as otherwise provided herein, shall be platted as part of a subdivision. It shall be
unlawful to create or maintain a protection or nuisance strip.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002)
B. Where a major canal for which a fence is required is part of any lot in a subdivision, the area of the portion of
the canal which is located on the lot shall not be included in the computation of total lot size nor side or rear
yard setbacks for purposes of determining compliance with the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002)
C. All lots within a residential zone shall abut upon and have access to a dedicated street except as provided
herein or in the Zoning Ordinance of the City. Any non-residentially zoned lot that does not abut upon a
dedicated street must show access to a dedicated street by easements across other property.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002)
D. All lot corners, points of curvature, tangency, and bearing changes shall be marked with permanent metal
stakes approved by the City. The front corners of the lot shall be marked in the sidewalk. It shall be unlawful
for any person to remove any stake placed in the ground or mark made in the sidewalk pursuant to this
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 466
subsection unless he does so as part of an official survey. It shall also be unlawful for any builder to commence
construction on any lot without having all survey stakes in place.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002)
E. Lots in a subdivision may not be designed to have double frontage unless, in the opinion of the City, it is
necessary to reduce traffic hazards, allow for unusual site conditions, or if a proposed subdivision and any
area adjacent thereto will be aesthetically enhanced thereby. The rear portion of a double frontage lot
adjacent to a street shall be enclosed with a sight-obscuring fence no greater than six feet (6') in height
installed by the developer, which shall be treated with anti-graffiti sealant. However, the Planning Commission
may prohibit the fence if the fence may cause an increase in safety hazards. The height of the fence shall be
measured from the top elevation of the sidewalk, or in the case of uneven natural topography, the
measurement may be taken from the natural grade at the base of the fence on the side of the property being
enclosed. Fences placed on property line at the back of the sidewalk shall have a masonry ribbon curbing
placed at the base of the fence to prevent weeds from growing and protruding under the fence into the public
right-of-way. In those locations where the fence is located on the property line, the developer shall also install
a six-foot (6') wide sidewalk. Vehicular access through the rear of a lot may be approved by the Planning
Commission; however, the Planning Commission shall not approve any access to the rear or side yard if the
rear or side yard is adjacent to 800 North Street or any other arterial street. The Planning Commission may
approve a fence set back from the property line, provided the property line is not in common with a right-ofway
line of an arterial street, and provided the property owner submits a landscape plan approved by the
Planning Commission for that portion of the property between the fence and the sidewalk and provided a
covenant to maintain the property according to the approved landscape plan is recorded on the subdivision
plat and in a recorded agreement between the City and the property owner that runs with the land. In the
event the fence is set back from the sidewalk on private property and said landscape agreement is approved
and recorded, the fence may be increased in height at a ratio based on a maximum height of eight feet (8')
measured ten feet (10') from the back of the sidewalk. Berms or other artificially created landscape features
may not be used to increase the height of the natural grade when determining fence height. The materials
used for the sight-obscuring fence shall blend in with the design of the subdivision and adjacent properties,
and shall be approved by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may waive or modify the fence
requirement provided it finds the lot has unusual site conditions and the waiver or modification will not
adversely affect the aesthetics, safety, and privacy of the lot and adjacent area. If a subdivision is to have a
landscaped common area adjacent to the fence at the back lot line, a homeowners' association shall be
formed to ensure the maintenance of the common area. The fence required by this paragraph shall be
installed before a temporary or final occupancy permit is granted for any lot in the subdivision that borders
the fence.

F. The City may prohibit lots from fronting onto or from having direct vehicular access to any arterial, major
collector or collector street in cases where the City deems it to be necessary to promote traffic safety and
where access to another street is possible. In the alternative, the City may require lots which front onto any
arterial, major collector or collector street to share an access. Where possible, any residential subdivision
adjacent to 800 North Street or any other arterial street shall be designed in such a way as to prevent direct
vehicular access from any lot directly on to 800 North Street or other such arterial street.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002)
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 467
G. The maximum grade between the back of the sidewalk and the floor of the garage or carport shall be 10%.
This provision may be waived if:
1. The natural grade of the lot exceeds 10%, or the proposed grade is necessary to adequately drain the
property, or the applicant presents another compelling reason for waiving the maximum grade; and
2. The City Engineer finds that the waiver of maximum grade provision is in the best interests of the public
and will not substantially harm adjacent property owners.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002)
H. Driveways must rise at least six inches (6") between the back of the sidewalk and the floor of the garage or
carport. Residential driveway drainage must be directed toward landscaped areas. Sidewalks that are not
directly behind curbs shall drain into landscaped areas.

17-7-11. Easements.
A. Each lot shall have the following perpetual public utility easements:
1. An easement ten feet (10') in width adjacent to all public streets, unless the street has buffered sidewalks,
then the easement width shall be in accordance with Appendix K;
2. An easement five feet (5') in width along the rear property line; except that where the rear property line is
contiguous with an outside boundary line of the subdivision, the easement shall be eight feet (8') in width;
3. An easement five feet (5') in width along one of the side lot lines. The side of the lot on which this
easement is located shall be alternated from lot to lot so that the side easement for each lot abuts the side
easement of the adjoining lot.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd, 01/08/2002; Ord. No. O-04-0032, Amended, 08/24/2004)
B. No above-ground utility structures shall be placed in the front property easement nor in the side easement for
a distance of at least twenty feet (20') from the front property line. This requirement may be waived by the
City Engineer for existing improvements or situations when underground utilities would be unnecessary or too
costly.
(Ord. No. O-96-0002, Enacted, 01/02/1996; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002)
C. Easements for surface water runoff drainage, canals, irrigation ditches, waterways, public utilities, clear vision
areas, sidewalks, and rights-of-way within the subdivision and across adjoining property may be required by
the City when necessary to properly serve the subdivision or protect the citizens of the City.
(Ord. No. O-96-0002, Enacted, 01/02/1996; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002)
D. Only the City and utility agencies which have a valid, current franchise agreement with the City may locate
facilities within a public utility easement. In order to promote the orderly installation and maintenance of
utilities, the City shall have the right to determine the location within the public utility easement where a
public utility agency may locate its facilities.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-00-0013, Amended, 02/22/2000; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd, 01/08/2002)
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 468
E. The Planning Commission may vacate a public utility easement upon finding that all applicable public utility
agencies, including those responsible for natural gas, electric power, cable television, telephone, storm
system, sewer, culinary water and other services deemed to be of a public-utility nature by the City, have
provided written assurance to the City that the public utility easement proposed to be vacated is not currently
being used for such utility and will not be needed for the future use of such utilities.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-00-0013, Amended, 02/22/2000; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd, 01/08/2002)
F. The City Engineer may waive or modify the requirement for a public utility easement under this section if the
easement has not been recorded and the City Engineer determines that the public utility easement is not
needed for existing or future utilities.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-00-0013, Amended, 02/22/2000; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd, 01/08/2002)

17-7-13. Fencing Major Canals.
A. The developer of any parcel being subdivided which is adjacent to or has within its boundaries the right of way
of the Murdock, West Union, North Union, or the Lake Bottom canals shall provide and construct along such
right of way a fence that effectively keeps people away from the canal area. The height of the fence shall be
six feet (6') minimum and seven feet (7') maximum. Chain link fences shall be constructed in accordance with
the City Construction Standards and Specifications and shall have a wire stiffener at the bottom. All fences
shall match the grade at the bottom of the fence so that there are no gaps between the fence and the ground.
The developer shall install a concrete strip, if necessary, to eliminate gaps between the bottom of the fence
and the ground. As an alternative to fencing the canal, and with the consent of the City Engineer, the
developer may pipe the canal. If the canal is piped, the developer must obtain permission from the canal
company and meet all the requirements of Section 17-7-15 of this Chapter.

17-8-1. Deep Lot (or Flag Lot) Development.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish development criteria for subdivisions of parcels that may
not contain the minimum lot width as specified in Section 22-6-8 of the Orem City Code. Parcels of this nature
generally have only a private driveway or right-of-way leading from a dedicated street to the buildable area of
the lot. These parcels shall be referred to as "deep lots" or "flag lots" and subdivisions containing deep lots
shall be referred to as “deep lot subdivisions.” The City may approve deep lots only when it is impossible or
impractical to develop property according to normal subdivision standards.

No. O-02-0001, Ren&Amd 01/08/2002; Ord. No. O-07-0018, Amended 03/13/2007)
B. Area and Width Requirements. The area of a deep lot in the R5, R6, R6.5, R7.5, R8 and R12 zones must be at
least 125% of the required area of a lot within the zone in which it is located. The required width and/or area
of a lot in a deep lot subdivision may include the area of the private driveway only if:
1. The private driveway is included in the lot:
2. No more than ten percent (10%) of the required area of the lot consists of the area of the private
driveway;
3. That portion of the private driveway is located adjacent to the lot in which it is included and is not in the
nature of a “flag stem” (as shown in Appendix P) with respect to the lot in which it is included; and
4. No lot area reduction has been applied to the lot pursuant to Section 22-6-8(C).
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-96-0002, Amended, 01/02/1996; Ord. No. O-99-0005, Amended 01/26/1999; Ord. No. O-

0018, Amended 03/13/2007)
C. Development Requirements. A deep lot may be created and developed on a private drive or right-of-way in
any residential zone provided all the following conditions exist:
1. No property located within a recorded subdivision is used to create a deep lot.
2. No private drive accessing a deep lot is allowed from a cul-de-sac bulb.
3. The property cannot be subdivided with public streets and standard size lots, either at the time of the
application or in the foreseeable future. An adjacent property owner’s unwillingness to develop his/her
property at the same time or in conjunction with a neighboring property owner does not require the City
to approve a deep lot subdivision.
4. The deep lot has no frontage on a dedicated street except for the access, which may be a private drive or
right-of-way. The access shall be no wider than twenty-six feet (26'). No part of a deep lot (except for the
access) may be located within eighty (80) feet of any point of intersection between the access and the
street from which it has access.
5. The private drive or right-of-way serving the property is paved with either concrete or asphalt at least
twenty feet (20') in width if there are no more than two deep lots served by the drive and at least twentysix
feet (26’) in width if more than two deep lots are served by the drive. The private drive or right-of-way
shall be designated on the final plat as a right-of-way easement for the perpetual use of the lots within the
proposed deep lot subdivision and as a public utility easement. Concrete curbs measuring six (6) inches by
eighteen (18) inches shall be installed on both sides of a private drive or right-of-way.
6. A private drive or right-of-way shall not service more than four (4) deep lots and each deep lot shall have
no more than one (1) single-family dwelling per lot.
7. A house on a deep lot in the R5, R6, R6.5, R7.5, and R8 zones shall not exceed one story above grade
except in the following situations:
a. A house on a deep lot with a net area (excluding the area of any “flag stem”) of at least 15,000 square
feet shall not be restricted to a single-story provided all setbacks to adjacent property lines are at least
twenty-five (25) feet.
b. An existing house with the two stories that was constructed on a deep lot prior to March 13, 2007,
may have an addition that is two stories provided the house with the addition has two setbacks that
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 471
are at least twenty-five (25) feet and the remaining two setbacks meet the requirements for side yard
setbacks (for side yards with an attached garage) for the zone in which the lot is located.
8. The maximum height of a house on a deep lot in the R12, R20, ROS, and OS5 zones shall be twenty-seven
(27) feet. However, a house on a deep lot in the R12, R20, ROS, and OS5 zones may be constructed to a
height up to thirty-five (35) feet provided that all exterior setbacks (setbacks from adjacent parcels not a
part of the deep lot subdivision) are equal to or greater than the height of the house.

D. Setbacks. The minimum setbacks for the primary structure on a deep lot shall be as follows:
1. At least two (2) of the setbacks on all deep lots shall be at least twenty-five (25') feet.
2. All other setbacks for deep lots approved prior to March 13, 2007, shall conform to the side yard setback
requirements outlined in Article 22-6.
3. For deep lots approved after March 13, 2007:
a. If the height of the primary structure is twenty-seven (27) feet or less, the setback from the deep lot
subdivision’s exterior lot boundary shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet. All other setbacks shall be
at least twelve (12) feet (at least two of the setbacks shall be at least twenty-five feet as required by
subsection (1)).
b. If the height of the primary structure exceeds twenty-seven (27) feet, all exterior setbacks (setbacks
from adjacent parcels not a part of the deep lot subdivision) shall be equal to or greater than the
height of the structure. All other setbacks shall be at least twelve (12) feet (at least two of the setbacks
shall be at least twenty-five feet as required by subsection (1)).
4. All primary structures shall be set back at least five feet (5’) from a private drive accessing a deep lot.
5. Garage doors and carport entries that face a deep lot access shall be set back at least eighteen (18) feet
from the private drive accessing the deep lot.

17-8-2. Hillside Developments.
A. All property within a hillside area shall be subject to the provisions of this section. All references to grades or
slopes shall mean the grade or slope in its natural state. Where the natural state of a slope cannot be
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 472
definitively determined, the natural state of a slope shall be determined by reference to the City’s 1978 aerial
map.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Amended, 01/08/2002; Ord. No. O-2010-0015, Amended 05/25/2010)
B. No grading shall take place on a hillside area until a grading plan has been submitted to and approved by the
City. All grading shall conform to the grading plan. This applies to both lots of record and subdivision lots.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Amended, 01/08/2002; Ord. No. O-2010-0015, Amended 05/25/2010)
C. Every lot intended for building construction shall have a minimum buildable area behind the front setback line
of at least forty percent (40%) of the minimum lot area required by the zone in which the lot is located, prior
to any grading.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-02-0001, Amended, 01/08/2002)
D. Any area on a lot or parcel that has an average slope of thirty-five percent (35%) or greater shall remain
ungraded except as provided below. The City Engineer may allow grading on twenty-five percent (25%) of all
such slope areas on a lot or parcel provided all of the following requirements are met:
1. The proposed slope area can be graded without the use of a retaining wall or other methods of retainage
(such as gabions, fabrics, spray-on materials, etc.) and without negatively impacting the stability of any
part of the thirty-five percent (35%) slope area or any other part of the lot or parcel, or an adjoining lot or
parcel.
2. The proposed grading will not increase the slope of any part of the graded area above its natural slope.
3. The applicant submits a geo-technical report prepared by a qualified engineer showing that the above
conditions are met.
4. No structure may be constructed in a natural slope area of thirty-five percent (35%) or greater unless:
a. No part of a thirty-five percent (35%) or greater slope located uphill from the structure on the same lot
or parcel is graded.

19-5-1. Legislative Purpose.
This Article is enacted in response to the serious adverse effects caused in certain areas and neighborhoods of the
City of Orem by motor vehicle congestion, particularly the parking of motor vehicles on the streets of such areas
and neighborhoods by individuals parking in the area or neighborhood to visit facilities in adjacent areas. As set
forth in more specific detail in section 19-5-2 of this article, such long–term parking by non–residents threatens
the health, safety and welfare of all the residents of the City of Orem. In order to protect and promote the
integrity of these areas and neighborhoods, it is necessary to enact parking regulations restricting unlimited
parking by non–residents therein, while providing the opportunity for residents to park near their homes. Uniform
parking regulations restricting residents and non–residents alike would not serve the public interest. Rather such
regulation would contribute to neighborhood decline. For the reasons set forth in this article, a system of
preferential resident parking is enacted hereby for the City of Orem.
(Ord. No. O-01-0050, Enacted, 12/11/2001)
19-5-2. Legislative Findings.
A. General Finding. The City Council finds as a result of public testimony and evidence derived from reliable
sources, that the continued vitality of certain areas of the City of Orem depends on the preservation of safe,
healthy, and attractive neighborhoods and other residential areas therein. Since there is in certain areas of the
city at any one time a large surplus of motor vehicles exceeding available on and off–street parking spaces,
this condition detracts from a healthy and orderly environment. A system of preferential resident parking will
serve to reduce a number of strains on residents of the city and thus promote the general public welfare.
(Ord. No. O-01-0050, Enacted, 12/11/2001)
B. Specific Findings. The following specific legislative findings of the City Council in support of preferential
resident parking are set forth as illustrations of the need compelling the enactment of this Article. They are
intended as illustrations only and do not exhaust the subject of the factual basis supporting its adoption:
1. The safety, health, and welfare of the residents of the city can be greatly enhanced by maintenance of the
attractiveness and livability of its neighborhoods and other residential areas;
2. It is a fact of modern living in the city that a majority of residents of the City of Orem possess automobiles
and as a result are daily faced with the need to store these automobiles in or near their residences;
3. Certain neighborhoods and areas of the city are often burdened by influxes of motor vehicles owned by
non–neighborhood residents which compete for inadequate available on–street parking spaces, congest
City streets and highways, and detract from neighborhood values. Further, such influx of nonresident
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 503
vehicles parking in the limited off-street parking spaces often disrupts basic essential services, such as
trash collection and mail delivery, by blocking access to garbage cans, mail boxes, etc.;
4. There further exist certain parking "attractors" within the City of Orem, i.e. hospitals, schools, industrial
and educational complexes, employment centers, UTA stops and stations, and locations convenient for
commuter parking, which further aggravate resident parking problems;
5. Unnecessary vehicle miles, noise, pollution, and strains on relationships between residents and
nonresidents caused by the conditions set forth herein work unacceptable hardships on residents of these
neighborhoods and other residential areas by causing the deterioration of air quality, safety, tranquility,
aesthetics and other values available in a residential environment;
6. If allowed to continue unchecked, these adverse effects on the residents of the city will contribute to a
further decline of the living conditions therein, a reduction in the attractiveness of residing within the City
and consequent injury to the general public welfare;
7. A system of preferential residential parking as enacted in this Article will serve to increase pedestrian and
traffic safety by reducing traffic congestion, promoting the health and welfare of all the residents of the
City by reducing unnecessary personal motor vehicle travel, noise and pollution, and promoting
improvements in air quality, the convenience and attractiveness of urban residential living, and the
increased use of public mass transit facilities available now and in the future, and encouraging the use of
car pools. The public welfare will also be served by ensuring a more stable and valuable property tax base
in order to generate the revenues necessary to provide essential public services.

bear any administrative costs in connection therewith;

proposed for parking restriction;

request that an area be so designated, the City Manager, or his designee shall direct that the necessary
investigation, survey or study be completed to determine whether or not the proposed area is impacted to a
degree that would warrant such a designation. The results of such investigation, survey or study shall then be
presented to the City Council for consideration.
(Ord. No. O-01-0050, Enacted, 12/11/2001)

person shall be entitled to appear and be heard, subject to appropriate rules of order. Following the hearing,

modification of boundaries of the proposed area and any time or other restrictions imposed on such proposed
area. In order to establish a permit parking area, the Council shall find that the designation will be a benefit to
the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, and general welfare of persons residing in the area of designation.

19-7-1. Definitions.
The terms and definitions as contained in Section 12-5-13(A) are herein incorporated by reference.
(Ord. No. O-03-0008, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-08-0020, Amended 08/14/2008)
19-7-2. Legislative Findings.
A. General Finding. A number of parking enforcement and towing companies conduct business within the City
and want to be placed on the Police Department’s rotation list. While most of these companies conduct
business in a reputable way, there have been instances of questionable practices. The City Council therefore
finds as a result of public input and evidence derived from reliable sources, that there is a need to
license/register companies wanting to work in the City and to set requirements for being placed on the Police
Department’s rotation list.
(Ord. No. O-03-0008, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-08-0020, amended 08/14/2008; Ord. No. O-2017-0005, Amended 02/28/2017)
B. Specific Findings. The following specific legislative findings of the City Council in support of
licensing/registering parking enforcement and towing companies and their ability to be placed on the rotation
list are set forth as illustrations of the need compelling the enactment of this Article. They are intended as
illustrations only and are not all-inclusive.
1. Towing companies are needed to tow vehicles from traffic accidents, tow disabled or inoperable vehicles,
or impound vehicles upon request of a public safety officer. In these instances, prompt response time is of
the essence, especially when there is a need to clear an accident scene. Towing companies that fail to
respond in a timely manner add to the confusion and delay in clearing these scenes.
2. Towing companies are responsible for clearing the scene of accident-related debris. When towing
companies fail to do this or fail to completely clean the scene, motorists are exposed to driving around or
over broken glass, vehicle fluids, and other debris which has the potential of harming their vehicles.
3. There is a need for parking enforcement and towing services within the City. Many businesses, apartment
complexes and other private parking lots have a problem with individuals parking in these lots who either
do not have permission or are parked in areas where they should not be parking. In order to discourage
these individuals from parking where they should not, owners of these lots have a need for parking
enforcement and towing services.
4. There are parking lots within the City where it is not apparent that parking is prohibited but from which a
vehicle may be towed. In order that there be no question as to whether a vehicle may be towed from a
parking lot, adequate signs stating that towing will take place should be posted at all entry points to the
parking lots.
5. Being on the Department of Public Safety’s rotation list is a privilege and not a right. To be eligible to be on
the list, parking enforcement and towing companies must comply with the rules and regulations as set
forth in this Article and Section 12-5-13 of the Orem City Code.
6. The Police Department receives a regular number of confirmed reports from citizens of towing companies
that engage in questionable business practices. In an effort to curtail these practices, companies that are
found to engage in these types of activities will be in jeopardy of being taken off the rotation list and/or
subject to criminal penalties as provided in this Article.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 516
7. In the past, personal property has been stolen from vehicles that have been towed. Personnel from towing
companies have been charged with the thefts. In an effort to prevent this type of activity in the future and
to limit those individuals who will be allowed to tow vehicles to those without a history of property crime,
background checks will be conducted on towing company employees prior to being allowed to tow
vehicles within the City.
(Ord. No. O-03-0008, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-08-0020, Amended 08/14/2008; Ord. No. O-2017-0005, Amended 02/28/2017)
19-7-3. General Provisions Applicable to Parking Enforcement and Towing Companies.
A. A person conducting towing or parking enforcement operations shall furnish without charge an itemized
statement of services performed, labor and special equipment used in completing a tow or boot of a vehicle,
and the charges made therefore to and upon the request of:
1. The person requesting the towing or booting service; or
2. The owner of the vehicle towed or booted; or
3. The duly authorized agent of either of the foregoing.
(Ord. No. O-03-0008, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-08-0020, Amended 08/14/2008)
B. Parking enforcement and towing companies shall post a copy of a schedule of fees in a prominent place at the
business location where vehicles are released from storage. Upon request, a parking enforcement or towing
company shall show a current copy of its fee schedule to a person whose vehicle is being towed or booted and
shall provide the name and phone number of the owner or agent of the property from or on which the vehicle
is being or has been towed or booted.
(Ord. No. O-03-0008, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-08-0020, Amended 08/14/2008)
C. Parking enforcement and towing companies shall maintain personnel authorized to release any vehicle to its
owner twenty-four (24) hours each day. A vehicle shall be released immediately upon payment of any
required fees authorized by this Article.
(Ord. No. O-03-0008, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-08-0020, Amended 08/14/2008)
D. Towing and parking enforcement companies, including those that are not on the rotation list, are required to
comply with this Article. Failure to comply with the applicable portions of this Article may result in the
revocation of a parking enforcement and towing company’s business license or its right to conduct towing and
parking enforcement within the City.
(Ord. No. O-2012-0009, Enacted, 03/27/2012)
E. Revocation of Towing or Parking Enforcement License or Registration.
If after conducting an investigation, the Chief of Police or his designee determines that a violation of this Article,
Section 12-5-13, or state law has occurred, the parking enforcement or towing company will have ten (10) days to
remedy the violation. If the parking enforcement or towing company fails to do so, the Chief of Police or his
designee may revoke the towing or parking enforcement company’s business license or registration pursuant to
Subsection 3 of this Section.
1. In addition to the violations contained in Article 12-4 and Section 12-5-13.H., a towing or parking
enforcement company may have its business license or registration revoked if any of the following occurs:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 517
a. A towing or parking enforcement company fails to comply with any of the requirements of this Article;
b. A towing or parking enforcement company fails to comply with Section 12-5-13;
c. A towing or parking enforcement company fails to comply with applicable state law;
d. A judicial determination is made that a parking enforcement or towing company has conducted a tow
not in compliance with this Article, Section 12-5-13, or applicable state law; or
e. A parking enforcement or towing company fails to refund to the vehicle owner all nonadministrative
fees and costs imposed after a finding by a court or the Chief of Police that a tow or booting did not
comply with this Article, Section 12-5-13, or state law.
2. The Chief of Police or his designee shall hear and determine all revocations.
a. No business license or registration shall be revoked until a show-cause hearing has been held. Written
notice of such hearing shall be served at least ten (10) working days prior to the date thereof upon the
parking enforcement or towing company or its agent. Such notice shall state the grounds for
revocation and the time and place the hearing will be held. The parking enforcement or towing
company shall have the right to appear and respond to any allegations made and to present reasons
why the business license or registration should not be revoked.
b. Show-cause hearings shall be conducted informally. Witnesses may be sworn, although it is not
necessary. Formal rules of evidence and court procedure shall not apply. Because the hearings are
administrative in nature, hearsay is admissible, but evidence must have some probative weight and
reliability. The standard of proof shall be a preponderance of the evidence.
3. Appeal. Any parking enforcement or towing company that has had its business license or registration
revoked pursuant to this Article may appeal to the City Manager the decision of the Chief of Police or his
designee’s decision to revoke. Any appeal must be in writing and filed with the City Manager or his
designee within ten (10) days of receiving a notice of the revocation. Within ten (10) days of receiving a
notice of appeal, the City Manager or his designee shall render a decision upholding the revocation or
reinstating the parking enforcement or towing company’s business license or registration.
4. Reinstatement after Revocation. In order for a parking enforcement or towing company that has had its
business license or registration revoked pursuant to this Article to be reinstated absent a successful appeal
to the City Manager, the towing or parking enforcement company must:
a. Reapply for a new license or registration; and
b. Must satisfactorily demonstrate to the Chief of Police or his designee that the violation of the
ordinance that resulted in the revocation has been remedied.
(Ord. No. O-2012-0009, Enacted, 03/27/2012; Ord. No. O-2017-0005, Amended 02/28/2017)
19-7-4. Rotation List.
A. Creation. The Chief of Police or his designee shall create and administer a rotation list comprised of those
towing companies who comply with all the terms of this Article and Section 12-5-13 of the Orem City Code
and are authorized to respond to calls for service by the Police Department. One slot on the rotation list shall
be given to each compliant company. To ensure a fair distribution of calls for service, however, companies
with different names but which utilize the same employees, trucks, business offices or impound yards shall be
treated as one company for purposes of the rotation list, and shall only have one slot on the list.
(Ord. No. O-03-0008, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-08-0020, Amended 08/14/2008; Ord. No. O-2010-0010, Amended 05/11/2010;
Ord. No. O-2017-0005, Amended 02/28/2017)
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 518
B. Duties of companies on list. In addition to any other requirements set forth in the Orem City Code or required
by federal or state law, a towing company, which has been placed on the rotation list, shall:
1. Respond to a call for service from the Police Department and arrive on scene within fifteen (15) minutes of
receiving the call. In the event that the company fails to arrive within fifteen (15) minutes from receipt of
the call, the Police Department shall be permitted to secure the services of an alternate company from the
rotation list. The late-responding company shall not be entitled to any fee for a late response or costs and
expenses incurred as a result thereof. Any company that fails to respond within the required fifteen (15)
minutes will be placed at the bottom of the rotation list. Only those tow truck companies that have been
called from the rotation list may respond to a public safety request. Towing companies that have not been
specifically called may not respond on behalf of another tow truck company, regardless of the
circumstances. Responding tow truck companies that have not been called, shall be placed on the bottom
of the rotation list.
2. Have a vehicle storage facility within the City corporate limits that has a fenced area, enclosed yard, or
building. No vehicle may be moved to a location which is not within the City limits without the prior
consent of the owner or operator of the vehicle. Such vehicle storage facility must comply with all state
requirements.
3. Have the capability of transporting abandoned or inoperable vehicles.
4. Clean up any mess, debris, rubble or any other items that may be located on the roadway or in the
immediate vicinity of the location from which an abandoned or inoperable vehicle is to be towed. To
achieve this requirement, and in addition to any other state or administrative requirements, the tow truck
must be equipped with adequate equipment and materials to clean up the area. Failure to clean up the
area is a violation of this Section and can result in being removed from the rotation list.
5. Ensure that all its authorized agents agree to follow the instructions or orders of a public safety officer at
the towing scene.
6. Comply with all federal, state, and local requirements governing parking enforcement and towing
companies.

removal shall be the later of ten (10) days after the Chief of Police or his designee sends a Notice of Removal

his designee to be placed back on the list no sooner than ten days prior to the expiration of the removal
period. The Chief of Police shall place the company back on the towing rotation list upon a showing that all
previous problems for which the company has been removed have been corrected, and the company certifies
it is willing and able to comply with all the requirements for being on the rotation list.

visitor parking spaces, if any, shall be clearly marked to give notice that parking is prohibited or otherwise
restricted in a particular area.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 520
(Ord. No. O-03-0008, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-08-0020, Ren&Amd 08/14/2008)
B. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to boot or tow away a motor vehicle on or from

owner or his agent or a police officer or a person acting on behalf of a law enforcement agency.
(Ord. No. O-03-0008, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-08-0020, Ren&Amd 08/14/2008)
C. Except for tow truck service that was ordered by a peace officer or a person acting on behalf of a law
enforcement agency, the tow truck operator shall:
1. Contact the Orem Department of Public Safety dispatch center prior to towing or booting the vehicle and

c. reasons for the removal or booting of the vehicle;
d. person who requested the removal or booting of the vehicle;

vehicle storage facility before towing another vehicle ; and
3. Within two business days of performing the tow truck services send a certified letter to the registered

vehicle, if applicable, obtained from the Motor Vehicle Division, notifying the owner of the:
a. location of the vehicle;
b. date, time and location from which the vehicle was removed;
c. reasons for the removal of the vehicle;
d. person who requested the removal of the vehicle;
e. vehicle’s description, including its vehicle identification number and license number or other
identification number issued by a state agency; and
f. costs and procedures to retrieve the vehicle.

D. It shall be unlawful to boot or tow a motor vehicle in or from a private parking lot having four (4) or more
parking spaces that are open to the public, other than a vehicle which has been continuously parked on the
private parking lot for more than forty-eight (48) hours, unless a clearly visible and conspicuous sign posted
on, or immediately adjacent to the property provides notice that unauthorized vehicles will be booted or
towed from the parking lot. Such signs shall:
1. Be at least eighteen inches (18") by twenty-four inches (24") in size;
2. Give warning, in large reflective lettering, that unauthorized vehicles or illegally parked vehicles will be
booted or towed;
3. Give the name and telephone number of the firm(s) authorized to boot or tow vehicles;

City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 521
5. Except otherwise exempted below, be posted within approximately five feet (5') of every entrance to a
parking lot.
a. For purposes of this subsection, a parking lot entrance shall mean any access allowing the entrance or
exit of a vehicle between a private parking lot and a city street unless such access is not the property of
the parking lot owner. In such case, the parking lot entrance shall mean:
i. The intersection of the parking lot property line and the property line of the access point; or
ii. Any privately owned road connected to a public right-of-way leading to the entrance of a parking
lot located on private property.
b. A sign posted directly over a driveway leading to an underground lot shall be deemed to meet the
location requirements of this subsection.
c. If signs cannot be posted within five feet (5') from the entrance to a parking lot for reasons of practical
difficulty (such as the necessity of drilling a hole through concrete, removing a tree or shrubs,
conflicting with the clear vision area, or because of an immediately adjacent private driveway not
owned by the owner of the parking lot, etc.), a sign may be placed as close as reasonably practicable to
the parking lot entrance. However, no sign shall be further than thirty feet (30') unless the property
owner or his agent has consulted with the Police Department to ensure placement of signs in
alternative locations that will meet the purpose of this Section.
6. Be posted at least four (4) feet and no more than seven (7) feet above the ground.

The objectives of this Chapter are:
A. To prevent the introduction into the POTW wastewater system of pollutants which will interfere with the
operation of the system or contaminate the resulting biosolids;
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-92-023, Amended, 10/27/92; Ord. No. O-06-0009, Amended 5/23/06)
B. To prevent the introduction into the POTW wastewater system of pollutants which will pass through the
system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or which would be incompatible with
the system;
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-92-023, Amended, 10/27/92; Ord. No. O-06-0009, Amended 5/23/06)

E. To provide for and promote the general health, safety and welfare of the citizens residing within the POTW
service area.
The provisions herein provide for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the POTW wastewater
system through the issuance of permits and through enforcement of general requirements for all users. They
authorize monitoring and enforcement activities, require user reporting, assume that existing users' capability
will not be preempted, and provide for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from
the program established herein.
The provisions herein shall apply to the POTW, users of the POTW, and any person or entity otherwise
regulated by this Chapter.

City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 552
A. Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in
the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the POTW
Manager a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by
the pretreatment standards. This report shall be submitted during the months of April and October for the
respective preceding six month period, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by
the POTW Manager. In addition, the report shall include a record of all daily flows during the reporting period.
At the discretion of the POTW Manager and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, etc., the POTW Manager may alter the months during which the above reports are to
be submitted.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90)
B. The POTW Manager may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are
appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subparagraph (A) of this Section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or
production and mass where requested by the POTW Manager, of pollutants contained therein which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the
applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established
by the EPA Administrator pursuant to Section 304 (h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and
amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved by techniques approved by the EPA
Administrator.

City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 553
shall be submitted to the POTW for review, and shall be approved by the POTW before construction of the
facility. No industrial user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date hereof shall be
permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved
by the POTW. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user
from the responsibility to modify the industrial user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements hereof. In
the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and
notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, the type of waste,
the concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-92-023, Amended, 10/27/92)
B. Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the
POTW Manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken
by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW,
fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of
any fines civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this Chapter or any other applicable law.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-92-023, Amended, 10/27/92)
C. Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other

operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Such facilities required by the POTW may include the
requirement for separate systems to handle sanitary and industrial wastewater so that both can be discharged
into the POTW collection system independently of each other. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the POTW for review, and shall be approved in writing by the
POTW Manager before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent
acceptable to the POTW under the provisions hereof. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
methods of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the POTW prior to the user's initiation of the
changes.
The POTW shall annually publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the boundaries of the POTW, a list
of the users in significant non-compliance (SNC) during the twelve (12) previous months. The notification shall
also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user during the same twelve (12) months. All records
relating to compliance with pretreatment shall be made available to officials of the EPA or Approval Authority
upon request.

Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or to governmental agencies without
restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW
Manager that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
When requested by the user furnishing a report, the portion of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related thereto.
Information accepted by the POTW as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency by the
POTW without first providing ten (10) days written notice to the user by certified mail or personal service.

(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90)
20-8-4. Consent Orders.
The Director may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such
documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 20-8-5
and 20-8-6 of this ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-92-023, Rep,&ReEn, 10/27/92)
20-8-5. Compliance Orders.
When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance
within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-92-023, Rep,&ReEn, 10/27/92)
20-8-6. Cease and Desist Orders.
When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-92-023, Ren,&Amd, 10/27/92, 20-8-8)
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or
threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.

20-8-7. Administrative Fines.
A. When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
the Director may fine such user in an amount not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall
be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge
limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-92-023, Rep,&ReEn, 10/27/92)
B. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Director to reconsider the fine along
with full payment of the fine amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the Director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the
payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Director may add the
costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
C. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the user.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/90; Ord. No. O-92-023, Rep,&ReEn, 10/27/92)
20-8-8. Emergency Suspensions.
The Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge
that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment
to the environment. If time and circumstances permit, the Director shall attempt to give the user notice of the
suspension and an opportunity to be heard before the suspension takes effect.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the
event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director may take

The following land management strategies and regulations apply to existing and new uses and activities within a
designated DWSP Zone.
A. Pollution Sources and Potential Contamination Sources. In DWSP Zones that allow pollution sources and
potential contamination sources subject to the implementation of appropriate land management strategies
and/or a Management Plan, the following regulations shall apply:
1. Storage Containers. All regulated pollution sources, potential contamination sources, and regulated
substances shall be stored in suitable containers to reduce the chance for the substances to be
accidentally introduced into the environment. These storage containers shall be product-tight and, except
where provided elsewhere in this ordinance, shall be provided with a means to control spillage (primary
containment) and to contain or drain off spillage and fire-protection water discharged in the storage area
(secondary containment). Storage containers, which are stored outside, must be covered or mounted to
prevent the accumulation of rain or other water on the top of the container, or the degradation of the top,
sides or bottom of the container, in a manner that would lead to the reduction of the integrity of the
container. Defective storage containers shall be removed from service for repair or disposal in accordance
with local, state and federal standards.
2. Secondary Containment. Where secondary containment is required, it shall be constructed of a material
of sufficient structural integrity and composition to contain the required capacity of liquids and not be
structurally weakened as a result of contact with the discharge of the regulated substance to be
contained. The material shall be free of cracks, joints, gaps, or other imperfections, which would allow
leakage through the containment material.
a. Capacity. The secondary containment system shall have sufficient capacity to contain (1) 10 percent of
the volume of all the containers and 100 percent of the volume of the largest single container,
whichever is greater, plus (2) the design flow rate of the automatic fire extinguishing system (for 20
minutes) for the area or room in which the storage is located. If the storage area and /or containment
area are open to rainfall, the secondary containment system must also accommodate the volume of a
24-hour rainfall as determined by a 25-year storm frequency. Liquid that accumulates in the secondary
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 587
containment system shall be removed in a timely a manner as necessary to prevent overflow of the
system. Nonhazardous liquids may be drained in accordance with applicable regulations. If the
collected material is a hazardous waste under Title 40 party 261 of the Code of Federal Regulations, it
must be managed as a hazardous waste in accordance with all applicable requirement of Parts 262
through 266 of that regulation.
b. Containment Devices and Materials. Vacuum suction devices, absorbent scavenger materials or other
devices approved by the Management Plan, shall be present on-site or available to facilitate the
removal or further containment of spilled regulated substances. Devices or materials shall be available
in sufficient magnitude so as to at least control and collect the total quantity of regulated substances
that the containment system is designed to contain. Emergency containers shall be present and of
such capacity as to hold the total quantity of regulated substances plus absorbent material.
3. Emergency Management Plan. An emergency management plan shall be prepared and filed with the DRC,
the Police Department, and the PWS indicating the procedures that will be followed by a regulated person
in the event of the release of a pollution source, potential contamination source, or regulated substance
from the person’s property. The emergency management plan shall be designed to control and collect all
such spilled material in such a manner as to prevent it from discharging into any storm or sanitary drains
or the ground. Facilities which have had, or appear to have had, unauthorized discharges to soil or
groundwater may be required by the City to submit a Regulated Substances Management Plan for the
facility. The written Plan will be used to demonstrate to the City that the facility owner or operator
understands the procedures and has the proper equipment to handle regulated substances within the
guidelines of this Ordinance. The Plan §21-2-7 WATER City of Orem 21.16 should not be implemented
without the approval of the City.
4. Reporting of Spills. Any spill of a regulated pollution source, potential contamination source, or a
regulated substance in excess of the nonaggregate quantity thresholds established by the List of
Hazardous Waste (40 CFR part 261), Subpart D), 40 CFR Appendix VIII-Hazardous Constituents and EPA
Designations Reportable Quantities and Notification Requirements for Hazardous Substances under
CERCLA (40 CFR 302, effective July 3, 1986), shall be reported by telephone to the City within 1 hour of
discovery of the spill. Cleanup shall commence immediately upon discovery of the spill. A full written
report shall be submitted to the City within 15 days of discovery of the spill.
(Ord. No. O-03-0009, Enacted, 04/01/2003; Ord. No. O-2017-0005, Amended 02/28/2017)
B. Best Management Practices. All potential contamination sources within a DWSP Zone shall incorporate and
utilize Best Management practices (BMPs) in their operations. BMPs that reduce the potential for spills and
leaks at a site to occur and enter groundwater shall be construed within the context of this Ordinance to
include, but not be limited to, structural and nonstructural practices, conservation practices, and operation
and maintenance procedures as specified by the DRC, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality and the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
(Ord. No. O-03-0009, Enacted, 04/01/2003)

for their wellheads. Such drinking water source protection zones may extend into City of Orem boundaries. If
another public water system has a DWSP Plan approved by the State of Utah, and if such public water system is
willing to acknowledge and protect Orem’s DWSP zones, then the Orem City Manager may enter into an
agreement with such water system providing for the reciprocal acknowledgment and protection of each other’s
DWSP zones. Upon execution of such an agreement, Orem may regulate development and property usage within
the other public water system’s drinking water source protection zones located in Orem in the same manner that
it may regulate development and property usage within its own drinking water source protection zones, and all
provisions and requirements of this ordinance shall apply equally to the other public water system’s drinking
water source protection zones located in Orem.
(Ord. No. O-03-0009, Enacted, 04/01/2003)
21-2-8. Development and Management Plan Approval.
Any person desiring to (1) develop undeveloped property within a DWSP Zone, or (2) expand an existing structure
or facility within a DWSP Zone, or (3) change the use of any real property within a DWSP Zone, or (4) engage in an
activity that is restricted by a given DWSP Zone, shall submit a Management Plan to the City. No Management
Plan will be required if the proposed development, use or activity is not restricted or prohibited by this Ordinance.
A. Content of Management Plan. The Management Plan shall incorporate land management strategies and Best
Management Practices designed to manage existing contaminant sources and to protect the groundwater
from any type of potential contamination. The City will work with an applicant in developing an appropriate
Management Plan for a given site.
(Ord. No. O-03-0009, Enacted, 04/01/2003)
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 589
B. Review and Approval of Management Plan by DRC. The DRC shall review all new developments and changes
to existing developments to determine if they comply with the requirements of this Ordinance. The DRC shall
also review all Management Plans to determine if they comply with the requirements of this ordinance.
(Ord. No. O-03-0009, Enacted, 04/01/2003)
C. Restriction on Development, Uses, and Activities without DRC Approval. No site plan, conditional use permit,
building permit or subdivision plat shall be approved by the City unless the DRC determines that the
development of the property, the uses of the property, and the activities on the property comply with the
requirements of this ordinance, including the approval of any required Management Plan. The DRC may reject
any Management Plan failing to meet the requirements of this Ordinance.
(Ord. No. O-03-0009, Enacted, 04/01/2003)
21-2-9. Enforcement.

D. Justification. A conditional use permit may be amended at the request of the holder of the permit upon a
showing of good cause. A conditional use permit may be amended or revoked at the request of any other
interested party if the City Council finds one or more of the following:
1. That the conditional use permit was obtained by misrepresentation or fraud.
2. That the use for which the permit was granted has ceased or has been suspended for six months.
3. That the holder or user of the conditional use permit has failed to comply with any of the conditions
placed on the issuance of the permit.
4. That the holder or user of the conditional use permit has failed to comply with any City, State or Federal
law governing the conduct of the use.
5. That the holder or user of the conditional use permit has failed to construct or maintain the site as shown
on the approved site plan.

(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended 06/12/2001)

the permit without first giving him or her an opportunity to appear before the City Council and show cause as
to why the permit should not be amended or revoked. Amendment or revocation of the permit shall not limit
the City's ability to initiate or complete other legal proceedings against the holder or user of the permit.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord No. O-01-0021, Amended 06/12/2001)

A. The location and boundaries of each of the zones are established as shown on the map entitled "Zoning Map
of the City of Orem, Utah," and all boundaries, notations and other data shown thereon are as much a part of
this Chapter as if fully described herein.

1. Where the indicated boundaries on the zone map are approximate street or alley lines, said streets or
alleys shall be construed to be the zone boundaries.
2. Where the indicated boundaries are approximate lot lines, said lot lines shall be construed to be the zone
boundaries unless otherwise indicated.
3. Where land has not been subdivided into lots and blocks, the zone boundaries shall be determined by use
of the scale of measurement shown on the map.

facility for disabled persons (SLU Code 1261) in a residential or Highway Services zone if the applicant meets
the following requirements:
1. The facility conforms to all applicable standards and requirements of the Utah State Department of
Human Services and the owner/operator has obtained all licenses required by the State to operate such a
facility.
2. The facility conforms to all State and local building, safety, health, and zoning requirements applicable to
similar structures.
3. The facility is operated for the primary purpose of providing a living arrangement for disabled individuals
in a group home setting.
4. The facility is occupied only by individuals with a disability and paid, professional staff members.
Occupancy by any staff member shall only be allowed if such occupancy is primarily for the purpose of
serving the disabled individuals and not primarily a benefit of employment to the staff member. The
facility shall not house more than eight disabled individuals.
5. Residency in the facility shall be on a strictly voluntary basis and not a part of, or in lieu of, confinement,
rehabilitation, or treatment in a correctional facility. A residential facility for disabled persons shall not
include any persons referred by the Utah State Department of Corrections or any adult or juvenile court.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 637
6. No individual who has impairment due to addiction to any controlled substance or alcohol, and currently
uses such controlled substance or alcohol, will be a resident.
7. At least three off-street parking stalls are provided to serve the needs of residents, visitors, and staff
members.
8. A residential facility for disabled persons located in an existing residential dwelling shall be capable of use
as a residential facility for disabled persons without structural or landscaping alterations that would
change the structure’s residential character. Any new structure constructed for use as a residential facility
for disabled persons shall be of a size, scale, and design that is in harmony with other residential uses in
the vicinity.
9. No person convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance shall be an
occupant in a residential facility for disabled persons.
10. The facility shall not be made available to or occupied by any individual whose tenancy would constitute a
direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial
physical damage to the property of others. The owner or operator of a residential facility for disabled
persons shall conduct an individualized assessment of each person who desires to become a resident of
the facility to determine if such person would constitute a direct threat prior to allowing occupancy of the
facility by such person. The assessment shall consider any prior criminal or violent acts of each individual,
the amount of time that has elapsed since the commission of any such acts, and the treatment or
medication received by the individual that may have eliminated the direct threat. In the case of any
resident or potential resident who has committed an offense requiring registration with any sex offender
registry, the individualized assessment shall include a psycho-sexual evaluation of such person performed
by a duly licensed psychiatrist or an individual holding a PhD in psychology. The owner or operator of the
facility shall be responsible to determine whether any resident or potential resident has been convicted of
an offense requiring registration with any sex offender registry. Prior to the occupancy of any facility and
at least quarterly thereafter, the person or entity licensed or certified by the applicable regulatory state
agency shall certify in a sworn affidavit to the City that based on the individualized assessment performed
for each resident, no person will or does reside in the facility whose tenancy would likely constitute a
direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial
physical damage to the property of others.
11. The applicant for a permit provides sufficient documentation and other evidence reasonably required by
the City to establish compliance with all of the above criteria.
12. Upon application by a current or prospective owner, operator or resident of a residential facility for
disabled persons, the City Manager or his designee may grant a reasonable accommodation from any of
the requirements of this section as may be required by the provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act
of 1988, 42 U.S.C., Section 3601 et. seq.
Any permit issued pursuant to this Section shall be nontransferable and shall terminate if the structure is devoted
to a use other than a residential facility for disabled persons or the structure fails to comply with all building,
safety, health, and zoning requirements of the Orem City Code applicable to similar structures. Violation of the
requirements listed above shall be grounds for terminating the permit and the owner/operator shall thereafter be
required to discontinue the use of the premises as a residential facility for disabled persons.

and of providing documentation to the City to prove that the person qualifies as an owner under this
section.

existing structure shall use existing entrances on any side of the structure that faces a street. The purpose
of this requirement is to preserve the single-family residential look of the building.

(Ord. No. O-2010-0027, Enacted 11/09/2010)
K. Amateur Radio. This section shall apply to amateur radio (“ham radio”) antennas and support structures.
1. General Regulations. Amateur radio antennas and support structures are allowed as a permitted use in all
zones up to a height of forty-five (45) feet. All amateur radio antennas and support structures shall comply
with the following requirements.
a. All facilities shall comply with any pertinent regulations of the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
b. A building permit is required for any support structure over twelve (12) feet in height.
c. No more than one amateur support structure per lot may be installed. A support structure may only be
located in the rear or side yard of a home or primary structure. A roof-mounted antenna shall be
allowed provided that the height of the antenna does not exceed twelve (12) feet.
d. Setbacks for all amateur radio support structures shall be at least twenty feet (20’) from neighboring
property lines and a minimum of thirty feet (30’) from any public right of way.
e. A support structure shall be composed of nonreflective galvanized steel or aluminum and shall be a
neutral color or a color to match the background against which it will be most commonly seen.
f. Antennas are to be installed on a building or property in the least conspicuous location possible.
g. A support structure in a residential zone may not make use of guy wires.
2. Conditional Use for Additional Height. A conditional use permit may be granted by the City Council to
allow amateur radio antennas and support structures to exceed 45 feet in height if it finds that the
additional height will not create any negative impact or that the adverse negative impacts of such facilities
at a greater height can be substantially mitigated. It is the intent of the City to reasonably accommodate
antennas and support structures to the greatest extent practicable without negatively impacting the
aesthetic quality of the neighborhood in which they are located. Antennas and support structures will
generally not be allowed at a greater height to the extent the greater height negatively impacts the
aesthetics of the neighborhood in which they are located. In determining whether amateur radio antennas
and support structures should be allowed to exceed 45 feet in height, the City Council shall consider the
following factors:
a. The potential negative impact that the structure will have on the views of properties in the
neighborhood. Special consideration shall be given to the impact on the views of attractive natural
features such as Mount Timpanogos, Cascade Mountain, and Utah Lake.
b. The potential negative impact that the structure will have on the overall aesthetic quality of the
neighborhood in which the structure is located.
c. The potential impact the structure may have on property values in the neighborhood in which the
structure is located.
d. The need of the owner/operator for an antenna and support structure in excess of 45 feet.
e. The extent to which any negative impacts of the structure can be mitigated. Factors that may reduce
the negative impact that a structure will have on the aesthetic quality of a neighborhood and which
may be made a condition(s) for the allowance of a height greater than 45 feet include but are not
limited to the following:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 656
(1) Setbacks from adjoining property that significantly exceed the required setbacks listed in
subsection (1)(d) above.
(2) The current existence and use of trees or other means to screen or camouflage the structure.
(3) The use of a retractable support structure which is retracted when not in use or which is fully
extended only during limited hours.
(4) The location of a support structure adjacent to land that is undeveloped and not likely to be
developed due to topography or other characteristics.
(5) The location of a support structure in or adjacent to commercial property, churches, schools, parks
or similar property such that the support structure will not impair the views of residential property
owners.
(6) Any other factor that could reasonably mitigate the negative impact of the structure.
The existence of one or more of the conditions listed above does not create a presumption that the negative
impacts of an antenna or antenna support structure are adequately mitigated.
3. Abandonment. An antenna structure shall be deemed to be abandoned and must be removed if the
antenna is not used for a period of two (2) years or more. However, this two year period shall not run
during any time when the owner is away on a temporary leave of absence due to military service, a
volunteer service assignment or ecclesiastical assignment.
(Ord. No. O-2011-0006, Enacted 03/08/2011)

to avoid problems that may otherwise be associated with beekeeping in populated areas.
3. Certain Conduct Unlawful: Notwithstanding compliance with the various requirements of this article, it
shall be unlawful for any person to maintain an apiary or to keep any colony on any property in a manner
that threatens public health or safety or creates a nuisance. Furthermore, it is a violation of this ordinance
to maintain an apiary or keep any colony that constitutes a nuisance due to its impact on the
neighborhood. For the purposes of this section, a colony or apiary constitutes a nuisance when:
a. the honeybees travel to any neighboring property to such an extent that the residents of that property
are unable to fully enjoy the use of their property without coming into conflict with honeybees; or
b. there is a resident on adjacent property who has a known allergy to bee stings.
4. Hives on Residential Lots:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 657

ground, as measured from the ground to the lowest portion of the hive.
c. Hives shall be operated and maintained as provided in the Utah Bee Inspection Act, Title 4, CHAPTER
11 of the Utah Code (1953 as amended).
d. Each hive shall be conspicuously marked with the owner’s name, address, telephone number, and
state registration number.
8. Flyways:
a. A hive shall be placed on property so that the general flight pattern of the honeybees is in a direction
that will deter honeybee contact with humans and domesticated animals.
(1) If any portion of a hive is within twenty-five (25) feet from an adjacent property line or public
access point as measured from the nearest point on the hive to the property line, a flyway barrier
at least six (6) feet in height shall be established and maintained around the hive except as needed
to allow access.
(2) Such flyway shall consist of a solid wall, a fence, dense vegetation, or a combination thereof, and
must extend at least ten (10) feet beyond the hive in each direction so that honeybees are forced
to fly to an elevation of at least six (6) feet above ground level over property lines in the vicinity of
the apiary.
(3) Such flyway may not violate any other provision in CHAPTER 22 of the Orem City Code.
9. Water: Each beekeeper shall ensure that a convenient source of water is available to the colony
continuously between March 1 and October 31 of each year. The water shall be in a location that
minimizes any nuisance created by honeybees seeking water on neighboring property.
10. Beekeeping Equipment: Each beekeeper shall ensure that no bee comb or other beekeeping equipment is
left upon the grounds of an apiary site. Upon removal from a hive, all such equipment shall promptly be
disposed of in a sealed container or placed within a building or other bee-proof enclosure.
11. Violation and Penalty: The keeping of honeybees in violation of this ordinance is prohibited. Any violation
of this section shall be a criminal misdemeanor pursuant to Orem City Code Section 22-1-6 and subject to
the provisions of Orem City Code Section 22-1-3.

M. Historical Barns and Sheds on Residential Lots. In an effort to preserve barns and sheds that are a part of
Orem’s historical heritage, a barn or shed built before 1940 (hereinafter referred to as an “historical barn or
shed”) that was used in conjunction with fruit farming and that becomes nonconforming due to the

restoration of an historical wall sign that is painted on the barn or shed where the sign is more than fifty
years old.
5. The historical shed or barn shall be removed before any residential dwelling may be built on the lot.
6. When a residential lot is created that contains an historical barn or shed, all other requirements for
subdivided residential lots shall be required and enforced.
7. Any animals on the lot shall meet the requirements of Section 22-6-10C.
8. The minimum size of the shed or barn must be at least 150 square feet.
9. The historical shed or barn shall be maintained and preserved so as to be safe for current use. The roof
shall be maintained and repaired so as to maintain a dry interior.
10. The owner of the lot shall demolish the shed or barn and remove all evidence of the shed or barn if the
building is determined to be unsafe by the Chief Building Official of Orem as outlined in the “The Uniform

22-7-1. Title.
The ordinance contained in Article 22-7 shall be known as the "Planned Residential Development Ordinance" or
"PRD Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-97-0040, Rep&ReEn, 08/12/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
22-7-2. Purpose.
A. The purpose of the PRD Ordinance is to create diverse and quality housing in the City of Orem.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-97-0040, Rep&ReEn, 08/12/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
B. The purpose of the PRD Ordinance is accomplished by:
1. Allowing densities higher than a typical residential development;
2. Establishing standards for landscaping, building and site design, public safety, parking, aesthetics, traffic
circulation, fencing, lighting, and other similar site improvements; and
3. Requiring standards that enable PRDs to fit into the surrounding neighborhoods.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-97-0040, Rep&ReEn, 08/12/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
22-7-3. Legislative Findings.
The City Council makes the following findings:
A. After consultation with homeowners' groups, housing industry representatives, and municipal officials, the
primary concerns with multifamily developments are related to residential density, design issues, and fitting in
with existing neighborhoods. The preference is for Orem to be predominantly a single-family community and
secondarily a multifamily community.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-92-011, Amended, 06/30/1992; Ord. No. O-97-0040, Rep&ReEn, 08/12/1997; Ord. No. O-
01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-03-0019, Amended, 06/24/2003)
B. Requiring standards for multifamily housing will help preserve the quality of housing in the future.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-97-0040, Rep&ReEn, 08/12/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001
C. Residents and local officials in Orem prefer to see multifamily housing dispersed throughout the City.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 660
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-97-0040, Rep&ReEn, 08/12/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No.
O-03-0019, Amended, 06/24/2003)
D. Although multifamily housing has enjoyed a strong market demand as an alternative to the traditional singlefamily
housing, additional standards for multifamily housing are necessary to ensure adequate light, air,
privacy, and open space for each dwelling unit, and to protect residents from the harmful effects of excessive
noise, population density, traffic congestion, and other adverse environmental effects.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-97-0040, Rep&ReEn, 08/12/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No.
O-03-0019, Amended, 06/24/2003)
E. Planned Residential Developments can contain both single-family and multifamily housing in the PRD zone as
long as strict standards require Planned Residential Developments to fit in with the surrounding
neighborhoods.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-97-0040, Rep&ReEn, 08/12/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No.
O-03-0019, Amended, 06/24/2003)
F. Planned Residential Developments should be at least one and one-half (1.5) acres in size to meet the intent of
the PRD Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-97-0040, Rep&ReEn, 08/12/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No.
O-03-0019, Amended, 06/24/2003)
22-7-4. Where Allowed, Types and Uses.
A. A Planned Residential Development, hereinafter referred to as a PRD, is a permitted use in the PRD zone and
is not permitted in any other zone.

B. Zone Development Standards for the State Street Corridor Area. The following requirements shall apply to all
development in the State Street Corridor Area including development in PD zones, unless the applicable PD
zone expressly states that the standards of the State Street Corridor Area do not apply. The “State Street
Corridor Area” refers to all lots that have frontage on State Street or frontage on a State Street Connector
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 677
Street (that portion of a public street that intersects with and is located within 500 feet of the State Street
right-of-way line). If not specifically governed by a provision of this Section 22-8-8(B), the “General Zone
Development Standards” of 22-8-8 (A) shall apply to development in the PO, C1, C2, C3, and HS zones.
1. Minimum and Maximum Setbacks From State Street and From State Street Connector Streets. All
buildings in the State Street Corridor Area shall be set back no more than ten feet (10’) from the back of
the required sidewalk (the side furthest from the street) along State Street and State Street Connector
Streets. There is no minimum setback from the State Street and State Street Connector Streets. Setbacks
from other streets and property lines shall be as set forth in 22-8-8(A). All area within a setback (the area
between the building and back of sidewalk) shall be landscaped and/or used as a "space open to the
public" in accordance with subsection (5).
2. Minimum Building Height. All primary buildings in the State Street Corridor Area shall have a minimum
building height of fifteen feet (15’).
3. Building Accesses. Buildings located on parcels that have frontage on State Street shall have at least one
public access facing State Street. Buildings on parcels that do not have frontage on State Street, but have
frontage on State Street Connector Streets shall have at least one public access facing the State Street
Connector Street. Building doors directly adjacent to sidewalks shall be recessed or otherwise set back so
that the door does not encroach into the sidewalk when opened.
4. Buffered Sidewalks. Buffered sidewalks shall be installed and maintained along the entire length of
property adjacent to State Street and State Street Connector Streets. Buffered sidewalks shall include both
a landscaped planter strip area with trees next to the street, and a sidewalk.
a. Planter Strips. Planter strips along State Street shall be at least fifteen feet (15’) wide and may not be
used for storm water detention or management (such as a low-impact development) (see Appendix
“SS”). Planter strips along State Street Connector Streets shall be at least eight feet (8’) wide and may
be used for storm water detention or management (such as a low impact development) (see Appendix
“SS”).
b. Sidewalks. Sidewalks along State Street and State Street Connector Streets shall be a minimum of 8
feet wide and shall include ADA-compliant ramps at curb cuts and intersections with public and private
streets. Landscaping such as tree grates and planter boxes may be incorporated into the required
sidewalk area where approved by the City, provided a continuous minimum unobstructed width of 5
feet of sidewalk travel lane is maintained. Sidewalk widths shall be consistent with sidewalks on
adjacent properties where possible (provided they also meet the 8-foot minimum width requirement),
or shall otherwise taper to meet neighboring sidewalk widths to create a smooth transition across
property lines.
c. Vegetation coverage. Landscaped areas shall have a minimum of 50% living vegetation coverage. No
vegetation coverage higher than 24 inches above grade shall be counted toward the total coverage
requirement. No landscaping shall be required at vehicle access points, and vehicular accesses do not
apply toward the total area required for vegetation coverage. Planter boxes, plants, and other
vegetation outside of required landscaping areas are encouraged, but do not apply toward the total
vegetation requirement.
d. Tree position and spacing. Trees shall be planted and maintained in the planter strips along State
Street and shall be spaced evenly one tree for every 40 linear feet (or fraction thereof) of landscaped
frontage. Trees shall be planted in the planter strips along State Street Connector Streets and shall be
spaced one tree for every 40 linear feet of landscaped frontage. Trees must be spaced to best align
with neighboring properties and to maximize the potential number of trees that can be planted. Trees
must also be planted in the planter strip no more than 4 feet in from the inside sidewalk edge.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 678
e. Tree species. Trees planted in the required planter strips along State Street and State Street Connector
Streets shall consist of trees authorized in Appendix “U”. (Note: specific tree species are listed for each
downtown district)
f. Accommodations for safety. Landscaping requirements may be modified where the City traffic
engineer determines a modification is necessary to accommodate deceleration lanes or to maintain
clear vision areas.
5. “Space open to the public” setback exception and height bonus: Maximum setbacks along State Street and
State Street Connector Streets may be extended an additional ten feet (for a total of 20 feet from back of
the required sidewalk) to accommodate outdoor dining areas or other spaces open to the public. See
Section 22-2-1 for the definition and requirements to qualify as a “Space open to the public”.Lots with
approved “spaces open to the public” may receive an additional maximum building height bonus of 15
feet (subject to applicable setback requirements in the C3 zone). Buildings with this added height must
remain set back from residentially-zoned properties a distance equal to the (new) height of the building.

landscaped area shall be provided. Landscaped areas shall be at least as wide as the required setback and be
maintained along the right-of-way line of dedicated streets, except as provided below:
1. Where a parcel is a corner lot, the total landscaping required shall be equal to the length of the property
(in feet) on the longer side adjacent to the street multiplied by the distance of the required setback. The
amount (in square feet) of landscaping required by this formula shall be distributed as follows: Landscaped
berms at least ten feet (10') in width shall be located adjacent to the right-of-way lines of both streets. The
balance of landscaping required by the formula may be placed anywhere else on the parcel and need not
be adjacent to a street.

developed in accordance with a detailed landscaping plan approved by the Planning Commission. In its
review, the Planning Commission shall consider the proposed location, number, size, and type of
plants, the type of irrigation system proposed, the plan's compliance with the Orem Tree Planting Plan,
and other similar factors. Frontage along arterial streets shall have landscaped berms at least as wide
as the required setback of the zone.
b. A five foot (5') strip may be allowed on streets other than arterial streets provided the strip is sloped
down to the public right-of-way from a concrete or concrete block retaining wall with a minimum
slope of 3:1 (three feet horizontal to one foot vertical) and is developed in accordance with a detailed
landscaping plan approved by the Planning Commission. In its review, the Planning Commission shall
consider the proposed location, number, size, and type of plants, the type of irrigation system
proposed, the plan's compliance with the Orem Tree Planting Plan, and other similar factors. Frontage
along arterial streets shall have landscaped berms at least as wide as the required setback of the zone.
3. No landscaping shall be required where vehicular accesses are permitted.
4. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, landscaping for the areas shown in Appendix TT of the

residential uses and to encourage development that will present a favorable image of the City from I-15. To
accomplish these objectives, the following additional standards and regulations shall apply to the HS Zone.
A. The minimum lot size in the zone shall be one acre. The purposes of this requirement are:
1. To encourage the development of large, well-planned projects designed to serve the area over a long
period of time, as opposed to small, hastily conceived projects that do little to add to the overall
appearance or economic vitality of the area.

corrugated metal are permitted for trim, soffits, fascia, mansards and similar architectural features. Standing
seam metal (but no other metals) may be used for awnings and awnings shall be counted toward the 20% area
limitation for the metals listed above. Finishing materials other than those listed as acceptable above may be
used if approved by the Planning Commission. In determining whether or not a particular finishing material is
acceptable, the Planning Commission shall consider the following factors :
1. The visibility of the site from I-15 and neighboring residential uses.
2. The degree to which the proposed finishing materials are compatible with the appearance of neighboring
residential uses.
3. The location of the proposed finishing materials on the building.

and maintained along the right-of-way line of dedicated streets, except as provided below:
1. Where a parcel is a corner lot, the total landscaping required shall be equal to the length of the property
(in feet) on the longer side adjacent to the street multiplied by the distance of the required setback. The
amount (in square feet) of landscaping required by this formula shall be distributed as follows: Bermed,
landscaped strips at least ten feet (10') in width shall be located on the right-of-way lines of both streets.
The balance of landscaping required by the formula may be placed elsewhere on the parcel in accordance
with an approved landscaping plan.

less than the required setback may be allowed as follows:
a. A ten foot (10') strip may be allowed on streets other than arterial streets, provided the strip is
developed in accordance with a detailed landscaping plan approved by the City. In its review, the City
shall consider the proposed location, number, size, and type of plants, the type of irrigation system
proposed, the plan's compliance with the Orem Tree Planting Plan, and other similar factors. Frontage
along arterial streets shall have landscape strips in width at least equal to the required setback of the
zone.
b. A five foot (5') strip may be allowed on streets other than arterial streets provided the strip is sloped
down to the public right-of-way from a concrete or concrete block retaining wall with a minimum

22-10-4. Clustered Development.
Except as provided in this Article, the development standards of the R20 Zone shall apply to developments within
the ROS zone. The minimum lot size in the ROS zone shall be one (1) acre and the minimum lot size in the OS5
zone shall be five (5) acres. However, land in the ROS zone and the OS5 zone may be developed with smaller lot
sizes (without increasing the allowed density) provided that the following standards are met:
A. Clustered Development. All residential lots and dwellings are clustered in a way that creates a consolidated
and contiguous area of open space.
(Ord. No. O-03-0031, Enacted, 07/01/2003)
B. Minimum Lot Size and Width. Each lot within the clustered development has:
At least 10,000 square feet;
At least 100 feet of lot frontage; and
Direct access to common open space.
(Ord. No. O-03-0031, Enacted, 07/01/2003)
C. Attached units. Attached units are not permitted.
(Ord. No. O-03-0031, Enacted, 07/01/2003)
D. Open Space in the ROS Zone. The required open space in the ROS zone shall meet the following
requirements:
1. The open space must be a part of a contiguous open area of at least five (5) acres, which may be located
on one or more parcels. The open space shall be integrated into the residential development and must
consist of large areas suitable for recreational uses. Open areas having any dimension of less than 40 feet
or other open areas that are not practically useable for recreational purposes because of their location,
size, dimensions or other characteristics shall generally not be considered as meeting the intent of the
open space requirement.
2. All open space areas shall be designated as “common area” on the preliminary and final plat with a note
indicating that such area(s) must be maintained as open space. Every lot owner in the subdivision shall
have an undivided and equal interest in the open space areas. The undivided interest in an open space
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 702
area may not be separated or sold separately from the ownership of each individual lot. Each lot owner is
responsible for an equal part of the taxes assessed on the open space areas. No subdivision or
development, except for recreational facilities, shall be allowed in any area designated as open space.
3. Prior to the approval of any final plat for a development, the owner/developer of a project shall establish a
nonprofit homeowners’ association, a trust or other similar mechanism acceptable to the City (hereinafter
collectively referred to as an “HOA”), which shall be formed for the purpose of assuming responsibility for
the ongoing maintenance of the open space areas. The owner/developer shall submit all documents
necessary for the establishment and function of the HOA to the City for review and approval prior to
receiving approval of any final plat. Such documents shall include provisions for the allocation of the costs
of open space maintenance between the lot owners, an effective means of enforcement and collection of
maintenance costs from the lot owners, and a provision that all property owners within the development
automatically become a member and/or participant in the HOA upon obtaining an ownership interest in
any lot in the development.
4. The owner/developer of a project shall be responsible for the initial development and installation of all
improvements required for the open space areas. The improvements to the open space areas (including
sprinkler systems and landscaping where applicable) shall be substantially completed no later than six (6)
months after the sale of thirty percent (30%) of the lots in the development. The owner/developer shall
also be responsible for the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of the open space areas until such time as at
least eighty percent (80%) of the lots in the development have been sold and the owner/developer has
transferred the responsibility for maintenance of the open space to the HOA. After the sale of eighty
percent (80%) of the lots in the development, the HOA shall be responsible for the maintenance of all
open space areas in conformance with the requirements of this Section 22-10-4 of the Orem City Code.
5. All open space must be maintained by the HOA as recreational uses such as parks, playgrounds, athletic
fields, pathways for pedestrians/bicyclists, and other similar uses for the common use and benefit of all of
the owners of the lots in the development and/or the public. The open space may be dedicated to the City
for use as a public park if the City is willing to accept the dedication. Primary buildings may not be
constructed in open space areas, but accessory buildings that are subordinate to and customarily
incidental to the primary recreational use (such as maintenance and equipment storage buildings) shall be
allowed. The open space areas must be maintained free of weeds and controlled in such a way as to
prevent the open spaces from becoming a nuisance.
6. If, for any reason the HOA ceases to exist or fails to maintain the open space areas as required, the lot
owners shall be equally responsible for such maintenance. If the HOA and/or the owners fail to maintain
the open space areas, the City shall have the right to enter upon the open space areas through its
employees or contractors to complete the maintenance. The expenses of providing the maintenance plus
a surcharge of thirty percent (30%) of the maintenance costs may be assessed against the lots in the
development and the City may file a lien against the lots to ensure payment of the costs and the
surcharge. Failure to maintain an open space area shall also be considered a violation of this Section 22-
10-4 and the City may institute criminal or civil proceedings to enforce the maintenance requirement.
7. Both the preliminary and final plat shall include the provisions of Subsections 22-10-4(D)(5) and (6) of the
Orem City Code as covenants, conditions and restrictions that shall be deemed to run with the land.
8. The owner/developer of a project shall be required to record with the office of the Utah County Recorder
a separate declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions which includes all of the provisions listed
in subsections 22-10-4(D)(2), (5) and (6) of the Orem City Code as covenants, conditions and restrictions.
The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions shall be made applicable to all property included
within the development.

9. The Planning Commission may deny a preliminary plat and the City Engineer may deny a final plat if the
open space shown on the plat does not comply with the provisions or intent of the open space
requirements described in this section.
(Ord. No. O-03-0031, Enacted, 07/01/2003)
E. Open Space in the OS5 zone. The required open space in the OS5 zone shall either comply with all of the open
space requirements of the ROS zone, or in the alternative shall comply with the following requirements:
1. The open space must be a part of a contiguous area of at least ten (10) acres, which may be located on
one or more parcels provided that each parcel is at least five (5) acres in size. The open space need not be
designated as common area and may be separately owned and sold apart from the ownership of the
separate residential lots. However, the required open space areas may not be subdivided into a parcel of
less than five (5) acres.
2. The open space areas may be used only for agricultural uses permitted in the OS5 zone or for
noncommercial recreational uses such as parks, playgrounds, athletic fields, pathways for
pedestrians/bicyclists, and other similar uses for the use and benefit of the owners of the lots in the
development and/or the public. No other use or development shall be allowed in any area designated as
open space.
3. Primary buildings may not be constructed in open space areas, but accessory buildings that are
subordinate to and customarily incidental to the primary agricultural or recreational use of the open space
shall be allowed.
4. The open space areas must be maintained free of weeds and controlled in such a way as to prevent the
open spaces from becoming a nuisance.
5. Both the preliminary and final plat(s) shall designate the areas to be kept as open space and shall include
the provisions of subsections 22-10-4(E)(2),(3) and (4) as covenants and restrictions that shall be deemed
to run with the land.
6. The owner/developer of a project shall be required to record with the office of the Utah County Recorder
a separate notice of covenants and restrictions stating that the property is subject to the provisions of
subsections 22-10-4(E)(2),(3) and (4) and that said covenants and restrictions run with the land.
(Ord. No. O-03-0031, Enacted, 07/01/2003)
F. Fencing Requirements. All required open space areas in the ROS zone and all residential lots located adjacent
to agricultural uses shall include a six-foot (6’) high fence along that portion of the property line in common
with the adjacent agricultural use.
(Ord. No. O-03-0031, Enacted, 07/01/2003)
22-10-5. Special Provisions.
A. The area around structures shall be kept free from refuse and debris, and all waste containers shall be
concealed from the view of adjacent property.

22-11-1. Purpose and Applicability.
1. The purpose of Planned Development (PD) zones is to provide flexibility in the City’s zoning scheme in order to
allow for unique, innovative and well-planned developments that would not be possible under one of the
City’s existing zoning classifications. PD zones are not intended for use in situations where a proposed
development is reasonably feasible under one of the City’s existing zoning classifications.
2. PD zones are intended for use primarily where no existing zoning classification is both sufficiently permissive
to allow uses that would be suitable on the property and sufficiently restrictive to protect the character and
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 706
quality of neighboring properties. Examples of this type of situation may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
a. Mixed-use developments;
b. Townhouse or other high-density residential developments;
c. Where a few uses in an existing zone (such as the C2 zone) would be appropriate on a particular parcel of
property, but the remainder of the uses in that zone would not be appropriate;
d. Where the setbacks, building height limits or other standards of an existing zone are not necessary for the
protection of neighboring properties or the general welfare of the City because of the proximity of a parcel
of property to a particular landscape feature such as a cliff or a hillside where there would be no negative
impact from a relaxation of such standards; and
e. Where additional setbacks or other buffers are needed to protect neighboring properties from uses to be
employed on a parcel of property.
3. The City Council finds that State Street, 800 North, Center Street and University Parkway are vital commercial
corridors within the City. Therefore, the City has conducted an intensive study and evaluation of State Street,
resulting in the adoption of the “State Street Corridor Master Plan” in 2015. This study has determined,
among other things, what types of uses are appropriate on State Street, ways to promote redevelopment
along State Street, ways to attract new business and enhance the economic viability of the State Street
corridor, the extent to which residential uses should be allowed on State Street, measures that can be taken
to enhance the visual appeal of State Street, and ways to enhance transportation, circulation, and walkability
of the area. Based on the outcome of the study, five new “State Street District” zones are planned for the
State Street Corridor Area, which will include permitted uses and design standards specifically tailored for
each district.
The City Council finds that it is in the best interest of the City to continue to not allow any new PD zones for
residential development along State Street, 800 North, Center Street and University Parkway pending the
outcome of further studies and the City Council’s evaluation of said studies. Therefore, effective February 5,
2014, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no new application will be accepted for the
creation of a PD zone that allows residential units within five hundred feet (500’) of State Street, 800 North,
Center Street or University Parkway.
Furthermore, based on the outcome of the State Street Corridor Master Plan, the City Council finds that it is in
the best interest of the City not to permit the creation of any new PD zones that allow residential uses on any
current residentially-zoned lot (namely the OS5, R20, R12, R8, R7.5, R6.5, R6, and R5 zones). Therefore,
effective July 1, 2018, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no new application will be
accepted for the creation of a PD zone that allows residential units on any current residentially-zoned lot
(namely the OS5, R20, R12, R8, R7.5, R6.5, R6, and R5 zones).
All aforementioned prohibitions shall remain in effect until modification of this section by the City Council.
However, the current intent of the City Council is that this prohibition will be temporary and the City Council
intends to reevaluate the appropriateness of residential PD zones along State Street, 800 North, Center Street
and University Parkway after further studies are conducted. Nothing herein shall prohibit the City Council from
considering and approving a PD zone allowing residential dwellings along State Street, 800 North, Center
Street or University Parkway where the application for the creation of such PD zone was received prior to
February 5, 2014.

22-11-2. General PD Zone Standards.
1. The “Zone Development Standards for the State Street Corridor Area” (22-8-8(B)) shall apply to all PD zones in
the State Street Corridor Area, unless otherwise expressly provided in a specific PD zone ordinance.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-05-0001, Amended, 01/11/2005; Ord. No. O-

22-11-3. Concept Plan.
A Concept Plan shall be submitted with every application to create a new PD zone. The Planning Commission shall
review the Concept Plan in conjunction with its review of the proposed PD zone and shall provide its
recommendation to the City Council. The City Council shall be the final approving authority for the Concept Plan.
The Concept Plan shall at a minimum include the following:
1. A layout of all parking areas, Amenities, open spaces, landscaped areas, drive accesses, proposed building
footprints, building heights and the orientation of all buildings;
2. Architectural renderings that illustrate the architectural style(s), materials, and designs to be employed in the
development;
3. The number of residential units per acre, if applicable;
4. The legal description of the subject property and a preliminary title report;
5. A topographic map of the subject property and adjacent property within three hundred feet (300') of the
subject property;
6. A tabulation of the total land area and percentage thereof designated for various proposed uses;
7. A general circulation plan indicating both public and private vehicular and pedestrian ways;
8. A statement indicating the future form of ownership (e.g. sole ownership, condominiums etc.) and
responsibility for maintenance of the project areas such as streets, structures and open spaces;
9. A preliminary plan for storm drainage, sewage disposal, grading and public utilities; and
10. Any additional information that the City may deem necessary to determine whether the proposed PD zone is
in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare.
The text of any particular PD zone may modify the requirements of the Concept Plan required for that specific PD
zone. All development in a PD zone shall conform to the Concept Plan.
(Ord. No. 661, Revised, 04/10/1990; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-05-0001, Amended, 01/11/2005)
22-11-4. Modification of Concept Plan.
An approved Concept Plan may be modified in the same manner as an amendment to the zoning ordinance.
However, the City Manager may (but shall not be obligated to) administratively approve minor modifications to a
Concept Plan. A modification may be considered minor if it does not:
1. Increase the density of residential units (if applicable) or change the approved uses;
2. Detract from the overall safety or aesthetics of the original Concept Plan;
3. Substantially alter the architecture or design characteristics of the original Concept Plan;
4. Create a greater adverse impact on neighboring properties than the original Concept Plan; and
5. Increase the proposed square footage of buildings by more than ten percent (10%).

22-11-6. Site Plan and Time for Development.
A site plan shall be required for all development in a PD zone unless the development consists of only singlefamily,
detached residential dwellings. The site plan shall conform to the approved Concept Plan. All site plans
shall comply with the provisions of Section 22-14-20. In the event that a site plan is not approved within two years
after application of a PD zone to a parcel of property, or in the event that substantial construction in harmony
with the site plan has not commenced within one (1) year from the date of the approval of the site plan, the City
may take action to change the zone back to its original or a different classification. Upon a finding of good cause,
the Planning Commission may grant an extension of up to one year for any of the deadlines contained in this
section.

3. Shrubs and Ground Cover. Liberal use of shrubs and ground cover plantings are encouraged throughout
the corridor. In particular, deciduous and annual plants that provide colors should be used to accent
entrances and street intersection nodes. However, landscaping shall not be placed next to streets in such a
way as to hamper sight distance, nor shall landscaping be placed along pedestrian walkways in such a way
as to jeopardize pedestrian safety. In order to achieve a "year round look" throughout the Corridor, a mix
of shrubs and ground cover shall be utilized as follows: 75% evergreen or broad leaf evergreen, 25%
deciduous.

property of others. The evaluation shall consider any prior criminal or violent acts of the individual that are
known to the person conducting the evaluation, the amount of time that has elapsed since the
commission of any such acts, and the treatment or medication received by the individual that may have
eliminated the direct threat. The evaluation shall also include a check of the U.S. Department of Justice
National Sex Offender Public Website (currently found at http://www.nsopw.gov/Core/Conditions.aspx),
to determine if the resident is listed as a sex offender. If the resident is a sex offender, the evaluation shall
include a psycho-sexual evaluation by a duly licensed psychiatrist or an individual holding a PhD in
psychology. If the evaluation determines that the client constitutes a present direct threat to the health
and safety of other individuals or the presence of the person at the PD-8 facility would result in substantial
physical damage to the property of others, the person will be required to leave the facility within twentyfour
(24) hours. The interpretation of “direct threat” shall be based on 42 U.S.C. Section 3604(f)(9) and the
cases interpreting the same.
4. Reporting. The operator of a facility in the PD-8 zone shall certify at least semi-annually in a sworn affidavit
to the City that based on the individualized assessment performed for each resident in the facility, no
person will or does reside in the facility whose tenancy would likely constitute a direct threat to the health
or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the
property of others. No building/structure shall be constructed without first obtaining a building permit
from the City.

to and harmonize with the requirements and restrictions of this section and Final Redevelopment Plans
#85-03-A and #85-03-B.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 742
2. Access to Property. The developer of property within the PD-12 zone shall be responsible for developing
the frontage roads in accordance with the design and locations agreed to by the City and the Utah
Department of Transportation. The City Council may waive the frontage road requirement if: 1) the
developer obtains the cross-easement agreements necessary to properly access and serve the developing
property and other properties that would be served by the frontage road, and if the cross-easement
agreements are made part of an overall circulation plan approved by the City Council, or 2) the developer
is successful in obtaining direct access to 1300 South Street from the Utah Department of Transportation
and if the access is approved by the City.
a. Each lot shall have not more than two (2) access ways to any one street. Each access way shall comply
with the following requirements:
(1) The width of any access way leading to a public street shall not exceed forty (40) feet at its
intersection with the property line. Curb returns shall have a minimum radius of fifteen (15) feet.
(2) The location and number of access ways shall be so arranged that they will reduce traffic hazards
as much as possible.
3. Access to 1200 South and 1400 South. No commercial development shall be permitted to have direct
accesses onto 1200 South Street or 1400 South Street, except for the approved accesses located on 1400
South at approximately 150 East Street.
4. Requirements for Parcel Development. Property subjected to the PD-12 zone shall be approved for
development only when the owner and/or developer present a development plan which meets the
following criteria:
a. The minimum area standards for development of a site shall be as follows:
(1) The parcel or parcels included in the development shall total at least three (3) acres in size. Parcels
smaller than three (3) acres may be created or developed if: a) the parcel is part of a condominium
development that meets the terms of this section; or b) the parcel is used in function and
appearance as an integral part of a three (3) acre or greater size development. Parcels smaller than
three (3) acres must be developed simultaneously with or subsequent to the development of the
three (3) acre or greater size development; and
(2) The entire development shall be substantially square or rectangular in shape; and
(3) The development shall extend entirely from 1300 South to 1400 South or from 1200 South to 1300
South with borders on 1300 South being equal in length to borders on 1400 South or 1200 South
respectively; and
(4) The development shall not be designed in such a way as to leave any parcel or parcels of property
which could not be developed under the requirements of this section.
b. No lot larger than three (3) acres in size shall be subdivided or otherwise split in such a way as to leave
a parcel less than three (3) acres in size.
c. The purpose of subsections (a) and (b) are:
(1) To ensure that large, regional retail, service and professional office developments will occur, as
opposed to small developments serving only the immediate neighborhood or community;
(2) To prevent the occurrence of further deterioration of the area, which would likely occur if the
smaller lots were to remain in residential use next to a large commercial development;
(3) To prevent the conversion of existing homes to small, piecemeal commercial establishments; and
(4) To allow for large, integrated commercial developments, with landscaped buffer areas bordering
1200 South, 1400 South and Main Streets. The inclusion of the smaller lots bordering those streets
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 743
will square off the developments, making a much more aesthetically pleasing development and
preventing a jagged boundary line, which would otherwise follow the uneven back lot lines of the
smaller lots.
5. Setbacks from Public Streets. All buildings shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from University Parkway
and Main Street and at least forty (40) feet from 1400 South.

22-11-27. PD-15 Zone, 2000 West Springwater Park Drive.
A. Purpose.
1. The purpose of the PD-15 zone is to accommodate development of a municipal golf course, city parks, and
public recreational facilities, while establishing adjacent areas for medium density residential
development. This particular mix of uses is not typically found in other zones of the City, so the PD-15 zone
is established to provide a unique area for coexistence of these uses, and to accomplish the City's goal of
developing a significant, high-quality municipal golf course and recreational facilities, and to promote the
overall vitality of the neighborhood and the City.
2. The purposes described above are accomplished by:
a. Allowing densities higher than a typical residential development;
b. Requiring the consolidation of open spaces; and
c. Establishing higher standards for landscaping, building and site design, public safety, parking,
aesthetics, traffic circulation, fencing, lighting, and other similar site improvements.

B. Concept Plan.
1. The Concept Plan included herein as Appendix G designates in general terms the proportions, locations,
and types of uses to be developed within the PD-15 zone and shall guide site layout and development
within the zone. The Concept Plan shows generally where the golf course, open spaces, public parks, and
residential developments shall be located. Prior to final approval of any development within the zone, the
City shall verify that the project follows the general layout of the Concept Plan. No request for
development within the PD-15 zone shall be approved which, in the opinion of the City, significantly differs
from the Concept Plan. The City may amend the Concept Plan by following the requirements of Section 22-
1-5 of this Chapter. The Concept Plan shall be considered the Preliminary Development Plan referred to in
Section 22-11-3(B) of this Chapter. Appendix G is incorporated herein by reference and is made a part of
this Section 22-11-27.
2. Before any final plat may be recorded for any property located in either Areas “A” or “B” as shown on
Appendix G, a preliminary plat must be approved for the entire Area “A” or “B” respectively. Before a site
plan may be approved in any area identified as Area “C”, an area Concept Plan for the entire Area “C”
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 752
containing the site plan must be approved by the City Council. The area Concept Plan shall show the
general location of roads, building footprints, areas of open space, and the general design and type of
structures and residences.

required by this Article and agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless from any claims, suits or
judgments arising from the condition of property dedicated to the City, from the time that the property is
dedicated to the City to the time when the improvements on the dedicated property are finally accepted
by the City (including the passage of the warranty period).
6. If, for any reason, the funds or bonds set aside or provided for the guarantee of improvements are
insufficient to properly complete the improvements, the developer shall be personally liable to complete
the improvements required by this Section. If the developer is a corporation, the principal officers of the

Q. Lot Grading.
1. Definition of Grading. For the purposes of this Section, grading shall be defined as any work including
filling, cutting, excavation or relocation of material which affects the contour, slope, elevation or drainage
features of a parcel of property.
2. No Grading of Land With 25% Slope or Greater Without Permit from City Engineer. No person shall be
permitted to grade, cut, excavate, fill, or to erect any structure on any land with a slope equal to or greater
than twenty-five percent (25%) without first obtaining a permit therefor from the City Engineer.
3. Application for Permit. Any person proposing to grade, cut, excavate, fill or to erect any structure on any
land with a slope equal to or greater than 25% shall submit a geologic and geotechnical report pertaining
to the relevant slope area that meets the following requirements:
a. The report shall be prepared by a qualified, licensed engineer.
b. The report shall include boring logs, geologic cross sections, trench and test pit logs, laboratory data
(particularly shear strength test results including individual stress- deformation plots from direct shear
tests), discussions pertaining to how idealized subsurface conditions and shear strength parameters
used for analyses were developed, analytical results, and summaries of the slope stability analyses and
conclusions regarding slope stability.
c. Subsurface geologic and groundwater conditions must be illustrated on geologic cross sections and
must be utilized by the geotechnical engineer for the slope stability analyses. If on-site sewage or
storm water disposal exists or is proposed, the slope stability analyses shall include the effects of the
effluent plume on slope stability
d. The results of any slope stability analyses must be submitted with pertinent backup documentation
(i.e., calculations, computer output, etc.). Printouts of input data, output data (if requested), and
graphical plots must be submitted for each computer-aided slope stability analysis. Stability shall be
analyzed along cross sections depicting the most adverse conditions (e.g., highest slope, most adverse
bedding planes, shallowest likely ground water table, and steepest slope). In addition to static slope
stability analyses, slopes shall also be evaluated for seismic slope stability.
e. Design ground motion parameters for seismic slope stability analyses shall be based on the peak
accelerations with a 2.0 percent probability for a M>7 surface faulting earthquake in 50 years (2,500-
year return period). Peak bedrock ground motions can be readily obtained via the internet from the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Seismic Hazard Maps, Data and Documentation web
page (USGS, 2002), which is based on Frankel et al., 2002. PGAs (peak ground acceleration) obtained
from the USGS (2002) web page should be adjusted for effects of soil/rock (site-class) conditions in
accordance with Seed et al. (2001). Site specific response analysis may also be used to develop PGA
values as long as the procedures, input data, and results are thoroughly documented, and deemed
acceptable by the city.
4. Conditions for Granting of Permit. The City Engineer shall grant a grading permit if the following
requirements are met:
a. A complete application containing all of the information required above is provided to the City
Engineer.
b. The geologic and geotechnical report clearly demonstrates that the following requirements are met:
(1) The minimum acceptable static factor of safety is 1.5 for both gross and surficial slope stability. The
minimum acceptable factor of safety for a calibrated pseudostatic analysis is 1.0 using the method
of Stewart, J.P., Blake, T.M., and Hollingsworth, R.A. (2003), Development of a Screen Analysis
Procedure for Seismic Slope Stability: Earthquake Spectra, 19 (3), pp. 697-712.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 781
(2) The proposed grading of the slope area will not negatively affect adjacent property and will not
limit the ability of adjacent property owners to develop their property.

X. Bonds.
1. Purpose. Prior to the recording of any documents concerning any phase of an approved PD-21
development, and prior to the issuance of any building permit on land included within a PD-21
development, the applicant shall post a bond with the City in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of all
public improvements required for that phase by the approved site plan, preliminary plat, final plat,
preliminary development plan, development agreement, the PD-21 ordinance and other applicable City
ordinances, including but not limited to, landscaping and sprinkling systems, asphalt, curb, gutter,
sidewalk, fencing, recreational facilities, piping of irrigation ditches, and any other item required as part of
the approved site plan. The bond shall be a guarantee that the proper installation of all required
improvements shall be completed within two (2) years of the date of approval of the site plan or recording
of the final plat, whichever is later or at such time as the approving body may designate, and that the
improvements shall remain free from defects for six (6) months or until April 15 of the following year,
whichever is longer. The City shall not release this bond until the City accepts the improvements.
2. Type. The bond shall be an irrevocable letter of credit, escrow bond, cash bond or combination bond in
favor of the City. The requirements relating to each of these types of bonds are found in Section 17-6-6 of
the Orem City Code. The City reserves the right to reject any of the bond types if it has a rational basis for
doing so. The bond shall be delivered to the Department of Development Services.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 795
3. Amount. The Public Works Director or his designee shall determine the amount of the required bond by
estimating the cost of completing the required improvements. The amount of the bond shall be at least
one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated costs of the required improvements.
4. Nonwaiver. This section does not waive the bonding, licensing, or permit requirements set forth in other
City ordinances except that this section replaces the subdivision bond required in section 17-6-6 of the
Orem City Code.
5. The City shall not record the final plat until the developer of the PD-21 development has tendered the
bond and entered into an agreement with the City in which the developer agrees to install the
improvements as required by this Article and agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless from any
claims, suits or judgments arising from the condition of property dedicated to the City, from the time that
the property is dedicated to the City to the time when the improvements on the dedicated property are
finally accepted by the City (including the passage of the warranty period.)
6. An applicant may request an extension of up to two (2) years for the completion of improvements from
the Public Works Director. The Public Works Director may grant an extension of up to two years if the
applicant demonstrates good cause for not completing the improvements and demonstrates the present
ability to complete the improvements.
7. If, for any reason, the bonds providing for the guarantee of improvements are insufficient to properly
complete the improvements, the developer shall be personally liable to complete the improvements
required by this Article.
8. The bonds required by this Section are for the sole benefit of the City. The bonds are not for the individual
benefit of any citizen or identifiable class of citizens, including the owners or purchasers of lots or units
within the PD-21 development. The bonds are not for the purpose of ensuring payment of contractors,
subcontractors or suppliers of labor or materials, and no contractors, subcontractors or suppliers of labor
or materials shall have a cause of action against the City or the bond for providing labor or materials..

A. Introduction and Purpose. The PD 22 zone is designed to be applied only in an area located between 800
North Street and approximately 1050 North Street and between 900 West Street and 1200 West Street (old
alignment). This property is a gateway to the City of Orem and as such is uniquely suited for commercial,
office, and residential uses. Its development for these uses is important to the economic vitality and tax base
of the City of Orem. The PD 22 zone is designed to maximize office, commercial, and residential uses within a
mixed-use setting. The PD 22 zone is also the intended to reduce vehicular trips by designing a community
where people can live close to where they work and shop. A major objective of the PD-22 zone is to create
aesthetically pleasing streetscapes with landscaping that buffers sidewalks from major vehicular traffic ways,
landscape features that take advantage of the unique terrain within the zone, recreational Amenities, and
social gathering areas that promote a walkable community.

800 North Street, 1200 West Street, 900 West Street, and general locations of private streets, driveways, and
parking areas; 3) plans for surface water runoff detention; 4) street cross-sections that include sidewalks
buffered from vehicular traffic ways by a landscape strip; 5) building renderings that illustrate design elements
to be used throughout the zone that give the PD-22 zone a “sense of place”; 6) integration elements that
encourage pedestrian activity and flow between residential areas and mixed-use and commercial areas; and
7) open spaces, common areas, and Amenities.

spillover light shall be limited to one (1) foot-candle at the property line where adjacent to any
residentially zoned property. The lighting plan shall be designed to:
a. discourage crime;
b. enhance the safety of the pedestrians and guests of the PD-34 development; and
c. enhance the appearance and design of the project.
10. Streetscapes. Sidewalks, landscaping and planter trees shall be provided and maintained adjacent to
public and private streets in accordance with Appendix BB. All streetscapes that are included in a
development phase shall be installed by the developer concurrent with the development of that phase.
11. Off-site Improvements. Off-site curb, gutter, sidewalk, and/or other improvements may be required by
the City if development on the site contributes to a need for such off-site facilities and the improvements
required are roughly proportional to the amount of the off-site impact caused by development in the PD-
34 zone
12. Utilities. All structures shall be served by the public sewer system and public water supply. All utilities shall
be placed underground. Utility lines 18” and smaller may be located inside an underground parking
structure provided that adequate space is maintained to allow for maintenance and repairs. Utility lines
larger than 18” may be located underneath parking structure provided they are encased in a sleeve.
13. Storage Areas and Solid Waste Receptacles. Dumpsters and compactors may be located within a building
or parking structure provided that they are located within a one hour fire rated enclosure. All outside

City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 851
I. Limit on Number of Residential Units. In order to ensure that the PD-34 zone remains primarily a retail
development, the number of residential dwelling units allowed in the PD-34 zone shall not exceed the ratio of
1.5 residential units for every 1,000 square feet of retail development. For purposes of this section, retail
development shall be defined as a use, the majority of sales or revenues of which, are subject to Utah state
sales tax.
(Ord. No. O-2013-0033, Enacted 12/11/2013)
J. Signs--Purpose and Intent. Due to the size and nature of the PD-34 zone, the purposes and objectives
pertaining to signage in the PD-34 zone are significantly different from those of any other area in the City.
Therefore, the regulations applicable to signage in the PD-34 zone shall also differ significantly from the
regulations applicable to signage in other areas of the City. Signage in the PD-34 zone shall be subject to more
exacting/stringent requirements as to architectural style and aesthetics and shall also have more liberal
treatment as to off-premise signage than other areas in the City. The more stringent requirements (as to
aesthetics) and the more liberal treatment (as to off-premise signage) are justified by the following:
1. Development in the PD-34 zone (both existing and future) is the most intensive area of commercial activity
in the City both in terms of size (acreage) and commercial activity (based on retail sales) as compared to
any other development in the City. The area of the PD-34 zone is effectively the commercial hub of the
City. It is anticipated that with the adoption of the PD-34 zone, commercial activity will become even more
intense with the addition of new retail buildings, office buildings and parking structures. Off-premise signs
are consistent and compatible with a development of this size, scale and intensity of use while they are
not appropriate in most other commercial areas of the City. Off-premise signage is allowed in other large
commercial and mixed use developments throughout the country that are similar to development in the
PD-34 zone (both existing and future) and the City has determined that off-premise signage will also be
compatible in the PD-34 zone.
2. The signage allowed in the PD-34 zone, including off-premise signage, will enhance the aesthetic quality of
the PD-34 zone. Unlike any other zone or area in the City, signage in the PD-34 zone will be required to
conform to strict standards of architectural style and aesthetic quality. Signage in the PD-34 zone is
considered a critical component of development in the zone, not just for the messages they contain, but
also for the aesthetic appeal of the signs themselves. In addition to their architectural quality, different
types of signs, including allowable off-premise signs, are intended to enhance the aesthetic quality of the
development in several ways, including, but not limited to the following:
a. Mitigating and improving the appearance of normally unsightly parking structures by covering
unattractive structure facades with attractive and aesthetically appealing signage.
b. Enhancing the appearance of bare walls of buildings.
c. Improving the appearance and adding interest to streetscapes, parking areas, sidewalks.
d. Creating an aesthetically pleasing “grand entrance” or “gateway” effect through the placement of
signage at entryways into the development.
3. The overall signage scheme in the PD-34 zone, with its variety in types of signs combined with the unique
architecture, style, light, color and electronic display is designed to create a visual experience and a sense
of excitement, energy and vibrancy that cannot be achieved or replicated on smaller, individual parcels.
This will enhance the quality of the PD-34 zone as a “destination” and gathering place for consumers in the
city, county and state.
4. Signage in the PD-34 zone, including off-premise signage, will be part of a controlled and coordinated
whole that is designed to enhance and be harmonious with its surroundings as opposed to an uncontrolled
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 852
and uncoordinated scheme of individual sign approvals. This will dramatically reduce the risk of a
proliferation of unattractive signage by numerous and disparate private parties.
(Ord. No. O-2013-0033, Enacted 12/11/2013)

to, but no more than two persons per bedroom.
(Ord. No. O-2013-0033, Enacted 12/11/2013)
M. Home Occupations. Because of the mixed-use nature of the PD-34 zone and because none of the residential
units in the PD-34 zone will be directly accessed by public streets, the provisions of Orem City Code Section
22-14-15 (as amended) pertaining to home occupations, shall not apply to the PD-34 zone. However, any

dwelling unit.
d. Hotels and Houses of Worship. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, one stall per room
shall be required for hotels and one stall shall be required for every four fixed seats for a house of
worship (churches, synagogues, mosques, etc.).
e. Senior Independent Living Facility. One parking stall shall be provided per dwelling unit.
2. Parking for Each Phase. The parking requirements shall be met for each phase of construction.
3. Paving. All parking spaces, parking areas and driveways shall be paved with asphalt and/or concrete and

the PD-34 zone. For all other buildings, bicycle parking stalls shall be provided with each site plan at a rate
of at least two percent (2%) of the number of required automobile parking spaces required. However, the
number of bicycle parking spaces required shall not be less than three (3) or more than ten (10) spaces per
building (other than the main building). The Director of Development Services may reduce or waive the
bicycle parking requirement for developments that, in the opinion of the Director of Development
Services, are not likely to attract bicycle traffic because of the nature, location or other circumstances
associated with the development. Developments that are not likely to attract bicycle traffic include, but
are not limited to, a car wash and personal storage units.
8. Bicycle Parking Facilities. Bicycle facilities, including either lockers or racks, shall be provided in all areas in
which required bicycle parking spaces are provided. Required bicycle facilities shall:
a. Provide for storage and locking of bicycles, either in lockers, medium-security racks or equivalent

e. Consist of racks or lockers anchored so that they cannot be easily removed and of solid construction,
resistant to rust, corrosion, hammers, and saws;
f. Be consistent with their environment in color and design and be incorporated whenever possible into
building or street furniture design; and
g. Be located in convenient, highly visible, active, well-lighted areas, but not interfere with pedestrian
movements.

structures that are most visible from public streets, the side of any parking structure that faces a public
street shall be enhanced by using one or more of the following techniques or practices: building liners,
screen signs, artistic facades, trees and landscaping, and other methods illustrated in Appendix BB.
(Ord. No. O-2013-0033, Enacted 12/11/2013)
O. Occupancy of Residential Units. Because the PD-34 zone contains a mix of uses with commercial and
residential uses located in proximity to each other, it is expected that individuals who choose to live in the PD-
34 zone will have a higher tolerance for the noises, sights, and smells that are traditionally associated with
commercial uses than individuals who live in traditional residential zones. Therefore, notwithstanding any
other provision in City ordinances to the contrary, any noise, sight or smell that is clearly incidental to and
customarily associated with a permitted use in the PD-34 zone (including but not limited to noise emanating
from the operation of refrigerated truck units at any time of day or night) shall not be considered a violation
of the City’s disturbing the peace ordinance (Section 9-2-9) or a violation of the City’s nuisance ordinances
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 858
(Article 11-1) as they may affect residents who live in the PD-34 zone. However, nothing herein shall be
construed to affect the applicability of the City’s disturbing the peace ordinance or nuisance ordinances as to
noises, sights and smells emanating from the PD-34 zone that affect individuals who do not live within the PD-
34 zone.

G. Bonds.
1. Purpose. Prior to the recording of any final plat in the PD-37 zone and prior to the issuance of any building
permit on land included within a PD-37 development, the applicant shall post a bond with the City in an
amount sufficient to cover the cost of all required improvements required for that phase by the approved
site plan, preliminary plat, final plat, Concept Plan, the PD-37 ordinance and other applicable City
ordinances, including but not limited to landscaping and sprinkling systems, asphalt, curb, gutter, sidewalk,
fencing, recreational facilities, piping of irrigation ditches, and any other item required as part of the
approved site plan. The bond shall be a guarantee that the proper installation of all required
improvements shall be completed within two (2) years of the date of approval of the site plan or recording
of the final plat, whichever is later or at such time as the approving body may designate, and that the
improvement shall remain free from defects for a period of one year after the City's final acceptance of
the improvements. The bonds required by this Section are for the sole benefit of the City. The bonds are
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 868
not for the individual benefit of any citizen or identifiable class of citizens, including the owners or
purchasers of lots or units within the PD-37 development. The bonds are not for the purpose of ensuring
payment of contractors, subcontractors or suppliers of labor or materials, and no contractors,
subcontractors or suppliers of labor or material shall have a cause of action against the City or the bond
for providing labor or materials. Bond releases may be applied for as each bonded item is completed and
authorized by Orem City officials, with the exception of 10% warranty held for one (1) year.
2. Type. The bond shall be an irrevocable letter of credit, escrow bond, cash bond or combination bond in
favor of the City. The requirements relating to each of these types of bonds are found in section 17-6-6 of

doing so. The bond shall be delivered to the Department of Development Services
3. Amount. The Development Services Director or his designee shall determine the amount of the required
bond by estimating the cost of completing the required improvements. The amount of the bond shall be at
least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated costs of the required improvements.
4. Nonwaiver. This section does not waive the bonding, licensing, or permit requirements set forth in other
City ordinances except that this section replaces the subdivision bond required in section 17-6-6 Orem City
Code.
5. Plat Recording. The City shall not record any final plat until the developer of the PD-37 development has
tendered the bond and entered into an agreement with the City in which the developer agrees to install
the improvements as required by this Section and agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless from
any claims, suits or judgments arising from the condition of property dedicated to the City, from the time
that the property is dedicated to the City to the time when the improvements on the dedicated property
are finally accepted by the City (including the passage of the warranty period).
6. Completion of Improvements Extension. An applicant may request an extension of up to two (2) years for
the completion of improvements from the Development Services Director. The Development Services
Director may grant an extension of up to two years if the applicant demonstrates good cause for not
completing the improvements and demonstrates the present ability to complete the improvements.
7. Liability for Improvements. If for any reason the bonds providing for the guarantee of improvements are
insufficient to properly complete the improvements, the developer shall be liable to complete the
improvements required by this section.

whichever is later or at such time as the approving body may designate, and that the improvements shall
remain free from defects for a period of one year after the City's final acceptance of the improvements.
The bonds required by this Section are for the sole benefit of the City. The bonds are not for the individual
benefit of any citizen or identifiable class of citizens, including the owners or purchasers of lots or units
within the PD-47 development. The bonds are not for the purpose of ensuring payment of contractors,
subcontractors or suppliers of labor or materials, and no contractors, subcontractors or suppliers of labor
or material shall have a cause of action against the City or the bond for providing labor or materials. Bond
releases may be applied for as each bonded item is completed and authorized by Orem City officials, with
the exception that ten percent (10%) of the bonded amount shall be held by the City for one year to
warrant the satisfactory completion of the improvements.
2. Type. The bond shall be an irrevocable letter of credit, escrow bond, cash bond or combination bond in
favor of the City. The requirements relating to each of these types of bonds are found in section 17-6-6 of
the Orem City Code. The City reserves the right to reject any of the bond types if it has a rational basis for
doing so. The bond shall be delivered to the Department of Development Services
3. Amount. The Development Services Director or his designee shall determine the amount of the required
bond by estimating the cost of completing the required improvements. The amount of the bond shall be at
least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated costs of the required improvements.

City ordinances except that this section replaces the subdivision bond required in section 17-6-6 Orem City
Code.
5. Plat Recording. The City shall not record any final plat until the developer of the PD-47 development has
tendered the bond and entered into an agreement with the City in which the developer agrees to install
the improvements as required by this Section and agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless from
any claims, suits or judgments arising from the condition of property dedicated to the City, from the time
that the property is dedicated to the City to the time when the improvements on the dedicated property
are finally accepted by the City (including the passage of the warranty period).
6. Liability for Improvements. If for any reason the bonds providing for the guarantee of improvements are

for storage and locking of bicycles, either in lockers, medium-security covered racks or equivalent facilities
in which the user may lock both the bicycle frame and the wheels.
4. Buffer. Because of the high density which is allowed in the student housing overlay zone, developments in
the student housing overlay zone must provide a substantial buffer between the development and all
residentially zoned parcels located adjacent to the development (including residential parcels located
directly across a public street from the development) which are not included within the student housing
overlay zone. The buffer shall reduce to the greatest extent practical, the visual and noise impact of the
development on adjacent residential parcels. The buffer required by this subsection may be accomplished
through the use of a combination of existing features such as public streets and substantial natural
topographical variances (where present), and significant landscaping such as trees, walls and berms.
5. Landscaping.
a. All land within the student housing overlay zone not covered by buildings, driveways, sidewalks,
structures, and parking areas, shall be permanently and maintained in accordance with good
landscaping practices. All landscaping shall have a permanent underground sprinkling system.

evergreen trees, at least five (5) gallons in size, are required at a ratio of one deciduous and one
evergreen per every 3,000 square feet of landscaped area. Evergreen shrubs, at least five (5) gallons in
size, are required at a ratio of one per every 1,000 square feet of landscaped area.
d. The required building setback from public streets shall be landscaped and shall include landscaped
berms, trees, and shrubs.
6. Lighting Plan. All student housing site plans shall include a lighting plan. The lighting plan shall be designed
to:
a. Discourage crime;
ii. Enhance the safety of the residents and guests of the project;
iii. Prevent direct glare of lighting onto adjacent properties; and
iv. Enhance the appearance and design of the project.
7. Building Setbacks.
a. Buildings shall be set back from property in any residential zone, other than property in the Student
Housing Overlay, at least twenty feet (20') or equal to the height of the structure, whichever is greater.
Buildings shall be set back from adjacent property in the Student Housing Overlay at least twenty feet
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 920
(20'). Buildings shall beset back from all public streets at least forty feet (40'). However, if the adjacent
property is Interstate 15 right-of-way, the minimum building setback from the right-of-way line shall
be ten feet (10') regardless of building height, except as provided in subsection (C) below.
b. Roof overhangs, bay windows, box windows, chimneys, covered stairwells, and stairs, may encroach
into the required setbacks no more than twenty-four inches (24"). Porches and the roofs over them
may project up to five (5) feet into the required setback.
c. No setback shall be required for parking structures adjacent to 1-15 provided that UDOT approves a
landscape plan showing trees within the 1-15 right-of-way. The trees shall be planted and maintained
parallel to the parking structure, shall be no further than eight feet (8') from I-15 right-of-way, and
shall be spaced a minimum of thirty feet (30') along the width of the parking structure. The landscape
plan approved by UDOT shall be submitted with the request to reduce the setback less than ten feet
(10'). Trees shall be either deciduous or evergreen. Deciduous trees shall be at least three (3") inches
in caliper measured four (4) feet above the rootball. Evergreen trees shall be at least ten feet (10') tall
after planting. All trees must be irrigated with a drip irrigation system. The Planning Commission may
waive the tree requirement if it finds permission for the trees cannot be obtained from UDOT or that
planting of the trees is contrary to the health, safety or welfare of the City.
8. Building Materials. At least sixty percent (60%) of the exterior finish materials of all elevations of all
buildings shall consist of either brick, stone, or cultured stone. The remaining percentage of the exterior
finish materials shall consist of either brick, stone, cultured stone, stucco, E.I.F.S. or wood.
9. Architectural Styling. The exterior of all buildings shall demonstrate a variety in color, relief, and rhythm.
Facade depth should change with a minimum 2-foot offset at least every sixty (60') linear feet, on all sides
of the buildings.

L. Shuttle Transportation to Utah Valley State College. The owner(s) of a development in the student housing
overlay zone shall provide a no-charge shuttle service between the development and Utah Valley State
College if the nearest part of the student housing development:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 922
1. Is located more than one-half (1/2) of a mile from the Sorensen Student Center on the UVSC campus, or
anywhere west of Interstate 15, and
2. Is expected to generate more than twenty (20) one-way trips between UVSC and the development during
any weekday hour between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. as determined by the traffic study.
The number of shuttle trips that the owner(s) of the development shall be required to provide in any given hour
shall be based on the number of estimated trips which the development is expected to generate between the
development and UVSC during that hour. During each weekday hour between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 11:00
p.m., the development shall provide one shuttle round- trip between the development and UVSC for every twenty
(20) one-way trips which the development is expected to generate between UVSC and the development as
illustrated in the table below:
Number of one-way trips between development and UVSC
per hour Number of required shuttle round-trips per hour
0-19 trips 0
20-39 trips 1
40-59 trips 2
60-79 trips 3
80-99 trips 4
100-119 trips 5
120-139 trips 6
The owner shall use its best efforts to establish and maintain a consistent and reliable schedule for the shuttle
operation and shall also space the timing of the shuttle departures to maximize the number of students who can
be transported between the development and UVSC. Each shuttle must be capable of transporting ten (10) or
more students per trip. Trips made by shuttles which have the capacity to transport twenty or more students shall
count as two trips. Trips made by shuttles having the capacity to transport thirty (30) or more students shall count
as three trips. If a development’s shuttle requirement is met by sharing shuttle capacity with another
development or other entity, the shuttle must have the separate capacity to transport at least ten students from
the development in order to count as one shuttle trip for that development. For example, if the owners of three
separate developments in the student housing overlay zone contract with an independent entity to provide
shuttle service to and from UVSC for each of the three developments and the shuttle has the capacity to transport
30 students, each of the three developments may count the shuttle trip as one trip. However, if the shuttle has
the capacity to transport only 25 students, only two of the developments may count the shuttle trip as one trip
toward meeting their shuttle requirement.

M. Revised Traffic Study. The owner(s) of a development in the student housing overlay zone shall provide to the
City a revised traffic study which meets the requirements of Subsection K at any time upon the City’s request
within one year from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development. The owner shall also
provide such a revised traffic study to the City at any time after one year upon the City’s request if the City
reasonably believes that the development is generating more trips to and from UVSC than were estimated in
the most recent traffic study for the development. The owner(s) shall also have the option to submit a revised
traffic study to the City at the owner’s discretion at any time. The shuttle requirements for the development

N. Modification of Shuttle Requirements. In order to determine the effectiveness and adequacy of the shuttle
requirements set forth above, the owner(s) of each development shall provide the City with information
regarding the total number of required shuttle trips, the scheduling of the shuttle trips, and the approximate
percentage of student occupancy of the shuttle trips. This information shall be provided to the City six months
and one year after the completion of the development and annually thereafter upon the City’s request. The
City shall have the right to increase, decrease or otherwise modify the shuttle requirements set forth in
Subsection L as may be determined to be appropriate based on an analysis of the adequacy of the initial
requirements of Subsection L. The City may require all existing and proposed developments in the student

22-12-6. Agriculture Overlay Zone.
Introduction. A significant portion of the land within the City was formerly cultivated as fruit orchards. Due to the
growth of the City, most of the orchards in the City have now been converted to commercial or residential
development. The City Council believes that the existing orchards in the City make an important contribution to
the quality of life within the City by preserving open space, by providing diversity in the economy and diversity in
the use of land within the City, and by preserving an important part of the heritage of the City. Therefore, the City
Council believes that it is important to protect and encourage the reservation of existing orchards and other
agricultural uses within the City to the extent that they are compatible with residential uses. The agriculture
overlay zone is designed to encourage the preservation of agricultural uses, especially orchards, within the City:
A. Purpose. The purposes of the agriculture overlay zone (-AG) are as follows:
1. To encourage the preservation of existing agricultural uses within the City in areas where residential and
agricultural uses are compatible.
2. To provide owners and prospective owners of property located near property in the agriculture overlay
zone with notice of the potential positive and negative effects that may be associated with the agricultural
use of the property.

corrals shall be located at least one hundred feet (100') from the nearest dwelling and from any public street.
The raising and sheltering of farm animals shall be limited to the buildable area of the lot and shall be
permitted only where the use thereof and the products therefrom are primarily for the use or home
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 933
consumption of the landowners or occupant of the lot. Appropriate fencing shall be provided to ensure that
all animals are kept within the buildable area of the lot.

and not continuous, are the result of normal and accepted agricultural practices, and do not pose a threat to
the public health, safety or welfare.

This ordinance shall be known as the "Wireless Telecommunications Zoning Ordinance."
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended 06/12/2001; Ord.
No. O-01-0043, Amended 11/13/2001)
22-13-2. Purpose.
The purposes of this ordinance are:
A. To regulate personal wireless services antennas, and related electronic equipment and structures.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-97-0012, Amended, 02/25/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001;
Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
B. To provide for the orderly establishment of personal wireless services facilities in the City.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 940
C. To minimize the number of antenna support structures by encouraging the use of stealth facilities, by
encouraging the co-location of multiple antennas on a single structure, by encouraging the location of
antennas on pre-existing support structures, and by encouraging the use of City-owned property for antenna
support structures.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
D. To establish siting, appearance, and safety standards that will help mitigate potential impacts related to the
construction, use and maintenance of personal wireless services facilities.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
E. To comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by establishing regulations that (1) do not prohibit or
have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, (2) do not unreasonably discriminate
among providers of functionally equivalent services, and (3) are not based on the environmental effects of
radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Federal Communication
Commission’s regulations concerning such emissions.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
22-13-3. Findings.
The City Council makes the following findings:
A. Personal wireless services devices are an integral part of the rapidly growing and evolving telecommunications
industry, and present unique zoning challenges and concerns for the City.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
B. The City needs to balance the interests and desires of the telecommunications industry and its customers to
provide competitive and effective telecommunications systems in the City, against the sometimes differing
interests and desires of others concerning health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics, and orderly planning of the
community.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
C. The City has experienced an increased demand for personal wireless services facilities to be located in the
City, and expects the increased demand to continue into the future.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
D. It is in the best interests of the City to have quality personal wireless services available, which necessarily
entails the erection of personal wireless services facilities in the City.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
E. The unnecessary proliferation of personal wireless services facilities throughout the City creates a negative
visual impact on the community.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
F. The visual effects of personal wireless services facilities can be mitigated by fair standards regulating their
siting, construction, maintenance and use.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 941
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
G. The City owns numerous large parcels of property evenly spread throughout the City, where personal wireless
services facilities can be located so as to be as inoffensive as possible to the residents and businesses of the
City.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-97-0012, Amended, 02/25/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001;
Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
H. Spacing personal wireless services facilities evenly throughout the city reduces the negative impact created by
the proliferation of telecommunication towers.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
I. Because of the height and appearance of some personal wireless services facilities, surrounding properties
bear a disproportionate share of the negative impacts of a telecommunications tower.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
J. A private property owner who leases space for a personal wireless services facility is the only one who
receives compensation for the facility, even though numerous other property owners in the area are adversely
affected by the location of the facility.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
K. Encouraging personal wireless services facilities to be located on City property, with lease payments paid to
the City instead of an individual property owner, indirectly compensates all citizens of the community for the
adverse impacts of the facilities, and is therefore the fairest method of distributing burden and benefit.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-97-0012, Amended, 02/25/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001;
Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
L. Locating antennas on existing buildings and structures, or constructing an antenna as a stealth facility, creates
less of a negative visual impact on the community than the erection of towers.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
M. Buildings and structures on public property are capable of being used to provide support for antenna arrays,
thus reducing the proliferation of towers in all areas of the City.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
N. The public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of telecommunication towers and to mitigate their
impact can best be facilitated by encouraging the use of less visually intrusive antennas and permitting the
locating of wireless communication systems on telecommunication towers and antenna support structures
that are located on property owned, leased, or used by the City.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-97-0012, Amended, 02/25/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001;
Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
O. The requirements set forth in this ordinance for the placement of personal wireless services facilities on
property owned, leased or used by the City are necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of
the community.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 942
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-97-0012, Amended, 02/25/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001;
Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
P. Chapter 69-3, Utah Code Annotated, grants cities the authority to create or acquire sites to accommodate the
erection of telecommunication towers in order to promote the location of telecommunication towers in a
manageable area and to protect the aesthetics and environment of the area. The law also allows the City to
require the owner of any tower to accommodate the multiple use of the tower by other companies where
feasible and to pay the City the fair market rental value for the use of any City-owned site.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-97-0012, Amended, 02/25/1997; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)

order of priority:
1. Existing Structures or Stealth Facilities. First priority shall be granted to antennas located on existing
structures or antennas qualifying as stealth facilities, as follows:
a. Existing Structures. Lawfully existing buildings, structures and antenna support structures, provided
that the buildings, structures or support structures are: (1) located in a nonresidential zone, or (2)
located in a residential zone on property that is being used for nonresidential uses (e.g. government,
school or church), or (3) located in a residential zone on a property that is being used for a multifamily
residential building having eight (8) or more dwelling units; or
b. Stealth Facilities. Antennas certified as stealth facilities as set forth in this ordinance.
2. Monopoles on City-owned Property. Monopoles constructed on City-owned property.

22-13-11. Specific Regulations by Type.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 946
Wireless facilities are characterized by the type or location of the antenna structure. There are four general types
of antenna structures contemplated by this ordinance: wall mounted antennas; roof mounted antennas; stealth
facilities; and monopoles. If a particular type of antenna structure is allowed by this ordinance as a permitted or
conditional use, the minimum standards for that type of antenna are as follows, unless otherwise provided in a
conditional use permit:
A. Wall Mounted Antennas.
1. Maximum Height. Wall mounted antennas shall not extend above the roof line of the building or structure
or extend more than four (4) feet horizontally from the face of the building.
2. Setback. Wall mounted antennas shall not be located within twenty feet (20') feet of a residential zone.
3. Mounting Options. Antennas mounted directly on existing parapet walls, penthouses, or mechanical
equipment rooms are considered to be wall mounted antennas if no portion of the antenna extends above
the roof line of the parapet wall, penthouse, or mechanical equipment room.
4. Color. Wall mounted antennas, equipment and supporting structures shall be painted to match the color
of the building or structure or the background against which they are most commonly seen. Antennas and
the supporting structure on the building shall be architecturally compatible with the building. Whip
antennas are not allowed on a wall mounted antenna structure.
5. Maximum Area. The total area for all wall mounted antennas and supporting structures on any one
building shall not exceed five percent (5%) of any exterior wall of the building.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-00-0007, Amended, 02/22/2000; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001;
Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
B. Roof Mounted Antennas.
1. Maximum Height. The maximum height of a roof mounted antenna shall be eighteen feet (18') above the
roof line of the building.
2. Setback. Roof mounted antennas shall be setback from the exterior wall of the building or structure a
distance at least equal to the height of the antenna above the roof.
3. Mounting options. Roof mounted antennas may be mounted directly on a roof, or on top of existing
penthouses or mechanical equipment rooms if the total height of the antennas do not exceed eighteen
feet (18') above the roof line of the building.
4. Color. Roof mounted antennas, equipment and supporting structures shall be painted to match the color
of the building or structure or the background against which they are most commonly seen. Antennas and
supporting structures shall be architecturally compatible with the building.
5. Combination of Wall and Roof Mounted Antennas. Any building may have a combination of wall and roof
mounted antennas meeting the requirements of this ordinance.
C. Stealth Facilities.
1. Maximum Height. The maximum height of a stealth facility shall be eighteen feet (18’) higher than the
maximum permitted structure height of the zone in which the stealth facility is located. The applicant may
exceed the maximum structure height if otherwise allowed in this Chapter, or pursuant to a conditional
use permit.
2. Determination. Not every disguised or screened wireless facility qualifies as a stealth facility. Whether or
not a particular facility qualifies as a stealth facility shall be decided by the City Council as part of the
conditional use permit approval process. In making the decision, the City Council shall consider the
definition of Stealth Facilities set forth in this Article and shall consider whether the facility is disguised,
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 947
blended or screened in a manner that eliminates any negative impact of the wireless facility. Each stealth
facility certification applies to one location only. Because of differing circumstances specific to each site,
an antenna that qualifies as a stealth facility in one location may not qualify as a stealth facility in a
different location.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-00-0007, Amended, 02/22/2000; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001;
Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
D. Monopoles. If the applicant desires to construct a monopole, the applicant shall first submit a detailed written
description of why the applicant cannot obtain coverage using existing buildings or structures or stealth
facilities.
1. Maximum Height and Width. The maximum height of the monopole or monopole antenna shall be
seventy-five feet (75'), although the approving body may, as a conditional use, allow an antenna or
antenna support structure up to 110 feet (110’) in height, if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the approving body that the additional height is necessary to obtain coverage or to allow co-location,
and that the applicant has taken steps to mitigate adverse effects on the surrounding neighborhood. The
antenna itself shall not exceed ten feet (10') in height.
2. Setback. Monopoles shall be set back a minimum of 115% of the height of the monopole from any
residential lot line, measured from the base of the monopole to the nearest residential lot line.
3. Color. Monopoles, antennas, and related support structures shall be painted a neutral color, or a color to
match the background against which they are most commonly seen.
4. Distance from other Monopoles. Monopoles and towers shall be located at least one thousand feet
(1000') from each other, except upon a showing of necessity by the applicant, or upon a finding by the
approving authority that a closer distance would adequately protect the health, safety and welfare of the
community. This distance requirement shall not apply to stealth facilities or to antennas attached to lawful
structures such as transmission towers, utility poles, outdoor lighting structures, and water tanks.
5. Location on Parcel. Monopoles shall be located as unobtrusively on a parcel as possible, given the location
of existing structures, nearby residential areas, and service needs of the applicant. Monopoles shall not be
located in a required landscaped area, buffer area or parking area.
6. Co-Location Requirement. Unless otherwise authorized by the approving authority for good cause shown,
every new monopole shall be designed and constructed to be of sufficient size and capacity to
accommodate at least one additional wireless telecommunications provider on the structure in the future.
Any conditional use permit for the monopole may be conditioned upon the agreement of the applicant to
allow co-location of other personal wireless providers on such terms as are common in the industry.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-97-0012, Amended, 02/25/1997; Ord. No. O-98-0020, Amended, 04/28/1998;

services providers on such terms as are common in the industry.
(Ord. No. O-96-0024, Enacted, 11/12/1996; Ord. No. O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-01-0043, Amended, 11/13/2001)
22-13-13. Lease Agreement.
The City has no implied obligation to lease any particular parcel of City-owned property to an applicant. The City
shall enter into a standard lease agreement with the applicant for any facility built on City property. The City
Manager or designee is hereby authorized to execute the standard lease agreement on behalf of the City. The
Lease shall contain the condition that the site plan and/or conditional use permit must first be approved by the
approving authority before the lease can take effect, and that failure to obtain such approval renders the lease
null and void.
(Ord. No. O-01-0043, Enacted, 11/13/2001)
22-13-14. Safety.
A. Regulation Compliance.
1. Compliance with FCC and FAA regulations. All operators of wireless facilities shall demonstrate
compliance with applicable Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations, including FCC radio frequency regulations, at the time of application and
periodically thereafter as requested by the City. Failure to comply with the applicable regulations shall be
grounds for revoking a site plan or conditional use permit approval.
2. Other licenses and permits. The operator of every personal wireless services facility shall submit copies of
all licenses and permits required by other agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the design,
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 949

the climbing pegs from the lower 20 feet of the monopole.
2. Fencing. Monopoles and towers shall be fully enclosed by a minimum 6-foot tall fence or wall, as directed
by the City, unless the approving authority determines that a wall or fence is not needed or appropriate
for a particular site due to conditions specific to the site.
3. Security Lighting Requirements. Monopoles and towers shall comply with the FAA requirements for
lighting. As part of the conditional use permit consideration, the City may also require security lighting for
the site. If security lighting is used, the lighting impact on surrounding residential areas shall be minimized
by using indirect lighting, where appropriate.
(Ord. No. O-01-0043, Enacted, 11/13/2001)
C. Abandonment. The City may require the removal of all antennas and monopoles if the facility has been
inoperative or out of service for more than twelve (12) consecutive months.
1. Notice. Notice to remove shall be given in writing by personal service, or by certified mail addressed to the
operator’s last known address.
2. Violation. Failure to remove the antennas and monopoles after receiving written notice to remove is a
violation of the terms of this Chapter. The City may initiate criminal and/or civil legal proceeding against
any person, firm, entity or corporation, whether acting as principal, agent, property owner, lessee, lessor,
tenant, landlord, employee, employer or otherwise, for failure to remove antennas and monopoles in
accordance with this Chapter. The City may seek a civil injunction requiring the removal of any structures
on the site in accordance with this Chapter. The City may also remove such structures itself, and may bill
its costs in removing the structures to the operator. Any lease agreement with the City may also stipulate
failure to remove the antennas and monopoles after receiving written notice to do so pursuant to this
Chapter automatically transfers ownership of the antennas, monopoles, support buildings and all other
structures on the site to the City.
(Ord. No. O-01-0043, Enacted, 11/13/2001)
D. Emergency. The City shall have authority to move or alter a wireless facility in case of emergency. Before

22-14-8. Moving a House, Building or other Structure.
A. No house, building or other structure of any kind shall be brought into the City nor shall any house, building or
other structure be moved from one lot in the City to another lot within or outside the City until all of the
following conditions have been met:
1. If the home, building or structure is to be moved to a lot in the City, the person desiring to move the
structure must apply to the Department of Development Services and pay a fifty dollar ($50.00) fee to
have the structure and the proposed site of the structure inspected by the City before it is moved to
determine all of the changes or improvements necessary to bring the structure and site into compliance
with the City's current applicable codes (zoning, building, electrical, plumbing, etc.) relating to that
structure and site.
2. Detailed site and building plans must be submitted to and approved by the building inspector which
specify all of the modifications and improvements necessary to bring the structure and site into
compliance with all applicable City codes. The requirements for the building shall be identical to the
requirements for any newly constructed building. The site plan which is submitted must be drawn to scale
and show all relevant dimensions. In addition, the site plan shall indicate all adjacent lots as well as all

2. All landscaped areas shall be separated from off-street parking areas and driveways by a concrete curb or
other material approved by the City.
3. Unless expressly allowed by another section of the City Code, a required landscape area along State Street
or University Parkway may not be graded to a level that is below the average grade of the front and back
of the required landscaping. A required landscape area may not be graded to a depth of greater than one
foot below grade when adjacent to a collector or arterial street (other than State Street or University

1. At least fifty percent (50%) of each contiguous area required to be landscaped under this chapter shall be
planted and maintained with some combination of grass, shrubs, trees, flowers, vines, or other living
plants (excluding weeds). A contiguous area is an area that is not divided by sidewalks, drive accesses,
parking, buildings, or other similar dividing features (see Figure 1). No vegetation coverage higher than 24
inches above grade shall be counted toward the total coverage requirement. For example, a tree canopy
with foliage at a height of ten feet would not count as vegetative coverage for area other than that
occupied by the tree trunk. All areas required to be landscaped that are not covered with living plants as
described above shall may be covered and maintained with:
a. bark chips, mulches, and peat moss;
b. decorative rocks, bricks, boulders, gravel (provided that all such decorative materials are installed with
a depth of four inches (4”) or more with a weed block barrier underneath). The use of decorative
rocks, boulders, and gravel is only permitted to the extent that such materials are part of a deliberate
landscaping plan and not the result of the natural state of the land or neglect of the landscaping);
c. ornamental objects such as fountains, pools, statues, retaining walls, and benches; or
d. artificial or synthetic turf that: (1) is a soft polyethylene green synthetic fiber, (2) has a minimum
length of 1-1/2 inches (3) resembles real grass, (4) is ultra-violet light (UV) protected, treated, and
tufted on a porous backing, (5) has a surface that is infilled with a natural material such as sand, (6) is
permanently affixed to the ground to create a stable, weighted surface, (7) is installed over a
landscaping fabric that prevents the infiltration of weeds or unwanted vegetation, (8) is installed on a
surface that is designed, compacted, and graded for positive drainage. However, artificial and
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 958
synthetic turf are not allowed in any landscaped buffer strip located between a public street and a
required sidewalk.
2. The use of native, low maintenance, drought-tolerant plants in combination with non-living materials that
help retain moisture such as mulch and decorative gravel (xeriscape) is encouraged to meet the
landscaping requirements described above. A non-exhaustive list of native, drought-tolerant species can
be found in Appendix “VV”.
3. The minimum required living landscape coverage requirement shall be reduced from 50% to 45% where
three or more trees are maintained in the front yard or side yard adjacent to a street over and above the
number of trees that are required in such areas elsewhere in the City Code.
Figure 1: Example Diagram of Contiguous Areas
4. All required landscaped areas shall be maintained in a neat, clean, and orderly condition and in accordance
with good landscape maintenance practices. This includes proper pruning, lawn mowing, weeding,
removing of litter, fertilizing, replacing of dead plants and the regular watering of all living material within
landscaped areas. Required landscape maintenance also includes the removal of trees that pose a safety
hazard; trees that are dead, decayed, or diseased; and weeds or debris that constitute unsightly
appearance, present a danger to public safety and welfare, or prove detrimental to neighboring
properties.

thirty (30) calendar days and will notify a member of the Historic Preservation Advisory
Commission, which will take responsibility for the documentation.
(2) Documentation will include, at minimum, exterior photographs (both black-and-white and color

Preservation Advisory Commission and City Council when determining the historic appropriateness of any
application pertaining to Historic Landmark properties:
1. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to
the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
2. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.

right shall be retained and preserved.
5. Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize
a property shall be preserved.

and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials, replacement of missing features shall be
substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.

be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.

resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 990
9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that

the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its
environment.
10. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would
be unimpaired.

length of eighteen feet (18'), in accordance with Table 1. If the stall is perpendicular to a curb, the length
shall be measured from the curb face. Each parking stall shall have independent access from a driving
aisle. A parking stall may contain less than eighteen feet (18') of pavement in length if all of the following
conditions are met:
a. The stall has a standard six-inch (6") curb face that will allow vehicles to extend over a landscaped area
of no less than six feet (6') in total width;
b. Each stall contains no less than sixteen feet (16') of pavement in length measured from curb face;
c. No pedestrian pathway or landscaping that prevents a standard vehicle from overhanging the curb is
within two feet (2') of any curb face; and
d. All other requirements of the City Code are met.

drive-in stacking lanes, shopping cart storage areas, or areas in front of overhead service doors.
Designated loading spaces shall not encroach into any fire lane or pedestrian pathway.
3. Separation from rights-of-way. Except as provided above, wheel or bumper guards shall be placed in
parking stalls where necessary to prevent any part of a standard sized vehicle from extending beyond a
parking stall boundary line, intruding on a pedestrian way, or contacting any wall, fence, or planting. A
physical separation or barrier, such as vertical curbs, may be required in order to separate parking stalls
from access to a second travel lane.
4. Layout. All off-street parking stalls shall be designed in accordance with the dimensions and specifications
set forth in Table 1 and Table 2 herein.

22-15-5. Parking Modification.
A. Criteria for Parking Deferral. The approving authority of a site plan may defer the construction of up to
seventy-five percent (75%) of the off-street parking stalls required by this Article if an applicant demonstrates
that the full amount of required parking is not needed for the site because:
1. The character of the use lowers the anticipated need for off-street parking as determined from data from
similar uses and/or standards of the Institute of Traffic Engineers applicable to the proposed use; or
2. The use is immediately accessible to public transportation that serves a significant proportion of residents,
employees, or customers who would otherwise use parking spaces at the site; or
3. A significant number of residents, employees, customers and/or other individuals who would normally use
parking spaces at the site regularly walk or use bicycle or other nonmotorized vehicular forms of
transportation.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
B. Site Plan. Applicants for a parking deferral shall submit a site plan demonstrating that the total required
parking can be accommodated on-site, and shall record a plat with the Utah County Recorder’s Office
designating the land to be reserved for future parking. The entire area included in the parking deferral shall be
developed and maintained in landscaping; this landscaping may not be counted toward the landscaping
requirement elsewhere in this Chapter.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
C. Notice of Change of Condition. Any person having an interest in property subject to a parking deferral shall
notify the Director of Development Services of any change in the circumstances that the approving authority
considered in granting the deferral.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
D. Revocation of Parking Deferral. The entity which granted a parking deferral may revoke the deferral in whole
or in part upon a finding that all or a part of the required parking for the site which was deferred is needed for
the site. The approving authority shall not revoke a deferral until the approving authority has provided the
recipient with ten days written notice, by mail or personal service, of the approving authority’s intent to
consider a revocation of the deferral and has provided the recipient an opportunity to be heard regarding the
grounds for revocation. Upon revocation of the deferral, the recipient of the deferral or the recipient’s
successor or assign shall construct that portion of the deferred parking to which the revocation applies within
120 days of the revocation.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
E. Reduction of Required Parking. The approving authority of a site plan may grant a reduction of up to fifty
percent (50%) in the required number of parking stalls for commercial, industrial, and mixed use
developments, if the applicant presents a parking-traffic study prepared by a traffic engineer, and
demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the expected vehicle use and parking space demand for
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 999
the development will be less than that predicted by the Institute of Transportation Engineers vehicle trip
generation rates or less than minimum City parking requirements because:
1. The site incorporates a mix of office or retail uses with assembly and occupancy type uses identified in
Section 22-15-4(F) which reduces the need for parking spaces because of shared parking; or
2. The site is adjacent to a mass transit route and the applicant provides a transit stop and related Amenities,
including a public plaza, pedestrian sitting areas, and additional landscaping (not to exceed 25% of the
total area dedicated as a transit stop); and
3. It is demonstrated that the use of alternative modes of transportation, including mass transit, bicycles, and
walking by customers, clients, or employees of the development will reduce the need for parking space.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
22-15-6. Pedestrian Access.
All sites in commercial zones which either have more than six hundred feet (600') of street frontage or are located
adjacent to a mass transit stop shall include a pedestrian pathway extending from the public right-of-way across
any required landscaping to the parking lot or sidewalk.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
22-15-7. Bicycle Parking.
A. Required Parking Spaces: Bicycle parking spaces shall be required in all zones for each site to which this
Article applies. The number of bicycle parking spaces to be provided shall be three or a number equal to ten
percent (10%) of the required on-site automobile parking spaces, whichever is greater. The total number of
bicycle parking spaces required by this Article shall not exceed thirty (30) spaces per building. Exception: The
Director of Development Services may reduce or waive the bicycle parking requirements for developments
that, in the opinion of the Director of Development Services, are not likely to attract bicycle traffic because of
the nature, location or other circumstances associated with the development. Developments that are not
likely to attract bicycle traffic include, but are not limited to, a car wash and personal storage units.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001; Ord. No. O-03-0025, Amended, 08/05/2003; Ord. No. O-

22-15-8. Reserved.
22-15-9. Interior Landscaping.
A. Required Landscaping. All off-street parking areas that contain ten (10) or more parking stalls, shall include
interior landscaping as required by this Section. The requirements of this Section shall also apply to
expansions of existing parking lots, including both the expanded parking area and the pre-existing parking
area. Paving of a gravel, nonconforming parking area that does not increase the land area utilized for parking
is not considered an expansion.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
B. Landscaped End-Islands. All parking areas subject to the requirements of this Section shall include landscaped
islands, no smaller than eight feet (8') wide, at both ends of at least every other row of parking that is within
seventy-five feet (75') of a dedicated street right-of-way, to delineate all on-site driving aisles. Each island shall
contain at least one (1) deciduous tree. However, when the landscaped island is within fifty feet (50') of a
dedicated street right-of-way or storefront, no trees shall be required in that island.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
C. Trees. Interior landscaping shall include deciduous trees at a minimum rate of one (1) tree for every three
thousand (3,000) square feet of paved area on the site.
(Ord. No. O-01-0005, Enacted, 2/13/2001; O-01-0021, Amended, 06/12/2001)
D. Large Parking Zone Landscaping Requirement. Parking zones containing more than fifty (50) stalls but less
than seventy-five (75) stalls shall include a minimum of five percent (5%) of the parking zone area as interior
landscaping. Parking zones containing at least seventy-five (75) stalls but less than one-hundred (100) stalls
shall include a minimum of seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the parking zone area as interior landscaping.
Parking zones containing 100 or more stalls shall include a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the parking zone
area as interior landscaping. Areas landscaped pursuant to the requirements of other sections of this Article
may be counted toward fulfilling the requirements of this Section. No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of
the interior landscaping required by this Section shall be located adjacent to a building.

The purpose of this section is to provide areas within the City that encourage high density apartment
developments that incorporate creative architectural designs, innovative and attractive landscaped areas, and
Amenities that meet the needs of prospective tenants while contributing to the development project. Because
this Article allows a higher density development than a planned residential development, more stringent
standards are required. The negative effects of a higher density development are reduced and mitigated by
requiring a quality development that is beautifully designed, creatively landscaped, and aesthetically pleasing.

district in a public hearing. Notice of the hearing before the City Council shall be given to the applicant and to the

discretion of the City Council and may be less than that requested by the applicant. In determining the
appropriate reimbursement fee, the City Council shall consider the reasonable cost of the improvement including
construction and land costs and other expenses directly related to the completion of the improvement. The City
may also consider the expected useful life of the improvement, the necessity of the improvement for
development of the parcels in the district, prior contributions by property owners, the proportionate benefit
received by each parcel in the district compared to the benefit received by all parcels served by the improvement,
the intensity of use of the improvement by each parcel served by the improvement, and any other factors that the
City Council deems appropriate. The amount to be reimbursed shall be reduced by the amount of any grants or
other funding for the improvement received from any governmental or quasi-governmental entity. In no event
shall the total amount of the reimbursement fees exceed the actual cost of the improvement. No reimbursement
fees shall be collected from property owned by the applicant. If the scope of the project is altered during
construction in order to respond to events or circumstances that arise during construction, the City Council may
increase the amount of reimbursement by not more than ten percent (10%) without notice to the affected
property owners.

22-24-1. City Center District (CCD) Zone.
A. Purpose.
The City Center District (CCD) zones are intended to be the heart of civic and employment activity in Orem, while
providing opportunity for the development of a traditional downtown center with a mix of office, retail, and
residential uses.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0022, Enacted, 06/19/2018)
Effective on: 6/19/2018
B. Boundaries of City Center District Zones.
There is hereby established five City Center District zones which consist of the following zones: (1) CCD-C (Core),
(2) CCD-E (Edge), (3) CCD-Civ (Civic), (4) CCD-Res-A (Residential) and CCD-Res-B (Residential). Where used in this
Section 22-24-1, the term “CCD zones” refers to all five of the above-referenced zones. Although the CCD zones
have many of the same standards in common, each CCD zone is a fully independent and separate zone. The
boundaries of each of the five City Center zones are as shown in the map below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1038
(Ord. No. O-2018-0022, Enacted, 06/19/2018)
Effective on: 6/19/2018
C. Use of Certain Terms.
Use of Certain Terms. As used in this Section 22-24-1, the terms listed below shall have the following meanings:
1. “Required Sidewalk” or “Sidewalk Adjacent to a Street” means the buffered sidewalk required by Orem City
Code Section 22-8-8(B)(4) or sidewalks required by other applicable sections of the Orem City Code.
2. A “street-facing façade” is any building elevation that faces a public street and is located within one hundred
feet of a required sidewalk. For purposes of this definition, a building elevation faces a public street if any part
of the elevation is visible from the street at a point on a line between the building and the street that is
perpendicular to the street.

D. Default Standards.
Default Standards. With respect to the CCD-C, CCD-E and CCD-Civ zones, the standards of the C2 zone (including
the “Zone Development Standards for the State Street Corridor Area” where applicable) shall apply to any
regulation not specifically addressed in this Section 22-24-1. With respect to the CCD-Res (A & B) zones, the
standards of the PRD zone shall apply to any regulation not specifically addressed in this Section 22-24-1. To the
extent there is any conflict between the standards contained in this Section 22-24-1 and other provisions of the
City Code, the provisions of this Section 22-24-1 shall control.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0022, Enacted, 06/19/2018; Ord. No. O-2018-0032, Amended, 12/11/2018; Ord. No. O-2019-0007, Amended
3/26/2019)
Effective on: 6/19/2018
E. Uses.
1. Permitted Uses. All uses permitted in the C2 zone as well as SLU Code 1112 (Condominiums) and 1120
(Apartments) are permitted in the CCD-C, CCD-E and CCD-Civ zones (subject to the limitation on residential
uses outlined below). All uses permitted in the PRD zone as well as SLU Code 1112 (Condominiums) and 1120
(Apartments) are permitted in the CCD-Res-(A&B) zones. However, no stacked units are allowed in the CCDRes-
B zone.
2. Prohibited Uses. Any use that is not included as a permitted use in subsection (1) above is prohibited in all of
the CCD zones.
3. Limitation on Residential Use. In order to encourage the development of commercial uses in the CCD-C and
CCD-E zones, residential uses in any building shall not occupy more than 80% of the Gross Leasable Floor Area
(GLFA) of such building in the CCD-C zone, or 90% of the GLFA in the CCD-E Zone.
a. In the CCD-C and CCD-E zones, if at least 50% of a parcel’s street frontage is occupied by buildings that
meet the maximum setback requirement of subsection (F)(2) below and have pedestrian access to the
street at ground level, a building on the interior of the parcel may exceed the maximum residential GLFA
limit by an amount equal to the amount (in square feet) by which the residential GLFA of buildings
meeting the maximum setback requirement on the same parcel is below the maximum residential GLFA
allowed in such buildings. This transfer of allowable residential occupancy may only be made to interior
buildings and buildings with street frontage may in no case exceed the maximum residential GLFA
requirement. Any such transfer shall be recorded upon a plat and recorded at the office of the Utah
County Recorder. Upon, the execution of such a transfer of allowable residential occupancy, residential
uses in the building that transferred a portion of its allowable residential use percentage shall not exceed
the maximum percentage of GLFA allowed by the applicable zone less the amount of residential GLFA that
was transferred to another building. For example, if a parcel in the CCD-C zone has two buildings that
each contain 50,000 square feet of GLFA and at least 50% of the street frontage of said parcel is occupied
by a building that meets the maximum setback requirements, the interior building could be 100%
occupied by residential uses provided that no more than 30,000 square feet of GLFA of the building
fronting the street was occupied by residential uses and the transfer of 10,000 square feet of residential
occupancy from the building with street frontage to the building on the interior of the lot was shown on a
plat recorded with the Utah County Recorder. Following the transfer, residential uses in the building with
street frontage could not exceed 30,000 square feet of GLFA ((80% x 50,000)-10,000 (transferred) =
30,000).
b. A transfer of residential occupancy as described above is permanent unless modified by the owners of
both buildings by an amended plat. If a parcel on which a transfer described above has taken place is
subdivided, all buildings on the new parcels shall continue to meet the requirements with respect to
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1040
maximum percentage of GFLA that may be occupied by residential uses to which they were subject prior
to the subdivision.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0022, Enacted, 06/19/2018; Ord. No. O-2018-0032, Amended, 12/11/2018)
Effective on: 6/19/2018
F. Design Standards.
1. Building Height. All buildings in the CCD-C zone shall be at least three (3) stories in height. All buildings in the
CCD-E, CCD-Civ, and CCD-Res-A zones shall be at least two (2) stories in height. Each building story above the
ground story shall be designed and constructed to have at least 60% of the Gross Leasable Floor Area of the
story directly below. Buildings in the CCD-Res-B zone shall have a maximum height of 35 feet. There is no
maximum height requirement for the CCD-C, CCD-E, CCD-Res-A, and CCD-Civ zones. The ground story of every
building, except for buildings in the CCD-Res-(A&B) zones, shall have a floor to ceiling height of at least 14 feet.
A ground floor story in the CCD-CIV zone that has an average floor to ceiling height of 18 feet or more shall
count as two (2) stories toward the minimum story requirement.
2. Setbacks.
Except as otherwise provided below, there are no minimum setbacks in the CCD zones.
a. Maximum Setbacks. Except as otherwise provided herein, the ground level story of all buildings shall be
set back no more than ten feet from the back of a required sidewalk. However, buildings may be set back
an additional ten feet (for a total of twenty feet) from the back of a required sidewalk if the entire
additional setback area is utilized as a “space open to the public” such as a plaza or outdoor dining area
that is designed to be utilized by the public on a regular basis. A “space open to the public” as described
herein must meet the definition provided in Section 22-2-1. An illustration of the maximum setback as well
as the additional ten foot setback for a space open to the public is provided below.
b. Prohibited Uses of Setback Area. The area of any setback from a required sidewalk may not be used for
parking, parking lot driveways, drive-thrus, or drive-thru stacking.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1041
c. Setback From Residentially Zoned Property. No portion of any building (including roofs and parapets) in
the CCD zones may be located closer to a residentially zoned property not a part of the CCD zones than the
height of that portion of the building. Note: The width of adjacent public right-of-way may be included
when measuring setbacks to calculate maximum permitted building heights.
d. Exception to Maximum Setback Requirement. Except as otherwise provided herein, no building may be
constructed on a lot that has frontage on a public street unless the building complies with the maximum
setback requirements set forth above.
i. Notwithstanding the above, a building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may be
constructed on a parcel if at least 50% of that parcel’s street frontage is occupied by a building(s)
facade that is located within twenty feet (20’) of the back of required sidewalk.
ii. A lot where less than fifty percent (50%) of the street frontage is occupied by a building(s) facade
located within twenty feet (20') of the back of required sidewalk may not be subdivided in such way
that creates a new lot. (1) that has no street frontage, or (2) where the percentage of the street
frontage of the original lot included in the new lot is less than the percentage of the area of the
original lot included in the new lot. For example, if a lot has 200 feet of street frontage and 40,000
square feet of area, a lot that is subdivided off the original lot that has 50 feet of street frontage (25%
of the total frontage of the original parcel) may not have a total lot area greater than 10,000 square
feet (25% x 40,000). The intent of this requirement is to prevent circumvention of the maximum
setback requirement. This example is demonstrated in the following graphics:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1042
iii. The width of one required street access (up to a maximum of thirty feet (30’) may be subtracted from the
total parcel width when calculating the 50% frontage occupancy requirement.
iv. A building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may be constructed before the 50%
frontage occupancy requirement is met provided that buildings that will bring the lot into compliance
with the 50% frontage occupancy requirement are constructed concurrently with the building that does
not meet the maximum setback requirement.
v. The maximum setback requirements do not apply to detached, single-family dwellings.
vi. Where at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the perimeter of a building addition is connected to an
existing building in the CCD-Civ zone, the following exceptions apply:
(i) only forty-five percent (45%) of an applicable building façade is required to comply with the maximum
setback requirement; and
(ii) where the building addition is on a lot that has frontage on both State Street and a State Street
Connector Street, the building addition is only required to comply with the maximum setback (with
respect to 45% of the applicable façade) from either State Street or a State Street Connector Street.
3. Lot Size. All lots within the CCD zones shall be a minimum of 7,500 square feet in area.
4. Architectural Features. All buildings in the CCD-C, CCD-E, CCD-Civ and CCD-Res-A zones shall comply with the
following architectural requirements.
a. Vertical Façade Articulation. All street-facing facades shall have a vertical break at least every fifty feet
with a minimum depth of one foot. The required vertical breaks shall extend over at least 75% of the
height of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1043
b. Horizontal Expression Lines. Except for structures in the CCD-RES (B) zone, all street-facing facades shall
incorporate horizontal expression lines in their architecture to delineate the ground story from any upper
stories. Such expression lines shall include a cornice and/or a protrusion in materials with a minimum
depth of six inches. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1044
c. Stepbacks. The façade of the second story and all stories above shall be stepped back at least 20 feet
behind the façade of the first story if all of the following apply:
i. The building is four stories or more in height.
ii. The building is designed for residential uses above the first story.
iii. The building is within 35 feet of a required sidewalk. Where the second story is set back at least twenty
feet behind the façade of the first story as required by this subsection, at least seventy-five percent of
the open roof area of the first story shall be designed for and employed as an amenity for the
residential occupants of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1045
5. Materials.
a. Except as otherwise provided, all buildings shall be completed on all sides with brick, split-face block, glass,
stone, and wood (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 1 Materials”). Aluminum composite material panel
systems, stucco, and Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS) (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 2
Materials”) shall only be permitted as trim on ground-level façades and shall only be allowed on up to a
maximum of 20% of a street-facing façade and up to a maximum of 75% of a non-street facing façade.
b. Standing seam metal (but no other metals) may be used for awnings. Sheet metal and corrugated metal
and other metal finishes are only permitted for soffits, fascia, and similar minor architectural features (less
than or equal to 5% coverage on any given elevation).
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1046
6. Entrances.
a. All primary buildings in the CCD-C, CCD-E and CCD-Civ zones shall have at least one entrance intended for
public, daily customer, and/or resident use oriented toward a public street, public open space, or a
privately-owned “space open to the public”, with first priority assigned to State Street, and second priority
assigned to all other public streets.
b. Lots within the CCD-C zone with frontage on both State Street and Center Street shall have an entrance on
the corner where the two streets meet. However, this requirement shall not apply for building additions
that meet the elements of subsection 22-24-1(F)(2)(d)(vi).
c. Corner entrances at street intersections are encouraged throughout the CCD zones. An example of a
desirable corner entrance is shown in the following image
7. Windows and Awnings. Each street-facing, ground story façade shall have a minimum percentage of
transparent window coverage that is readily visible to a depth of at least five feet into the building. These
percentage requirements vary within the CCD zones as shown in the table below. All awnings shall be durable
canvas or standing seam metal. Plastic awnings are not permitted.

square feet shall be provided for at least fifty (50) percent of all residential units per building in the CCD-C,
CCD-E, CCD-Civ and CCD-Res-A zones. Balconies may be inset into the building or may project over City
sidewalk right-of-way a maximum of five (5) feet so long as fourteen (14) feet of vertical clearance is provided
between the sidewalk and the balcony. Balconies that don’t face a public street shall be set back at least eight
feet from any adjacent property line.
9. Drive-thru Structures.
a. Drive-thru canopy structures (such as a Drive-Thru ATM canopy) shall be located only on the rear or a nonstreet
facing façade(s) of a building.
Drive-thru windows, aisles, and vehicle stacking for drive-thrus are not permitted on any street-facing
façade and/or within any street-facing setback areas.
10. Screening.
a. Trash storage containers (but not including trash cans associated with individual units in the CCD-Res-(B)
zone) and dumpsters shall be completely screened from public view with a masonry wall at least seven
feet in height with sight-obscuring gates which must be located either behind, on a non-street facing side,
or interior to a building.

11. Lighting.
a. Each site (except for development in the CCD-Res-(B) shall include a Lighting Plan that is designed to
discourage crime, enhance safety, and prevent direct glare onto adjacent properties.
12. Open Space.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1048
a. All lots with a residential use component shall have a minimum twenty percent (20%) of the lot area
dedicated to open space (excluding required public sidewalks and planter strips). This requirement may be
fulfilled with standard “open space” or with a “space open to the public” or a combination of both.
However, a minimum of 10% of the lot’s area shall be maintained as a “space open to the public” (see
Section 22-2-1 for definitions of “open space” and “spaces open to the public”). This requirement shall not
apply to the CCD-Res-(B) zone.
b. Commercial lots without a residential use component are not required to provide any type of “open
space” (apart from the required sidewalks, planter strips and other required landscaping). However, if a

G. Transportation.
1. Streets.
Private streets are not permitted in the CCD zones. However private pedestrian promenades, driveways,
vehicular accesses, and alleyways are permitted provided proper fire access is maintained throughout the
site.
3. Driveways and Accesses.
a. Vehicular accesses shall be no more than thirty feet wide unless the Planning Commission finds, based
on a traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City
Transportation Engineer, that a wider access is necessary for the site. In no event shall an access
exceed forty (40) feet in width.
b. No more than one access shall be allowed per lot unless the Planning Commission find, based on a
traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City
Transportation Engineer, that more than one access is needed for development on the lot.
c. Where a driveway crosses a public sidewalk, the driveway shall be a different stained color, texture, or
paving material than the sidewalk to warn drivers of the possibility of pedestrians in the area (see
Figure 9 below). This requirement shall not apply in the CCD-Res-B zone.

City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1050
3. Traffic Study.
A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) shall be required in connection with any site plan in the CCD zones that is not a minor
amendment as defined in Section 22-14-20(C)(3)(b). The provisions of Section 22-14-20(E)(8)(a-c) shall apply to
any required TIS. The TIS shall evaluate the vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic both on site and in the general
vicinity of the project. The TIS shall evaluate trip generations, turning movements to and from the property, street
and roundabout geometrics, and traffic safety on and off the site. The TIS shall also address relevant items
including but not limited to the following: surrounding street and intersection levels of service (LOS) before and
after the project is completed, any mitigation efforts recommended to minimize project traffic impacts, proposed
public and private street widths and alignments, site mobility, access management, potential traffic signal
locations, street striping, signage, etc. The traffic engineer that performs the required TIS shall meet with the City
Traffic Engineer prior to beginning the TIS to discuss specific areas of focus for the TIS. Each site plan shall reflect
and incorporate the recommendations of the traffic study and any other requirements that the City may deem
necessary based upon the TIS. Any new development or redevelopment shall comply with all recommendations of
the TIS.

H. Parking.
1. Parking Requirements
a. Required parking in the CCD zones may be met within a parking lot, parking structure, or a shared
parking agreement approved by the City.
b. For the “Core”, “Civic”, and “Edge” zones, three parking stalls shall be provided for every one-thousand
(1000) square feet of gross leasable floor area of nonresidential uses. Since any residential use in these
zones is required to be part of a mixed-use development, no parking stalls shall be required for
residential units included within the base residential density. The base residential density is calculated
by dividing the total commercial parking requirement by three (3). For each residential unit in excess
of the base residential density, a minimum of 1.75 parking stalls shall be provided (of which .1 stalls
per unit shall be dedicated to visitor parking).
c. For the CCD-Res (A&B) zones, 2.5 stalls shall be provided for each standard residential unit (less than
three bedrooms and less than 1200 square feet) and 3.5 stalls shall be provided for each large
residential unit (three or more bedrooms or 1200 or more square feet). Where parking areas are
shared between multiple units, parking stalls shall be dedicated to each unit or to visitor parking by
signage or painted numbering and at least 0.5 stalls of the per unit required parking standard shall be
reserved for visitor parking.
d. No Charge for Use of Required Parking. In order to ensure that tenants (including residents and
employees) of a development do not have an incentive to park off-site, no fee charge, deposit or other
form of compensation (other than rent) may be required of a tenant for the right to use required
parking stalls (including, for purposes of this subsection, the right to exclusive use of a particular
parking stall). Neither the rent, the deposit or other fees charged to tenants may differ based on
whether the tenant is given the right to use required parking. No form of compensation (including but
not limited to a reduction in rent or other fees or charges) may be given to a tenant in exchange for a
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1051
waiver or relinquishment of the right to use required parking. No penalty of any kind may be imposed
upon a tenant for parking in a required parking stall.
(Ord. No. 2019-0032, Enacted 10/8/2019)
e. Site plans within the CCD District are not eligible for any parking modifications outlined in Section 22-
15-5 and must meet the parking requirements outlined in this section.
(Ord. No. 2019-0032, Enacted 10/8/2019)
2. Parking Lot Standards. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of Article 22-15 (Off-Street
Parking) shall apply to all development in the CCD zones.
a. Buildings shall be sited to face the street with parking lots on the side or rear. The owner of property in
a CCD zone shall provide cross-access easements to adjoining properties that have parking lots in any
final or amended plat for the property. Any parking lots on the side of a building shall be set back at
least 20 feet from a required sidewalk. The 20 foot parking setback area shall be maintained as “open
space” or a “space open to the public” and shall be maintained with shrubs or other sight-obscuring
features at a minimum height of three feet to screen the parking area from the street.
b. Parking Lot Lighting: Parking lot light poles on properties adjacent to the CCD-Res-B zone and
residential zones outside of the CCD zones shall be no closer than 50 feet to the adjacent residential
property line. Additionally, globes must be shielded and the lighting directed down to minimize light
encroachment onto adjacent properties or into upper level residential units in multi-story buildings.
Lightproof fencing is also required when adjacent to residential properties that are not in a CCD zone.
c. Concrete curbs shall be provided between landscaped areas and off-street parking areas. Low-profile
curbs are permitted to accommodate low-impact developments (LIDs) in all landscaped areas except
for within required planter strips along State Street (see also landscaping requirements in Section 22-
14-13 (C).
3. Parking Structures.
a. The entire street-facing façade(s) of a parking structure must be “wrapped” with a habitable building
designed and constructed for residential or commercial uses. All other facades of a parking structure
shall be wrapped with buildings and/or have an external skin (or screen) designed to improve its visual
appeal. Examples include heavy gauge metal screening, precast concrete panels, laminated or safety
glass, decorative solar panels, or decorative façades. The intent is for parking structures to blend into
surrounding buildings and not look like a parking structure. The Planning Commission may approve
other decorative materials not listed herein if the proposed materials would have an equal or better
aesthetic effect than the approved materials listed herein. All readily visible areas not wrapped with
buildings shall be screened. To the greatest extent possible, uneven levels in parking structures shall
be screened from public view. The following images demonstrate parking structure wrapping:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1052
b. Elevators and stairs shall be highlighted architecturally so visitors, internally and externally, can easily
access these entry points.
c. Any signage attached to the parking structure shall be integrated with the architecture of the parking
structure and be architecturally compatible with the design. Public parking structures entrances shall be
clearly signed from public streets.
d. At a minimum, all street-facing façades of all parking structures shall be wrapped with structures designed
and constructed for a commercial or residential use.
e. Parking structures shall be designed to minimize vehicle noise and odors that emanate on to sidewalks
and “spaces open to the public”. Venting and fan locations shall not be located next to “spaces open to
the public” and are encouraged to be located on top of the parking structure where feasible.
4. Specific use parking exceptions as established in Section 22-15-4 (G) apply in the CCD zones.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1053
5. Parking modifications as established in Section 22-15-5 apply in the CCD zones.
6. Bicycle parking requirements as established in Section 22-15-7 apply in the CCD zones.

I. Signs.
1. Except as otherwise provided herein, all signs in the City Center District zones shall meet the standards
provided in Article 14-3. All areas within the CCD-C, CCD-E, CCD-Civ and CCD-Res-A zones shall be
designated as Sign Zone “H” (14-3-3).
2. Removal of Pole Signs. One of the purposes of the CCD zones is to provide a more attractive environment
for commercial and residential uses. The City has determined that pole signs are less aesthetically
appealing than other types of signs such as monument signs. Therefore, pole signs are not permitted in
the City Center District zones. Any existing pole signs shall be removed in the event that reconstruction is
performed on fifteen percent (15%) or more of the footprint of an existing building on the lot upon which
the pole sign(s) is located, upon the addition or expansion of a building that constitutes fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the existing building footprint on the lot, or upon the construction of a new building on a
lot. Reconstruction occurs where at least 50% of the area of the exterior walls of a portion of the building
footprint consisting of 15% or more of the building footprint is demolished and rebuilt (see figure below).
The removal of existing pole signs required by this section shall occur before the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for the new building or building expansion.

22-24-2. The Hub District (HD) Zone.
A. Purpose.
The Hub District (HD) zone is intended to be the center of commercial activity in Orem, filled with vibrant
shopping, restaurants, and entertainment destinations.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
B. Boundaries of The Hub District Zone.
The Hub District (HD) zone is hereby established. The boundaries of the HD zone are shown in the map below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1055
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1056
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
C. Use of Certain Terms.
As used in this Section 22-24-2, the terms listed below shall have the following meanings:
1. “Required Sidewalk” or “Sidewalk Adjacent to a Street” means the buffered sidewalk required by Orem City
Code Section 22-8-8(B)(4) or sidewalks required by other applicable sections of the Orem City Code.
2. A “street-facing façade” is any building elevation that faces a public street and is located within one hundred
feet of a required sidewalk. For purposes of this definition, a building elevation faces a public street if any part
of the elevation is visible from the street at a point on a line between the building and the street that is
perpendicular to the street.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
D. Default Standards.
The standards of the C2 zone (including the “Zone Development Standards for the State Street Corridor Area”
where applicable) shall apply in the HD zone with respect to any regulation not otherwise specifically addressed in
this Section 22-24-2.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
E. Uses.
1. Permitted Uses. All uses permitted in the C2 zone as well as SLU Code 1112 (Condominiums) and 1120
(Apartments) are permitted in the HD zone (subject to the limitation on residential uses outlined below).
2. Prohibited Uses. Any use that is not included as a permitted use in subsection (1) above is prohibited in the
HD zone.
3. Limitation on Residential Use. In order to encourage the development of commercial uses in the HD zone,
residential uses in any building shall not occupy more than the 80% of the Gross Leasable Floor Area (GLFA) of
such building.
a. If at least 50% of a parcel’s street frontage is occupied by buildings that meet the maximum setback
requirement of subsection (F)(2) below and have pedestrian access to the street at ground level, a building
on the interior of the parcel may exceed the maximum residential GLFA limit by an amount equal to the
amount (in square feet) by which the residential GLFA of buildings meeting the maximum setback
requirement on the same parcel is below the maximum residential GLFA allowed in such buildings. This
transfer of allowable residential occupancy may only be made to interior buildings and buildings with
street frontage may in no case exceed the maximum residential GLFA requirement. Any such transfer shall
be recorded upon a plat and recorded at the office of the Utah County Recorder. Upon, the execution of
such a transfer of allowable residential occupancy, residential uses in the building that transferred a
portion of its allowable residential use percentage shall not exceed the maximum percentage of GLFA
allowed by the applicable zone less the amount of residential GLFA that was transferred to another
building. For example, if a parcel in the HD zone has two buildings that each contain 50,000 square feet of
GLFA and at least 50% of the street frontage of said parcel is occupied by a building that meets the
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1057
maximum setback requirements, the interior building could be 100% occupied by residential uses provided
that no more than 30,000 square feet of GLFA of the building fronting the street was occupied by
residential uses and the transfer of 10,000 square feet of residential occupancy from the building with
street frontage to the building on the interior of the lot was shown on a plat recorded with the Utah
County Recorder. Following the transfer, residential uses in the building with street frontage could not
exceed 30,000 square feet of GLFA ((80% x 50,000)-10,000 (transferred) = 30,000).
b. A transfer of residential occupancy as described above is permanent unless modified by the owners of
both buildings by an amended plat. If a parcel on which a transfer described above has taken place is
subdivided, all buildings on the new parcels shall continue to meet the requirements with respect to
maximum percentage of GFLA that may be occupied by residential uses to which they were subject prior
to the subdivision.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
F. Design Standards.
1. Building Height. All buildings in the HD zone shall have a minimum of three (3) stories. Each building story
above the ground story shall be designed and constructed to have at least 60% of the Gross Leasable Floor
Area of the story directly below. There is no maximum height requirement for the HD zone. The ground story
of every building, shall have a minimum floor to ceiling height of at least 14 feet.
2. Setbacks. Except as otherwise provided below, there are no minimum setbacks in the HD zone.
a. Maximum Setbacks. Except as otherwise provided herein, the ground level story of all buildings shall be
set back no more than ten feet from the back of a required sidewalk. However, buildings may be set back
an additional ten feet (for a total of twenty feet) from the back of a required sidewalk if the entire
additional setback area is utilized as a “space open to the public” such as a plaza or outdoor dining area
that is designed to be utilized by the public on a regular basis. A “space open to the public” as described
herein must meet the definition provided in Section 22-2-1. An illustration of the maximum setback as well
as the additional ten foot setback for a space open to the public is provided below.
b. Prohibited Uses of Setback Area. The area of any setback from a required sidewalk may not be used for
parking, parking lot driveways, drive-thrus, or drive-thru stacking.
c. Setback From Residentially Zoned Property. No portion of any building (including roofs and parapets) in
the HD zone may be located closer to a residentially zoned property not a part of the HD zone than the
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1058
height of that portion of the building. Note: The width of adjacent public right-of-way may be included
when measuring setbacks to calculate maximum permitted building heights.
Illustration of stepping-back of building height when next to residential zones
d. Exception to Maximum Setback Requirement. Except as otherwise provided herein, no building may be
constructed on a lot that has frontage on a public street unless the building complies with the maximum
setback requirements set forth above.
i. Notwithstanding the above, a building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may
be constructed on a parcel if at least 50% of that parcel’s street frontage is occupied by a building(s)
façade that is located within twenty feet (20’) of the back of required sidewalk.
ii. A lot where less than fifty percent (50%) of the street frontage is occupied by a building(s) facade
located within twenty feet (20’) of the back of required sidewalk may not be subdivided in such way
that creates a new lot (1) that has no street frontage, or (2) where the percentage of the street
frontage of the original lot included in the new lot is less than the percentage of the area of the
original lot included in the new lot. For example, if a lot has 200 feet of street frontage and 40,000
square feet of area, a lot that is subdivided off the original lot that has 50 feet of street frontage (25%
of the total frontage of the original parcel) may not have a total lot area greater than 10,000 square
feet (25% x 40,000). The intent of this requirement is to prevent circumvention of the maximum
setback requirement. This example is demonstrated in the following graphics:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1059
iii. The width of one required street access (up to a maximum of thirty feet (30’) may be subtracted
from the total parcel width when calculating the 50% frontage occupancy requirement.
iv. A building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may be constructed before
the 50% frontage occupancy requirement is met provided that buildings that will bring the lot
into compliance with the 50% frontage occupancy requirement are constructed concurrently
with the building that does not meet the maximum setback requirement.
3. Lot Size. All lots within the HD zone shall be a minimum of 7,500 square feet in area.
4. Architectural Features. All buildings in the HD zone shall comply with the following architectural
requirements.
a. Vertical Façade Articulation. The architecture of all street-facing facades shall have a vertical break at
least every fifty feet with a minimum depth of one foot. The required vertical breaks shall extend over at
least 75% of the height of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1060
b. Horizontal Expression Lines. All street-facing facades shall incorporate horizontal expression lines in their
architecture to delineate the ground story from any upper stories. Such expression lines shall include a
cornice and/or a protrusion in materials with a minimum depth of six inches. An illustration of this
requirement is provided below:
c. Stepbacks. The façade of the second story and all stories above shall be stepped back at least 20 feet
behind the façade of the first story if all of the following apply:
i. The building is four stories or more in height.
ii. The building is designed for residential uses above the first story.
iii. The building is within 35 feet of a sidewalk adjacent to a street. Where the second story is set back at
least twenty feet behind the façade of the first story as required by this subsection, at least seventy-five
percent of the open roof area of the first story shall be designed for and employed as an amenity for
the residential occupants of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1061
5. Materials.
a. Except as otherwise provided, all buildings shall be completed on all sides with brick, split-face block, glass,
stone, and wood (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 1 Materials”). Aluminum composite material panel
systems, stucco, and Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS) (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 2
Materials”) shall only be permitted as trim on ground-level façades and shall only be allowed on up to a
maximum of 20% total coverage on street-facing façades and up to a maximum of 75% of a non-street
facing façade.
b. Standing seam metal (but no other metals) may be used for awnings. Sheet metal and corrugated metal
and other metal finishes are only permitted for soffits, fascia, and similar minor architectural features (less
than or equal to 5% coverage on any given elevation).
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1062
6. Entrances.
a. All primary buildings in the HD zone shall have at least one entrance intended for public, daily customer,
and/or resident use oriented toward a public street, public open space, or a privately-owned “space open
to the public”, with first priority assigned to State Street, and second priority assigned to all other public
streets.
b. Lots within the HD zone with frontage on both State Street and University Parkway shall have an entrance
on the corner where the two streets meet.
c. Corner entrances at street intersections are encouraged throughout the HD zone. An example of a
desirable corner entrance is shown in the following image:
7. Windows and Awnings. At least 70% of each street-facing, ground story façade shall consist of transparent
window coverage that is readily visible to a depth of at least five feet into the building. All awnings shall be
durable canvas or standing seam metal. Plastic awnings are not permitted.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1063
8. Balconies. Balconies consisting of a minimum area of fifty (50) square feet shall be provided for at least fifty
(50) percent of all residential units per building in the HD zone. Balconies may be inset into the building or
may project over City sidewalk a maximum of five feet so long as fourteen (14) feet of vertical clearance is
provided between the sidewalk and the balcony. Balconies that don’t face a public street shall be set back at
least eight feet from any adjacent property line.

a. Trash storage containers and dumpsters shall be completely screened from public view with a masonry
wall at least seven feet in height with sight-obscuring gates which must be located either behind, on a
non-street facing side, or interior to a building.
b. All electrical, utility, and mechanical equipment (including equipment on roofs) shall be fully screened
from public view with sight-obscuring materials. Such equipment must be buried (vaulted) if located
within any front or side street-facing setback areas, or if located within any required planter strip areas.
11. Lighting.
a. Each site shall include a Lighting Plan that is designed to discourage crime, enhance safety, and prevent
direct glare onto adjacent properties.
12. Open Space.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1064
a. All lots with a residential use component shall have a minimum twenty percent (20%) of the lot area
dedicated to open space (excluding required public sidewalks and planter strips). This requirement may be
fulfilled with standard “open space” or with a “space open to the public” or a combination of both.
However, a minimum of 10% of the lot’s area shall be maintained as a “space open to the public” (see
Section 22-2-1 for definitions of “open space” and “spaces open to the public”).
b. Commercial lots without a residential use component are not required to provide any type of “open

G. Transportation.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1065
1. Streets. Private streets are not permitted in the HD zone. However private pedestrian promenades,
driveways, vehicular accesses, and alleyways are permitted provided proper fire access is maintained
throughout the site.
2. Driveways and Accesses.
a. Vehicular accesses shall be no more than thirty feet wide unless the Planning Commission finds, based on
a traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City
Transportation Engineer, that a wider access is necessary for the site. In no event shall an access exceed
forty (40) feet in width.
b. No more than one access shall be allowed per lot unless the Planning Commission finds, based on a traffic
study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City Transportation
Engineer, that more than one access is needed for development on the lot.
c. Where a driveway crosses a public sidewalk, the driveway shall be a different stained color, texture, or
paving material than the sidewalk to warn drivers of the possibility of pedestrians in the area (See Figure 9
below).
d. All adjoining properties are required to share vehicular and pedestrian accesses to public streets and
sidewalks and to provide any necessary cross-access easements to effectuate this sharing.
Fig. 9 stamped and colored asphalt.
3. Traffic Study.
a. A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) shall be required in connection with any site plan in the HD zone that is not a
minor amendment as defined in Section 22-14-20(C)(3)(b). The provisions of Section 22-14-20(E)(8)(a-c)
shall apply to any required TIS. The TIS shall evaluate the vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic both on
site and in the general vicinity of the project. The TIS shall evaluate trip generations, turning movements
to and from the property, street and roundabout geometrics, and traffic safety on and off the site. The TIS
shall also address relevant items including but not limited to the following: surrounding street and
intersection levels of service (LOS) before and after the project is completed, any mitigation efforts
recommended to minimize project traffic impacts, proposed public and private street widths and
alignments, site mobility, access management, potential traffic signal locations, street striping, signage,
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1066
etc. The traffic engineer that performs the required TIS shall meet with the City Traffic Engineer prior to
beginning the TIS to discuss specific areas of focus for the TIS. Each site plan shall reflect and incorporate
the recommendations of the traffic study and any other requirements that the City may deem necessary
based upon the TIS. Any new development or redevelopment shall comply with all recommendations of
the TIS.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
H. Parking.
1. Parking Requirements
a. Required parking in the HD zone may be met within a parking lot, parking structure, or a shared parking
agreement approved by the City.
b. For the HD zone, three parking stalls shall be provided for every one-thousand (1000) square feet of gross
leasable floor area of nonresidential uses. Since any residential use in this zone is required to be part of a
mixed-use development, no parking stalls shall be required for residential units included within the base
residential density. The base residential density is calculated by dividing the total commercial parking
requirement by three (3). For each residential unit in excess of the base residential density, a minimum of
1.75 parking stalls shall be provided (of which .1 stalls per unit shall be dedicated to visitor parking).
c. No Charge for Use of Required Parking. In order to ensure that tenants (including residents and
employees) of a development do not have an incentive to park off-site, no fee charge, deposit or other
form of compensation (other than rent) may be required of a tenant for the right to use required parking
stalls (including, for purposes of this subsection, the right to exclusive use of a particular parking stall).
Neither the rent, the deposit or other fees charged to tenants may differ based on whether the tenant is
given the right to use required parking. No form of compensation (including but not limited to a reduction
in rent or other fees or charges) may be given to a tenant in exchange for a waiver or relinquishment of
the right to use required parking. No penalty of any kind may be imposed upon a tenant for parking in a
required parking stall.
(Ord. No. O-2019-0032, Enacted 10/8/2019)
d. Site plans within the HD District are not eligible for any parking modifications outlined in Section 22-15-5
and must meet the parking requirements outlined in this section.
(Ord. No. O-2019-0032, Enacted 10/8/2019)
2. Parking Lot Standards. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of Article 22-15 (Off-Street
Parking) shall apply to all development in the HD zone.
a. Buildings shall be sited to face the street with parking lots on the side or rear. Adjoining properties that
have neighboring parking lots shall be connected and have cross-access easements established upon final
plat approval. Any parking lots on the side of a building shall be set back at least 20 feet from a sidewalk
adjacent to a street. The 20 foot parking setback area shall be maintained as “open space” or a “space
open to the public” and shall be maintained with shrubs or other sight-obscuring features at a minimum
height of three feet to screen the parking area from the street.
b. Parking Lot Lighting: Parking lot light poles on properties adjacent to residential zones outside of the HD
zone shall be no closer than 50 feet to the adjacent residential property line. Additionally, globes must be
shielded and the lighting directed down to minimize light encroachment onto adjacent properties or into
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1067
upper level residential units in multi-story buildings. Lightproof fencing is also required when adjacent to
residentially properties that are not in a HD zone.
c. Concrete curbs shall be provided between landscaped areas and off-street parking areas. Low-profile
curbs are permitted to accommodate low-impact developments (LIDs) in all landscaped areas except for
within required planter strips along State Street (see also landscaping requirements in Section 22-14-13
(C)).
3. Parking Structures.
a. The street-facing façade of a parking structure must be “wrapped” with a habitable building designed and
constructed for residential or commercial uses. All other facades of a parking structure shall be wrapped
with buildings and/or have an external skin (or screen) designed to improve its visual appeal. Examples
include heavy gauge metal screening, precast concrete panels, laminated or safety glass, decorative solar
panels, or decorative façades. The intent is for parking structures to blend into surrounding buildings and
not look like a parking structure. The Planning Commission may approve other decorative materials not
listed herein if the proposed materials would have an equal or better aesthetic effect than the approved
materials listed herein. All readily visible areas not wrapped with buildings shall be screened. To the
greatest extent possible, uneven levels in parking structures shall be screened from public view. The
following images demonstrate parking structure wrapping:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1068
b. Elevators and stairs shall be highlighted architecturally so visitors, internally and externally, can easily
access these entry points.
c. Any signage attached to the parking structure and wayfinding signage shall be integrated with the
architecture of the parking structure and be architecturally compatible with the design. Public parking
structures entrances shall be clearly signed from public streets.
d. At a minimum, all street-facing façades of all parking structures shall be wrapped with structures designed
and constructed for a commercial or residential use.
e. Parking structures shall be designed to minimize vehicle noise and odors that emanate on to sidewalks
and “spaces open to the public”. Venting and fan locations shall not be located next to “spaces open to
the public” and are encouraged to be located on top of the parking structure where feasible.
4. Specific use parking exceptions as established in Section 22-15-4 (G) apply in the HD Zone.
5. Parking modifications as established in Section 22-15-5 apply in the HD Zone.
6. Bicycle parking requirements as established in Section 22-15-7 apply in the HD Zone.

I. Signs.
1. Except as otherwise provided herein, all signs in the Hub District zone shall meet the standards provided in
Article 14-3. All areas within the HD zone shall be designated as Sign Zone “H” (14-3-3).
2. Removal of Pole Signs. One of the purposes of the HD zone is to provide a more attractive environment for
commercial and residential uses. The City has determined that pole signs are less aesthetically appealing than
other types of signs such as monument signs. Therefore, pole signs are not permitted in the Hub District zone.
Any existing pole signs shall be removed in the event that reconstruction is performed on fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the footprint of an existing building on the lot upon which the pole sign(s) is located, upon
the addition or expansion of a building that constitutes fifteen percent (15%) or more of the existing building
footprint on the lot, or upon the construction of a new building on a lot. The removal of existing pole signs
required by this section shall occur before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the new building or
building expansion.

C. Use of Certain Terms.
As used in this Section 22-24-3, the terms listed below shall have the following meanings:
1. “Required Sidewalk” or “Sidewalk Adjacent to a Street” means the buffered sidewalk required by Orem City
Code Section 22-8-8(B)(4) or sidewalks required by other applicable sections of the Orem City Code.
2. 2. A “street-facing façade” is any building elevation that faces a public street and is located within one
hundred feet of a required sidewalk. For purposes of this definition, a building elevation faces a public street if
any part of the elevation is visible from the street at a point on a line between the building and the street that
is perpendicular to the street.

E. Uses.
1. Permitted Uses. All uses permitted in the C2 zone as well as SLU Code 1112 (Condominiums) and 1120
(Apartments) are permitted in the CXD-C zone (subject to the limitation on residential uses outlined below).
All uses permitted in the PRD zone as well as SLU Code 1112 (Condominiums) and 1120 (Apartments) are
permitted in the CXD-Res-(A&B) zones. However, no stacked units are allowed in the CXD-Res-B zone.
2. Prohibited Uses. Any use that is not included as a permitted use in subsection (1) above is prohibited in all of
the CXD zones.
3. Limitation on Residential Use. In order to encourage the development of commercial uses in the CXD-C zone,
residential uses in any building in the CXD-C zone shall not occupy more than 80% of the Gross Leasable Floor
Area (GLFA) of such building.
a. In the CXD-C zone, if at least 50% of a parcel’s street frontage is occupied by buildings that meet the
maximum setback requirement of subsection (F)(2) below and have pedestrian access to the street at
ground level, a building on the interior of the parcel may exceed the maximum residential GLFA limit by an
amount equal to the amount (in square feet) by which the residential GLFA of buildings meeting the
maximum setback requirement on the same parcel is below the maximum residential GLFA allowed in
such buildings. This transfer of allowable residential occupancy may only be made to interior buildings and
buildings with street frontage may in no case exceed the maximum residential GLFA requirement. Any
such transfer shall be recorded upon a plat and recorded at the office of the Utah County Recorder. Upon,
the execution of such a transfer of allowable residential occupancy, residential uses in the building that
transferred a portion of its allowable residential use percentage shall not exceed the maximum percentage
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1072
of GLFA allowed by the applicable zone less the amount of residential GLFA that was transferred to
another building. For example, if a parcel in the CXD-C zone has two buildings that each contain 50,000
square feet of GLFA and at least 50% of the street frontage of said parcel is occupied by a building that
meets the maximum setback requirements, the interior building could be 100% occupied by residential
uses provided that no more than 30,000 square feet of GLFA of the building fronting the street was
occupied by residential uses and the transfer of 10,000 square feet of residential occupancy from the
building with street frontage to the building on the interior of the lot was shown on a plat recorded with
the Utah County Recorder. Following the transfer, residential uses in the building with street frontage
could not exceed 30,000 square feet of GLFA ((80% x 50,000)-10,000 (transferred) = 30,000).
b. A transfer of residential occupancy as described above is permanent unless modified by the owners of
both buildings by an amended plat. If a parcel on which a transfer described above has taken place is
subdivided, all buildings on the new parcels shall continue to meet the requirements with respect to
maximum percentage of GFLA that may be occupied by residential uses to which they were subject prior
to the subdivision.

Effective on: 10/9/2018
F. Design Standards.
1. Building Height. All buildings in the CXD zones except for buildings in the CXD-Res-B zone shall be at least two
stories in height. Buildings in the CXD-Res-B zone shall have a maximum height of 35 feet. There is no
maximum height requirement for the CXD-C and CXD-RES(A) zones. Each building story above the ground
story shall be designed and constructed to have at least 60% of the Gross Leasable Floor Area of the story
directly below. The ground story of every building, except for buildings in the CXD-Res (A&B) zones, shall have
a floor to ceiling height of at least 14 feet.
a. Exception to Building Height Requirement. One accessory building that does not comply with the
minimum height requirement may be constructed on a parcel provided that the accessory building:
(i) is no larger than forty percent (40%) of the Gross Floor Area (GFA) of (only) one primary building on the
parcel;
(ii) is limited to one story, thirteen (13) feet in height;
(iii) is designed and used exclusively for storage in connection with the primary use of the parcel;
(iv) is an accessory use to the principal use(s) or structure(s) on the parcel;
(v) is located behind the primary structure(s) on the parcel;
(vi) has no connection to water or sewer service;
(vii) is located on a parcel that has not already taken advantage of the “small building addition” exception
under section 22-8-8(B)(7)(a) and is constructed in lieu of said “small building addition” exception--the
“small building addition” exception under section 22-8-8(B)(7)(a) shall not be available for any parcel on
which an accessory building has been constructed pursuant to this subsection (a).
2. Setbacks. Except as otherwise provided below, there are no minimum setbacks in the CXD zones.
a. Maximum Setbacks. Except as otherwise provided herein, the ground level story of all buildings shall be
set back no more than ten feet from the back of a required sidewalk. However, buildings may be set back
an additional ten feet (for a total of twenty feet) from the back of a required sidewalk if the entire
additional setback area is utilized as a “space open to the public” such as a plaza or outdoor dining area
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1073
that is designed to be utilized by the public on a regular basis. A “space open to the public” as described
herein must meet the definition provided in Section 22-2-1. An illustration of the maximum setback as well
as the additional ten foot setback for a space open to the public is provided below.
b. Prohibited Uses of Setback Area. The area of any setback from a required sidewalk may not be used for
parking, parking lot driveways, drive-thrus, or drive-thru stacking.
c. Setback From Residentially Zoned Property. No portion of any building (including roofs and parapets) in
the CXD zones may be located closer to a residentially zoned property not a part of the CXD zones than
the height of that portion of the building. Note: The width of adjacent public right-of-way may be included
when measuring setbacks to calculate maximum permitted building heights.
Illustration of stepping-back of building height when next to residential zones
d. Exceptions to Maximum Setback Requirement. Except as otherwise provided herein, no building may be
constructed on a lot that has frontage on a public street unless the building complies with the maximum
setback requirements set forth above.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1074
i. Notwithstanding the above, a building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may
be constructed on a parcel if at least 50% of that parcel’s street frontage is occupied by a building(s)
façade that is located within twenty feet (20’) of the back of required sidewalk.
ii. A lot where less than fifty percent (50%) of the street frontage is occupied by a building(s) facade
located within twenty feet (20’) of the back of required sidewalk may not be subdivided in such way
that creates a new lot (1) that has no street frontage, or (2) where the percentage of the street
frontage of the original lot included in the new lot is less than the percentage of the area of the
original lot included in the new lot. For example, if a lot has 200 feet of street frontage and 40,000
square feet of area, a lot that is subdivided off the original lot that has 50 feet of street frontage (25%
of the total frontage of the original parcel) may not have a total lot area greater than 10,000 square
feet (25% x 40,000). The intent of this requirement is to prevent circumvention of the maximum
setback requirement.
This example is demonstrated in the following graphics:
iii. The width of one required street access (up to a maximum of thirty feet (30’)) may be subtracted
from the total parcel width when calculating the 50% frontage occupancy requirement.
iv. A building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may be constructed before the
50% frontage occupancy requirement is met provided that buildings that will bring the lot into
compliance with the 50% frontage occupancy requirement are constructed concurrently with the
building that does not meet the maximum setback requirement.
v. The maximum setback requirements do not apply to detached, single-family dwellings.
vi. One accessory building that does not comply with the maximum setback requirement may be
constructed on a parcel provided that the accessory building:
(i) is no larger than forty percent (40%) of the GFA of (only) one primary building on the parcel;
(ii) is limited to one story, thirteen (13) feet in height;
(iii) is designed and used exclusively for storage in connection with the primary use of the parcel;
(iv) is an accessory use to the principal use(s) or structure(s) on the parcel;
(v) is located behind the primary structure(s) on the parcel;
(vi) has no connection to water or sewer service;
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1075
(vii) is located on a parcel that has not already taken advantage of the “small building addition”
exception under section 22-8-8(B)(7)(a) and is constructed in lieu of said “small building addition”
exception--the “small building addition” exception under section 22-8-8(B)(7)(a) shall not be
available for any parcel on which an accessory building has been constructed pursuant to this
subsection (a).
3. Lot Size. All lots within the CXD zones shall be a minimum of 7,500 square feet in area.
4. Architectural Features. All buildings in the CXD-C and CXD-Res-A zones shall comply with the following
architectural requirements.
a. Vertical Façade Articulation. The architecture of all street-facing facades shall have a vertical break at
least every fifty feet with a minimum depth of one foot. The required vertical breaks shall extend over at
least 75% of the height of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
b. Horizontal Expression Lines. Except for structures in the CXD-RES(B) zone, all street-facing facades shall
incorporate horizontal expression lines in their architecture to delineate the ground story from any upper
stories. Such expression lines shall include a cornice and/or a protrusion in materials with a minimum
depth of six inches. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1076
c. Stepbacks. The façade of the second story and all stories above shall be stepped back at least 20 feet
behind the façade of the first story if all of the following apply:
i. The building is four stories or more in height.
ii. The building is designed for residential uses above the first story.
iii. The building is within 35 feet of a sidewalk adjacent to a street. Where the second story is set back at
least twenty feet behind the façade of the first story as required by this subsection, at least seventyfive
percent of the open roof area of the first story shall be designed for and employed as an amenity
for the residential occupants of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1077
5. Materials.
a. Except as otherwise provided, all buildings shall be completed on all sides with brick, split-face block, glass,
stone, and wood (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 1 Materials”). Aluminum composite material panel
systems, stucco, and Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS) (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 2
Materials”) shall only be permitted as trim on ground-level façades and shall only be allowed on up to a
maximum of 20% of a street-facing façade and up to a maximum of 75% of a non-street facing façade.
b. Standing seam metal (but no other metals) may be used for awnings. Sheet metal and corrugated metal
and other metal finishes are only permitted for soffits, fascia, and similar minor architectural features (less
than or equal to 5% coverage on any given elevation).
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1078
6. Entrances.
a. All primary buildings in the CXD-C zone shall have at least one entrance intended for public, daily
customer, and/or resident use oriented toward a public street, public open space, or a privately-owned
“space open to the public”, with first priority assigned to State Street, and second priority assigned to all
other public streets.
b. Lots within the CXD-C zone with frontage on both State Street and Canyon Crossing (800 North) shall have
an entrance on the corner where the two streets meet.
c. Corner entrances at street intersections are encouraged throughout the CXD zones. An example of a
desirable corner entrance is shown in the following image:
7. Windows and Awnings. In the CXD-C zone, at least 70% of each street-facing, ground story façade shall
consist of transparent window coverage that is readily visible to a depth of at least five feet into the building.
All awnings shall be durable canvas or standing seam metal. Plastic awnings are not permitted.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1079
8. Balconies. Balconies consisting of a minimum area of fifty (50) square feet shall be provided for at least fifty
(50) percent of all residential units per building in the CXD-C and CXD-Res-A zones. Balconies may be inset into
the building or may project over City sidewalk a maximum of five feet so long as fourteen (14) feet of vertical
clearance is provided between the sidewalk and the balcony. Balconies that don’t face a public street shall be
set back at least eight feet from any adjacent property line.
9. Drive-thru Structures.
a. Drive-thru canopy structures (such as a Drive-Thru ATM canopy) shall be located only on the rear or a nonstreet
facing façade(s) of a building.
b. Drive-thru windows, aisles, and vehicle stacking for drive-thrus are not permitted on any street-facing
façade and/or within any street-facing setback areas.
10. Screening.
a. Trash storage containers (but not including trash cans associated with individual units in the CXD-RES(B)
zone) and dumpsters shall be completely screened from public view with a masonry wall at least seven
feet in height with sight-obscuring gates which must be located either behind, on a non-street facing side,
or interior to a building.
b. All electrical, utility, and mechanical equipment (including equipment on roofs) shall be fully screened

within any front or side street-facing setback areas, or if located within any required planter strip areas.
11. Lighting.
a. Each site (except for development in the CXD-RES(B) zone) shall include a Lighting Plan that is designed to
discourage crime, enhance safety, and prevent direct glare onto adjacent properties.
12. Open Space.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1080
a. All lots in the CXD-C, CXD-Res(B), and CXD-Res(A) zones with a residential use component shall have a
minimum twenty percent (20%) of the lot area dedicated to open space (excluding required public
sidewalks and planter strips). This requirement may be fulfilled with standard “open space” or with a
“space open to the public” or a combination of both. However, a minimum of 10% of the lot’s area shall be
maintained as a “space open to the public” (see Section 22-2-1 for definitions of “open space” and “spaces
open to the public”).
b. Commercial lots without a residential use component are not required to provide any type of “open
space” (apart from the required sidewalks, planter strips and other required landscaping). However, if a
“space open to the public” is provided on a commercial lot without a residential use, the following

G. Transportation.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1081
1. Streets. Private streets are not permitted in the CXD zones. However private pedestrian promenades,
driveways, vehicular accesses, and alleyways are permitted provided proper fire access is maintained
throughout the site.
2. Driveways and Accesses.
a. Vehicular accesses shall be no more than thirty feet wide unless the Planning Commission finds, based
on a traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City
Transportation Engineer, that a wider access is necessary for the site. In no event shall an access
exceed forty (40) feet in width.
b. No more than one access shall be allowed per lot unless the Planning Commission finds, based on a
traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City
Transportation Engineer, that more than one access is needed for development on the lot.
c. Where a driveway crosses a public sidewalk, the driveway shall be a different stained color, texture, or
paving material than the sidewalk to warn drivers of the possibility of pedestrians in the area. (See
Figure 9 below). This requirement shall not apply in the CXD-Res-B zone.
d. All adjoining properties are required to share vehicular and pedestrian accesses to public streets and
sidewalks and to provide any necessary cross-access easements to effectuate this sharing. This
requirement shall not apply in the CXD-Res-B zone.
Fig. 9 Stamped and colored asphalt.
A. Traffic Study.
1. A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) shall be required in connection with any site plan in the CXD zones that is not a
minor amendment as defined in Section 22-14-20(C)(3)(b). The provisions of Section 22-14-20(E)(8)(a-c)
shall apply to any required TIS. The TIS shall evaluate the vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic both on
site and in the general vicinity of the project. The TIS shall evaluate trip generations, turning movements
to and from the property, street and roundabout geometrics, and traffic safety on and off the site. The TIS
shall also address relevant items including but not limited to the following: surrounding street and
intersection levels of service (LOS) before and after the project is completed, any mitigation efforts
recommended to minimize project traffic impacts, proposed public and private street widths and
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1082
alignments, site mobility, access management, potential traffic signal locations, street striping, signage,
etc. The traffic engineer that performs the required TIS shall meet with the City Traffic Engineer prior to
beginning the TIS to discuss specific areas of focus for the TIS. Each site plan shall reflect and incorporate
the recommendations of the traffic study and any other requirements that the City may deem necessary
based upon the TIS. Any new development or redevelopment shall comply with all recommendations of
the TIS.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
H. Parking.
1. Parking Requirements.
a. Required parking in the CXD zones may be met within a parking lot, parking structure, or a shared parking
agreement approved by the City.
b. For the CXD-C zone, three parking stalls shall be provided for every one-thousand (1000) square feet of
gross leasable floor area of nonresidential uses. Since any residential use in these zones is required to be
part of a mixed-use development, no parking stalls shall be required for residential units included within
the base residential density. The base residential density is calculated by dividing the total commercial
parking requirement by three (3). For each residential unit in excess of the base residential density, a
minimum of 1.75 parking stalls shall be provided (of which .1 stalls per unit shall be dedicated to visitor
parking).
c. For the CXD-Res (A&B) zones, 2.5 stalls shall be provided for each standard residential unit (less than three
bedrooms and less than 1200 square feet) and 3.5 stalls shall be provided for each large residential unit
(three or more bedrooms or 1200 or more square feet). Where parking areas are shared between multiple
units, parking stalls shall be dedicated to each unit or to visitor parking by signage or painted numbering
and at least 0.5 stalls of the per unit required parking standard shall be reserved for visitor parking.
d. No Charge for Use of Required Parking. In order to ensure that residents of a development do not have an
incentive to park off-site, no fee charge, deposit or other form of compensation (other than rent) may be
required of a tenant for the right to use required parking stalls (including, for purposes of this subsection,
the right to exclusive use of a particular parking stall). Neither the rent, the deposit or other fees charged
to tenants may differ based on whether the tenant is given the right to use required parking. No form of
compensation (including but not limited to a reduction in rent or other fees or charges) may be given to a
tenant in exchange for a waiver or relinquishment of the right to use required parking. No penalty of any
kind may be imposed upon a tenant for parking in a required parking stall.
(Ord. No. 2019-0032, Enacted 10/8/2019)
e. Site plans within the CXD District are not eligible for any parking modifications outlined in Section 22-15-5
and must meet the parking requirements outlined in this section.
(Ord. No. 2019-0032, Enacted 10/8/2019)
1. Parking Lot Standards. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of Article 22-15 (Off-Street
Parking) shall apply to all development in the CXD zones.
a. Buildings shall be sited to face the street with parking lots on the side or rear. Adjoining properties that
have neighboring parking lots shall be connected and have cross-access easements established upon final
plat approval. Any parking lots on the side of a building shall be set back at least 20 feet from a sidewalk
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1083
adjacent to a street. The 20-foot parking setback area shall be maintained as “open space” or a “space
open to the public” and shall be maintained with shrubs or other sight-obscuring features at a minimum
height of three feet to screen the parking area from the street.
b. Parking Lot Lighting: Parking lot light poles on properties adjacent to residential zones (including the CXDRES(
B) zone but not the CXD-RES(A) zone) shall be no closer than 50 feet to the adjacent residential
property line. Additionally, globes must be shielded and the lighting directed down to minimize light
encroachment onto adjacent properties or into upper level residential units in multi-story buildings.
Lightproof fencing is also required when adjacent to residentially properties that are not in a CXD zone.
c. Concrete curbs shall be provided between landscaped areas and off-street parking areas. Low-profile
curbs are permitted to accommodate low-impact developments (LIDs) in all landscaped areas except for
within required planter strips along State Street (see also landscaping requirements in Section 22-14-13
(C)).
2. Parking Structures.
a. The street-facing façade of a parking structure must be “wrapped” with a habitable building designed and
constructed for residential or commercial uses. All other facades of a parking structure shall be wrapped
with buildings and/or have an external skin (or screen) designed to improve its visual appeal. Examples
include heavy gauge metal screening, precast concrete panels, laminated or safety glass, decorative solar
panels, or decorative façades. The intent is for parking structures to blend into surrounding buildings and
not look like a parking structure. The Planning Commission may approve other decorative materials not
listed herein if the proposed materials would have an equal or better aesthetic effect than the approved
materials listed herein. All readily visible areas not wrapped with buildings shall be screened. To the
greatest extent possible, uneven levels in parking structures shall be screened from public view. The
following images demonstrate parking structure wrapping:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1084
b. Elevators and stairs shall be highlighted architecturally so visitors, internally and externally, can easily
access these entry points.
c. Any signage attached to the parking structure and wayfinding signage shall be integrated with the
architecture of the parking structure and be architecturally compatible with the design. Public parking
structures entrances shall be clearly signed from public streets.
d. At a minimum, all street-facing façades of all parking structures shall be wrapped with structures designed
and constructed for a commercial or residential use.
e. Parking structures shall be designed to minimize vehicle noise and odors that emanate on to sidewalks
and “spaces open to the public”. Venting and fan locations shall not be located next to “spaces open to
the public” and are encouraged to be located on top of the parking structure where feasible.
4. Specific use parking exceptions as established in Section 22-15-4 (G) apply in the CXD Zone.
5. Parking modifications as established in Section 22-15-5 apply in the CXD Zone.
6. Bicycle parking requirements as established in Section 22-15-7 apply in the CXD Zone.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
I. Signs.
1. Except as otherwise provided herein, all signs in the Canyon Crossing District zones shall meet the standards
provided in Article 14-3. All areas within the CXD-C and CXD-Res-A zones shall be designated as Sign Zone “H”
(14-3-3).
2. Removal of Pole Signs. One of the purposes of the CXD zones is to provide a more attractive environment for
commercial and residential uses. The City has determined that pole signs are less aesthetically appealing than
other types of signs such as monument signs. Therefore, pole signs are not permitted in the Canyon Crossing
District zones. Any existing pole signs shall be removed in the event that reconstruction is performed on
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the footprint of an existing building on the lot upon which the pole sign(s) is
located, upon the addition or expansion of a building that constitutes fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
existing building footprint on the lot, or upon the construction of a new building on a lot. The removal of
existing pole signs required by this section shall occur before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the
new building or building expansion.

22-24-4. The Arts District (AD) Zone.
A. Purpose.
The Arts District (AD) zones are intended to provide a focal point for the arts in the City and to thereby promote
the cultural heritage and artistic development of the City. The AD zones are also intended to be centered around
cultural, educational, and entertainment activities in Orem, with more emphasis on residential and mixed-use
developments with great access to amenities.
(Ord No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
B. Boundaries of Arts District Zones.
There is hereby established three Arts District zones which consist of the following zones: (1) AD-C (Core), (2) ADCiv
(Civic), (3) AD-Res (Residential). Where used in this Section 22-24-4, the term “AD zones” refers to all three of
the above-referenced zones. Although the AD zones have many of the same standards in common, each AD zone
is a fully independent and separate zone. The boundaries of each of the three Arts District zones are as shown in
the map below:

C. Use of Certain Terms. As used in this Section 22-24-4, the terms listed below shall have the following
meanings:
1. “Required Sidewalk” or “Sidewalk Adjacent to a Street” means the buffered sidewalk required by Orem
City Code Section 22-8-8(B)(4) or sidewalks required by other applicable sections of the Orem City Code.
2. A “street-facing façade” is any building elevation that faces a public street and is located within one
hundred feet of a required sidewalk. For purposes of this definition, a building elevation faces a public
street if any part of the elevation is visible from the street at a point on a line between the building and
the street that is perpendicular to the street.

E. Uses.
1. Permitted Uses. All uses permitted in the C2 zone as well as SLU Code 1112 (Condominiums) and 1120
(Apartments) are permitted in the AD-C, AD-Civ zones (subject to the limitation on residential uses
outlined below). All uses permitted in the PRD zone as well as SLU Code 1112 (Condominiums) and 1120
(Apartments) are permitted in the AD-Res zone, however stacked units are not permitted in the AD-Res
zone.
2. Prohibited Uses. Any use that is not included as a permitted use in subsection (1) above is prohibited in all
of the AD zones.
3. Limitation on Residential Use. In order to encourage the development of commercial uses in the AD-C
zone, residential uses in any building in the AD-C zone shall not occupy more than 90% of the Gross
Leasable Floor Area (GLFA) of such building.
a. In the AD-C and AD-CIV zones, if at least 50% of a parcel’s street frontage is occupied by buildings that
meet the maximum setback requirement of subsection (F)(2) below and have pedestrian access to the
street at ground level, a building on the interior of the parcel may exceed the maximum residential
GLFA limit by an amount equal to the amount (in square feet) by which the residential GLFA of
buildings meeting the maximum setback requirement on the same parcel is below the maximum
residential GLFA allowed in such buildings. This transfer of allowable residential occupancy may only
be made to interior buildings and buildings with street frontage may in no case exceed the maximum
residential GLFA requirement. Any such transfer shall be recorded upon a plat and recorded at the
office of the Utah County Recorder. Upon, the execution of such a transfer of allowable residential
occupancy, residential uses in the building that transferred a portion of its allowable residential use
percentage shall not exceed the maximum percentage of GLFA allowed by the applicable zone less the
amount of residential GLFA that was transferred to another building. For example, if a parcel in the
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1088
AD-C zone has two buildings that each contain 50,000 square feet of GLFA and at least 50% of the
street frontage of said parcel is occupied by a building that meets the maximum setback requirements,
the interior building could be 100% occupied by residential uses provided that no more than 30,000
square feet of GLFA of the building fronting the street was occupied by residential uses and the
transfer of 10,000 square feet of residential occupancy from the building with street frontage to the
building on the interior of the lot was shown on a plat recorded with the Utah County Recorder.
Following the transfer, residential uses in the building with street frontage could not exceed 30,000
square feet of GLFA ((80% x 50,000)-10,000 (transferred) = 30,000).
b. A transfer of residential occupancy as described above is permanent unless modified by the owners of
both buildings by an amended plat. If a parcel on which a transfer described above has taken place is
subdivided, all buildings on the new parcels shall continue to meet the requirements with respect to
maximum percentage of GFLA that may be occupied by residential uses to which they were subject
prior to the subdivision.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
F. Design Standards.
1. Building Height. All buildings in the AD zones except for buildings in the AD-RES zone shall be at least two
stories in height. Buildings in the AD-RES zone shall have a maximum height of 35 feet. There is no
maximum height requirement for the AD-C and AD-CIV zones. Each building story above the ground story
shall be designed and constructed to have at least 60% of the Gross Leasable Floor Area of the story
directly below. The ground story of every building, except for buildings in the AD-Res zone, shall have a
floor to ceiling height of at least 14 feet.
* A ground floor story in the AD-CIV zone that has an average floor to ceiling height of 18 feet or more shall count
as two (2) stories toward the minimum story requirement.
2. Setbacks. Except as otherwise provided below, there are no minimum setbacks in the AD zones.
a. Maximum Setbacks. Except as otherwise provided herein, the ground level story of all buildings shall
be set back no more than ten feet from the back of a required sidewalk. However, buildings may be set
back an additional ten feet (for a total of twenty feet) from the back of a required sidewalk if the entire
additional setback area is utilized as a “space open to the public” such as a plaza or outdoor dining
area that is designed to be utilized by the public on a regular basis. A “space open to the public” as
described herein must meet the definition provided in Section 22-2-1. An illustration of the maximum
setback as well as the additional ten foot setback for a space open to the public is provided below.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1089
b. Prohibited Uses of Setback Area. The area of any setback from a required sidewalk may not be used for
parking, parking lot driveways, drive-thrus, or drive-thru stacking.
c. Setback From Residentially Zoned Property. No portion of any building (including roofs and parapets) in
the AD zones may be located closer to a residentially zoned property not a part of the AD zones than the
height of that portion of the building. Note: The width of adjacent public right-of-way may be included
when measuring setbacks to calculate maximum permitted building heights.
Illustration of stepping-back of building height when next to residential zones
d. Exception to Maximum Setback Requirement. Except as otherwise provided herein, no building may be
constructed on a lot that has frontage on a public street unless the building complies with the maximum
setback requirements set forth above.
i. Notwithstanding the above, a building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may
be constructed on a parcel if at least 50% of that parcel’s street frontage is occupied by a building(s)
façade that is located within twenty feet (20’) of the back of required sidewalk.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1090
ii. A lot where less than fifty percent (50%) of the street frontage is occupied by a building(s) facade
located within twenty feet (20’) of the back of required sidewalk may not be subdivided in such way
that creates a new lot (1) that has no street frontage, or (2) where the percentage of the street
frontage of the original lot included in the new lot is less than the percentage of the area of the
original lot included in the new lot. For example, if a lot has 200 feet of street frontage and 40,000
square feet of area, a lot that is subdivided off the original lot that has 50 feet of street frontage (25%
of the total frontage of the original parcel) may not have a total lot area greater than 10,000 square
feet (25% x 40,000). The intent of this requirement is to prevent circumvention of the maximum
setback requirement. This example is demonstrated in the following graphics:
iii. The width of one required street access (up to a maximum of thirty feet (30’) may be subtracted from
the total parcel width when calculating the 50% frontage occupancy requirement.
iv. A building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may be constructed before the 50%
frontage occupancy requirement is met provided that buildings that will bring the lot into compliance
with the 50% frontage occupancy requirement are constructed concurrently with the building that does
not meet the maximum setback requirement.
v. The maximum setback requirements do not apply to detached, single-family dwellings.
3. Lot Size. All lots within the AD zones shall be a minimum of 7,500 square feet in area.
4. Architectural Features. All buildings in the AD-C, AD-Civ, and AD-Res zones shall comply with the
following architectural requirements.
a. Vertical Façade Articulation. The architecture of all street-facing facades shall have a vertical break at
least every fifty feet with a minimum depth of one foot. The required vertical breaks shall extend over
at least 75% of the height of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1091
b. Horizontal Expression Lines. Except for structures in the AD-RES zone, all street-facing facades shall
incorporate horizontal expression lines in their architecture to delineate the ground story from any upper
stories. Such expression lines shall include a cornice and/or a protrusion in materials with a minimum depth
of six inches. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1092
c. Stepbacks. The façade of the second story and all stories above shall be stepped back at least 20 feet
behind the façade of the first story if all of the following apply:
i. The building is four stories or more in height.
ii. The building is designed for residential uses above the first story.
iii. The building is within 35 feet of a sidewalk adjacent to a street. Where the second story is set back at
least twenty feet behind the façade of the first story as required by this subsection, at least seventyfive
percent of the open roof area of the first story shall be designed for and employed as an amenity
for the residential occupants of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
5. Materials.
a. Except as otherwise provided, all buildings shall be completed on all sides with brick, split-face block, glass,
stone, and wood (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 1 Materials”). Aluminum composite material panel
systems, stucco, and Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS) (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 2
Materials”) shall only be permitted as trim on ground-level façades and shall only be allowed on up to a
maximum of 20% of a street-facing façade and up to a maximum of 75% of a non-street facing façade.
b. Standing seam metal (but no other metals) may be used for awnings. Sheet metal and corrugated metal
and other metal finishes are only permitted for soffits, fascia, and similar minor architectural features (less
than or equal to 5% coverage on any given elevation).
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1093
6. Entrances.
a. All primary buildings in the AD-C and AD-Civ zones shall have at least one entrance intended for public,
daily customer, and/or resident use oriented toward a public street, public open space, or a privatelyowned
“space open to the public”, with first priority assigned to State Street, and second priority assigned
to all other public streets.
b. Lots within the AD-C zone with frontage on both State Street and 800 South shall have an entrance on the
corner where the two streets meet.
c. Corner entrances at street intersections are encouraged throughout the AD zones. An example of a
desirable corner entrance is shown in the following image:
7. Windows and Awnings. In the AD-C zone, at least 70% of each street-facing, ground story façade shall consist
of transparent window coverage that is readily visible to a depth of at least five feet into the building. All
awnings shall be durable canvas or standing seam metal. Plastic awnings are not permitted.

public art pieces are worth 3 credits. Large public art pieces are worth 5 credits.
d. Exemption From Public Art Requirement for One-Time Small Expansion or Reconstruction.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, the requirement to install Public Art shall not
apply to a one-time expansion and/or reconstruction of one primary building on a parcel provided that the
expansion and/or reconstruction does not exceed 15% of the GLFA of that building existing as of October
9, 2018. This one time “small building addition or reconstruction” must be constructed at the same time
and may not be divided into multiple additions or reconstructions that combined add up to 15% or less.
e. Public Art Requirements. All Public Art installed on property in the AD-C and AD-Civ zones pursuant to this
Section 22-24-4 shall meet the following additional requirements. The intent of these requirements is to
ensure that the Public Art required on property in the applicable Arts District zones is of high quality and
durability and will promote the objectives stated in the purpose section above. The following
requirements are intended to require that private developers invest time, effort and money into the Public
Art displayed on their sites, recognizing that the art will not only become integral, lasting components of
the Arts District zones, but will be of intrinsic value to their developments.
i. The Public Art shall be created by an artist as defined above.
ii. The Public Art shall be constructed of high-quality, durable and weather-resistant materials. The Public
Art shall be designed to maintain its structural and artistic quality for a period of at least ten years
notwithstanding the effects of the local climate and weather conditions. The Public Art shall be
maintained in a neat and attractive manner and shall be kept free of dirt, rust and graffiti. In the event
that the Public Art deteriorates to a point where it loses its artistic and/or aesthetic appeal and cannot
be restored or repaired by the owner/developer, the owner/developer shall replace the Public Art with
an equivalent piece of Public Art in accordance with the requirements of this Section 22-24-4.
iii. The Public Art shall reflect a high level of artistic and aesthetic quality as reflected by the artistic skill
and aesthetic principles employed in its creation.
iv. The Public Art shall be designed to be compatible with the immediate environment of the site,
particularly in regard to size, scale, materials used, location on the site, etc. The intent of this
requirement is that the Public Art should enhance the aesthetic quality of the property rather than
detract from it.
v. The Public Art shall be situated on the property in such a way that it is readily visible to the public from
a required sidewalk or “space open to the public” as well as to patrons/employees of the uses on the
property.
vi. The materials, textures, colors and design employed in the Public Art shall be appropriate to the
expression of the design concept.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1097
vii. Neither the Public Art nor any part thereof shall contain or consist of commercial speech. Commercial
speech means speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction or expression related
solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.
viii. The Public Art must not create a hazard to the health, safety, or welfare of the public or otherwise
create a nuisance.
ix. In order to ensure that the Public Art required by this section is of high quality and proportional to the
scope and scale of the development, the owner/developer shall either:
(a) Submit a proposal to and receive approval from the Arts District Review Board regarding the Public
Art to be installed on the property. The proposal shall provide a general description of the art that is
proposed to be installed on the property, a preliminary design of the proposed art (where practicable),
the name and credentials of the artist(s) who will be creating the art, the proposed location of the art
on the property, a description of the dimensions, location, materials, colors to be employed in the
creation of the art, and an estimate of the cost of creating the art. The Arts District Review Board shall
review the proposal and shall approve it only if it meets all of the requirements of this Section 22-14-4
as well as the purpose set forth in Section 22-14-4(A); or
(b) Invest an amount of money in the design, creation and installation of the Public Art on the subject
property that is equal to or greater than one percent of the projected construction costs (as reflected
in the building permit documents) of the proposed development activity on the property and provide
documentation to the City verifying the amount spent on such Public Art; or
(c) If the owner/developer of property in the AD-C or AD-Civ zones does not wish to install Public Art
on its property, the owner/developer may, in lieu of such requirement, donate to the City Arts District
fund an amount equal to 1% of the projected construction costs of the proposed development on the
property. Any funds contributed to the City Arts District fund in accordance with this subsection shall
be used exclusively for the creation and installation of Public Art on City-owned property in the Arts
District zones.
An owner/developer is not required to obtain approval from the Arts District Review Board prior to installing the
required Public Art. However, an owner/developer must still comply with either subsection (a), (b) or (c) above
and if the owner/developer elects to install the Public Art before receiving approval from the Arts District Review
Board, the owner/developer assumes the risk that additional expense might be incurred in obtaining the Board’s
approval or complying with subsection (b) or (c) if the Public Art installed does not comply with the requirements
of this section.
f. Required Public Art (including murals) shall not exceed a height of thirty (30) feet above ground level.
g. The Public Art required by this section shall be fully completed and installed on the applicable property
prior to the issuance of any temporary or final certificate of occupancy for the development activity on
which the Public Art requirement was based.
h. The owner/developer of property shall post a bond for any required Public Art prior to the issuance of a
building permit for the applicable development activity. The bond for the required Public Art shall be in an
amount equal to one percent of the projected construction costs of the development activity unless the
owner/developer has received approval of the proposed Public Art from the Arts District Review Board in
which case the amount of the bond shall be the estimated cost of the Public Art approved by the Arts
District Review Board.
i. Any new site plan or amended site plan in the AD-C or AD-Civ zones shall show the location of any
required Public Art as well as a note describing the required Public Art. The site plan shall also contain a
note indicating that the required Public Art must be fully completed and installed prior to the issuance of a
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1098
temporary or final certificate of occupancy for the development activity on which the Public Art
requirement was based.

a. Vehicular accesses shall be no more than thirty feet wide unless the Planning Commission finds, based
on a traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City
Transportation Engineer, that a wider access is necessary for the site. In no event shall an access
exceed forty (40) feet in width.
b. No more than one access shall be allowed per lot unless the Planning Commission find, based on a
traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City
Transportation Engineer, that more than one access is needed for development on the lot.
c. Where a driveway crosses a public sidewalk, the driveway shall be a different stained color, texture, or
paving material than the sidewalk to warn drivers of the possibility of pedestrians in the area (See
Figure 9 below).This requirement shall not apply in the AD-RES zone.
d. All adjoining properties are required to share vehicular and pedestrian accesses to public streets and
sidewalks and to provide any necessary cross-access easements to effectuate this sharing. This
requirement shall not apply in the AD-RES zone.

3. Traffic Study.
a. A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) shall be required in connection with any site plan in the AD zone that is not
a minor amendment as defined in Section 22-14-20(C)(3)(b). The provisions of Section 22-14-
20(E)(8)(a-c) shall apply to any required TIS. The TIS shall evaluate the vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian
traffic both on site and in the general vicinity of the project. The TIS shall evaluate trip generations,
turning movements to and from the property, street and roundabout geometrics, and traffic safety on
and off the site. The TIS shall also address relevant items including but not limited to the following:
surrounding street and intersection levels of service (LOS) before and after the project is completed,
any mitigation efforts recommended to minimize project traffic impacts, proposed public and private
street widths and alignments, site mobility, access management, potential traffic signal locations,
street striping, signage, etc. The traffic engineer that performs the required TIS shall meet with the City
Traffic Engineer prior to beginning the TIS to discuss specific areas of focus for the TIS. The Each site
plan shall reflect and incorporate the recommendations of the traffic study and any other
requirements that the City may deem necessary based upon the TIS. Any new development or
redevelopment shall comply with all recommendations of the TIS.

H. Parking.
1. Parking Requirements.
a. Required parking in the AD zones may be met within a parking lot, parking structure, or a shared
parking agreement approved by the City.
b. For the AD-C and AD-Civ zones, three parking stalls shall be provided for every one-thousand (1000)
square feet of gross leasable floor area of nonresidential uses. Since any residential use in these zones
is required to be part of a mixed-use development, no parking stalls shall be required for residential
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1107
units included within the base residential density. The base residential density is calculated by dividing
the total commercial parking requirement by three (3). For each residential unit in excess of the base
residential density, a minimum of 1.75 parking stalls shall be provided (of which .1 stalls per unit shall
be dedicated to visitor parking).
c. For the AD-Res zone, 2.5 stalls shall be provided for each standard residential unit (less than three
bedrooms and less than 1200 square feet) and 3.5 stalls shall be provided for each large residential
unit (three or more bedrooms or 1200 or more square feet). Where parking areas are shared between
multiple units, parking stalls shall be dedicated to each unit or to visitor parking by signage or painted
numbering and at least 0.5 stalls of the per unit required parking standard shall be reserved for visitor
parking.
d. No Charge for Use of Required Parking. In order to ensure that residents of a development do not
have an incentive to park off-site, no fee charge, deposit or other form of compensation (other than
rent) may be required of a tenant for the right to use required parking stalls (including, for purposes of
this subsection, the right to exclusive use of a particular parking stall). Neither the rent, the deposit or
other fees charged to tenants may differ based on whether the tenant is given the right to use
required parking. No form of compensation (including but not limited to a reduction in rent or other
fees or charges) may be given to a tenant in exchange for a waiver or relinquishment of the right to
use required parking. No penalty of any kind may be imposed upon a tenant for parking in a required
parking stall.
(Ord. No. 2019-0032, Enacted 10/8/2019)
e. Site plans within the AD District are not eligible for any parking modifications outlined in Section 22-
15-5 and must meet the parking requirements outlined in this section.(Ord. No. 2019-0032, Enacted
10/8/2019)
2. Parking Lot Standards. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of Article 22-15 (Off-Street
Parking) shall apply to all development in the AD zones.
a. Buildings shall be sited to face the street with parking lots on the side or rear. Adjoining properties that
have neighboring parking lots shall be connected and have cross-access easements established upon
final plat approval. Any parking lots on the side of a building shall be set back at least 20 feet from a
sidewalk adjacent to a street. The 20 foot parking setback area shall be maintained as “open space” or
a “space open to the public” and shall be maintained with shrubs or other sight-obscuring features at a
minimum height of three feet to screen the parking area from the street.
b. Parking Lot Lighting: Parking lot light poles on properties adjacent to residential zones (including the
AD-RES zone) outside of the AD zones shall be no closer than 50 feet to the adjacent residential
property line. Additionally, globes must be shielded and the lighting directed down to minimize light
encroachment onto adjacent properties or into upper level residential units in multi-story buildings.
Lightproof fencing is also required when adjacent to residentially properties that are not in an AD
zone.
c. Concrete curbs shall be provided between landscaped areas and off-street parking areas. Low-profile
curbs are permitted to accommodate low-impact developments (LIDs) in all landscaped areas except
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1108
for within required planter strips along State Street (see also landscaping requirements in Section 22-
14-13 (C)).
3. Parking Structures.
a. The street-facing façade of a parking structure must be “wrapped” with a habitable building designed
and constructed for residential or commercial uses. All other facades of a parking structure shall be
wrapped with buildings and/or have an external skin (or screen) designed to improve its visual appeal.
Examples include heavy gauge metal screening, precast concrete panels, laminated or safety glass,
decorative solar panels, or decorative façades. The intent is for parking structures to blend into
surrounding buildings and not look like a parking structure. The Planning Commission may approve
other decorative materials not listed herein if the proposed materials would have an equal or better
aesthetic effect than the approved materials listed herein. All readily visible areas not wrapped with
buildings shall be screened. To the greatest extent possible, uneven levels in parking structures shall
be screened from public view. The following images demonstrate parking structure wrapping:
b. Elevators and stairs shall be highlighted architecturally so visitors, internally and externally, can easily
access these entry points.
c. Any signage attached to the parking structure and wayfinding shall be integrated with the architecture
of the parking structure and be architecturally compatible with the design. Public parking structures
entrances shall be clearly signed from public streets.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1109
d. At a minimum, all street-facing facades of all parking structures shall be wrapped with structures
designed and constructed for a commercial or residential use.
e. Parking structures shall be designed to minimize vehicle noise and odors that emanate on to sidewalks
and “spaces open to the public”. Venting and fan locations shall not be located next to “spaces open to
the public” and are encouraged to be located on top of the parking structure where feasible.
4. Specific use parking exceptions as established in Section 22-15-4 (G) apply in the AD Zone.
5. Parking modifications as established in Section 22-15-5 apply in the AD Zone.
6. Bicycle parking requirements as established in Section 22-15-7 apply in the AD Zone.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
I. Signs.
1. Except as otherwise provided herein, all signs in the Arts District zones shall meet the standards provided
in Article 14-3. All areas within the AD-C, AD-Civ and AD-Res zones shall be designated as Sign Zone “H”
(14-3-3).
2. Removal of Pole Signs. One of the purposes of the AD zones is to provide a more attractive environment
for commercial and residential uses. The City has determined that pole signs are less aesthetically
appealing than other types of signs such as monument signs. Therefore, pole signs are not permitted in
the Arts District zones. Any existing pole signs shall be removed in the event that reconstruction is
performed on fifteen percent (15%) or more of the footprint of an existing building on the lot upon which
the pole sign(s) is located, upon the addition or expansion of a building that constitutes fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the existing building footprint on the lot, or upon the construction of a new building on a
lot. The removal of existing pole signs required by this section shall occur before the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for the new building or building expansion.

Effective on: 10/9/2018
22-24-5. North Village District (NVD) Zone.
A. Purpose.
The North Village District (NVD) zones are located at the City’s northern gateway. The NVD zones are intended to
be more residential in nature, with neighborhood retail and smaller-scale development compared to the other
four State Street Districts.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
B. Boundaries of North Village District Zones.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1110
There is hereby established four North Village District zones which consist of the following zones: (1) NVD-C
(Core), (2) NVD-E (Edge), (3) NVD-Res-A (Residential) and (4) NVD-Res-B (Residential). Where used in this Section
22-24-5, the term “NVD zones” refers to all four of the above-referenced zones. Although the NVD zones have
many of the same standards in common, each NVD zone is a fully independent and separate zone. The boundaries
of each of the four North Village zones are as shown in the map below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1111
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1112
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
C. Use of Certain Terms.
As used in this Section 22-24-5, the terms listed below shall have the following meanings:
1. “Required Sidewalk” or “Sidewalk Adjacent to a Street” means the buffered sidewalk required by Orem
City Code Section 22-8-8(B)(4) or sidewalks required by other applicable sections of the Orem City Code.
2. A “street-facing façade” is any building elevation that faces a public street and is located within one
hundred feet of a required sidewalk. For purposes of this definition, a building elevation faces a public
street if any part of the elevation is visible from the street at a point on a line between the building and
the street that is perpendicular to the street.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
D. Default Standards. With respect to the NVD-C and NVD-E zones, the standards of the C2 zone (including the
“Zone Development Standards for the State Street Corridor Area” where applicable) shall apply to any
regulation not specifically addressed in this Section 22-24-5. With respect to the NVD-Res (A & B) zones, the
standards of the PRD zone shall apply to any regulation not specifically addressed in this Section 22-24-5.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
E. Uses.
1. Permitted Uses. All uses permitted in the C2 zone as well as SLU Code 1112 (Condominiums) and 1120
(Apartments) are permitted in the NVD-C and NVD-E zones (subject to the limitation on residential uses
outlined below). All uses permitted in the PRD zone as well as SLU Code 1112 (Condominiums) and 1120
(Apartments) are permitted in the NVD-Res-(A&B) zones. However, no stacked units are allowed in the
NVD-Res-B zone.
2. Prohibited Uses. Any use that is not included as a permitted use in subsection (1) above is prohibited in all
of the NVD zones.
3. Limitation on Residential Use. In order to encourage the development of commercial uses in the NVD-C
and NVD-E zones, residential uses in any building in the NVD-C and NVD-E zone shall not occupy more than
the percentage of Gross Leasable Floor Area (GLFA) of such building shown in the table below:
Zone
Maximum
Percentage of GLFA of Any Building that May be Occupied by
Residential Uses (and uses accessory thereto)
North Village District NVD-C 80%
Zones NVD-E 90%
a. If at least 50% of a parcel’s street frontage is occupied by buildings that meet the maximum setback
requirement of subsection (F)(2) below and have pedestrian access to the street at ground level, a
building on the interior of the parcel may exceed the maximum residential GLFA limit by an amount equal
to the amount (in square feet) by which the residential GLFA of buildings meeting the maximum setback
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1113
requirement on the same parcel is below the maximum residential GLFA allowed in such buildings. This
transfer of allowable residential occupancy may only be made to interior buildings and buildings with
street frontage may in no case exceed the maximum residential GLFA requirement. Any such transfer shall
be recorded upon a plat and recorded at the office of the Utah County Recorder. Upon, the execution of
such a transfer of allowable residential occupancy, residential uses in the building that transferred a
portion of its allowable residential use percentage shall not exceed the maximum percentage of GLFA
allowed by the applicable zone less the amount of residential GLFA that was transferred to another
building. For example, if a parcel in the NVD-C zone has two buildings that each contain 50,000 square
feet of GLFA and at least 50% of the street frontage of said parcel is occupied by a building that meets the
maximum setback requirements, the interior building could be 100% occupied by residential uses
provided that no more than 30,000 square feet of GLFA of the building fronting the street was occupied
by residential uses and the transfer of 10,000 square feet of residential occupancy from the building with
street frontage to the building on the interior of the lot was shown on a plat recorded with the Utah
County Recorder. Following the transfer, residential uses in the building with street frontage could not
exceed 30,000 square feet of GLFA ((80% x 50,000)-10,000 (transferred) = 30,000).
b. A transfer of residential occupancy as described above is permanent unless modified by the owners of
both buildings by an amended plat. If a parcel on which a transfer described above has taken place is
subdivided, all buildings on the new parcels shall continue to meet the requirements with respect to
maximum percentage of GFLA that may be occupied by residential uses to which they were subject prior
to the subdivision.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
F. Design Standards.
1. Building Height. All buildings in the NVD-C zone shall be at least two stories in height. Buildings in the
NVD-Res-B zone shall have a maximum height of 35 feet. There is no maximum height requirement for the
NVD-C and NVD-E zones. The ground story of every building, except for buildings in the NVD-Res (A&B)
zones, shall have a floor to ceiling height of at least 14 feet.
2. Setbacks. Except as otherwise provided below, there are no minimum setbacks in the NVD zones.
a. Maximum Setbacks. Except as otherwise provided herein, the ground level story of all buildings shall
be set back no more than ten feet from the back of a required sidewalk. However, buildings may be set
back an additional ten feet (for a total of twenty feet) from the back of a required sidewalk if the entire
additional setback area is utilized as a “space open to the public” such as a plaza or outdoor dining
area that is designed to be utilized by the public on a regular basis. A “space open to the public” as
described herein must meet the definition provided in Section 22-2-1. An illustration of the maximum
setback as well as the additional ten-foot setback for a space open to the public is provided below.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1114
b. Prohibited Uses of Setback Area. The area of any setback from a required sidewalk may not be used for
parking, parking lot driveways, drive-thrus, or drive-thru stacking.
c. Setback From Residentially Zoned Property. No portion of any building (including roofs and parapets) in
the NVD zones may be located closer to a residentially zoned property not a part of the NVD zones than
the height of that portion of the building. Note: The width of adjacent public right-of-way may be included
when measuring setbacks to calculate maximum permitted building heights.
d. Exception to Maximum Setback Requirement. Except as otherwise provided herein, no building may be
constructed on a lot that has frontage on a public street unless the building complies with the maximum
setback requirements set forth above.
i. Notwithstanding the above, a building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may
be constructed on a parcel if at least 50% of that parcel’s street frontage is occupied by a building(s)
façade that is located within twenty feet (20’) of the back of required sidewalk.
ii. A lot where less than fifty percent (50%) of the street frontage is occupied by a building(s) facade
located within twenty feet (20’) of the back of required sidewalk may not be subdivided in such way
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1115
that creates a new lot (1) that has no street frontage, or (2) where the percentage of the street
frontage of the original lot included in the new lot is less than the percentage of the area of the
original lot included in the new lot. For example, if a lot has 200 feet of street frontage and 40,000
square feet of area, a lot that is subdivided off the original lot that has 50 feet of street frontage (25%
of the total frontage of the original parcel) may not have a total lot area greater than 10,000 square
feet (25% x 40,000). The intent of this requirement is to prevent circumvention of the maximum
setback requirement. This example is demonstrated in the following graphics:
iii. The width of one required street access (up to a maximum of thirty feet (30’) may be subtracted from the
total parcel width when calculating the 50% frontage occupancy requirement.
iv. A building that does not meet the maximum setback requirements may be constructed before the 50%
frontage occupancy requirement is met provided that buildings that will bring the lot into compliance
with the 50% frontage occupancy requirement are constructed concurrently with the building that does
not meet the maximum setback requirement.
v. The maximum setback requirements do not apply to detached, single-family dwellings.
3. Lot Size. All lots within the NVD zones shall be a minimum of 7,500 square feet in area.
4. Architectural Features. All buildings in the NVD-C, NVD-E, and NVD-Res-A zones shall comply with the
following architectural requirements.
a. Vertical Façade Articulation. The architecture of all street-facing facades shall have a vertical break at
least every fifty feet with a minimum depth of one foot. The required vertical breaks shall extend over at
least 75% of the height of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1116
b. Horizontal Expression Lines. Except for structures in the NVD-RES(B) zone, all street-facing facades shall
incorporate horizontal expression lines in their architecture to delineate the ground story from any upper
stories. Such expression lines shall include a cornice and/or a protrusion in materials with a minimum
depth of six inches. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1117
c. Stepbacks. The façade of the second story and all stories above shall be stepped back at least 20 feet
behind the façade of the first story if all of the following apply:
i. The building is four stories or more in height.
ii. The building is designed for residential uses above the first story.
iii. The building is within 35 feet of a sidewalk adjacent to a street. Where the second story is set back at
least twenty feet behind the façade of the first story as required by this subsection, at least seventyfive
percent of the open roof area of the first story shall be designed for and employed as an amenity
for the residential occupants of the building. An illustration of this requirement is provided below:
5. Materials.
a. Except as otherwise provided, all buildings shall be completed on all sides with brick, split-face block, glass,
stone, and wood (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 1 Materials”). Aluminum composite material panel
systems, stucco, and Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS) (hereinafter referred to as “Tier 2
Materials”) shall only be permitted as trim on ground-level façades and shall only be allowed on up to a
maximum of 20% of a street-facing façade and up to a maximum of 75% of a non-street facing façades.
b. Standing seam metal (but no other metals) may be used for awnings. Sheet metal and corrugated metal
and other metal finishes are only permitted for soffits, fascia, and similar minor architectural features (less
than or equal to 5% coverage on any given elevation).
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1118
6. Entrances.
a. All primary buildings in the NVD-C and NVD-E zones shall have at least one entrance intended for public,
daily customer, and/or resident use oriented toward a public street, public open space, or a privatelyowned
“space open to the public”, with first priority assigned to State Street, and second priority assigned
to all other public streets.
b. Lots within the NVD-C zone with frontage on both State Street and 1600 North shall have an entrance on
the corner where the two streets meet.
c. Corner entrances at street intersections are encouraged throughout the NVD zones. An example of a
desirable corner entrance is shown in the following image:
7. Windows and Awnings. In the NVD-C and NVD-E zone, each street-facing, ground story façade shall consist of
transparent window coverage that is readily visible to a depth of at least five feet into the building. These
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1119
percentage requirements vary within the NVD zones as shown in the table below. All awnings shall be durable
canvas or standing seam metal. Plastic awnings are not permitted.
Zone Minimum % of
Transparency
NVD-C 70%

8. Balconies. If a building is two stories or greater in height, balconies consisting of a minimum area of fifty (50)
square feet shall be provided for at least fifty (50) percent of all residential units per building in the NVD-C,
NVD-E, and NVD-Res-A zones. Balconies may be inset into the building or may project over City sidewalk a
maximum of five feet so long as fourteen (14) feet of vertical clearance is provided between the sidewalk and
the balcony. Balconies that don’t face a public street shall be set back at least eight feet from any adjacent
property line.
9. Drive-thru Structures.
a. Drive-thru canopy structures (such as a Drive-Thru ATM canopy) shall be located only on the rear or a nonstreet
facing façade(s) of a building.
Drive-thru windows, aisles, and vehicle stacking for drive-thrus are not permitted on any street-facing façade
and/or within any street-facing setback areas.
10. Screening.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1120
a. Trash storage containers (but not including trash cans associated with individual units in the NVD-RES(B)
zone) and dumpsters shall be completely screened from public view with a masonry wall at least seven

G. Transportation.
1. Streets. Private streets are not permitted in the NVD zones. However private pedestrian promenades,
driveways, vehicular accesses, and alleyways are permitted provided proper fire access is maintained
throughout the site.
2. Driveways and Accesses.
a. Vehicular accesses shall be no more than thirty feet wide unless the Planning Commission finds, based
on a traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City
Transportation Engineer, that a wider access is necessary for the site. In no event shall an access
exceed forty (40) feet in width.
b. No more than one access shall be allowed per lot unless the Planning Commission finds, based on a
traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer and/or an analysis provided by the City
Transportation Engineer, that more than one access is needed for development on the lot.
c. Where a driveway crosses a public sidewalk, the driveway shall be a different stained color, texture, or
paving material than the sidewalk to warn drivers of the possibility of pedestrians in the area. (See
Figure 9 below). This requirement shall not apply in the NVD-Res-B zone.
d. All adjoining properties are required to share vehicular and pedestrian accesses to public streets and
sidewalks and to provide any necessary cross-access easements to effectuate this sharing. This
requirement shall not apply in the NVD-Res-B zone.

3. Traffic Study. A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) shall be required in connection with any site plan in the CXD zones
that is not a minor amendment as defined in Section 22-14-20(C)(3)(b). The provisions of Section 22-14-
20(E)(8)(a-c) shall apply to any required TIS. The TIS shall evaluate the vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic
both on site and in the general vicinity of the project. The TIS shall evaluate trip generations, turning
movements to and from the property, street and roundabout geometrics, and traffic safety on and off the
site. The TIS shall also address relevant items including but not limited to the following: surrounding street and
intersection levels of service (LOS) before and after the project is completed, any mitigation efforts
recommended to minimize project traffic impacts, proposed public and private street widths and alignments,
site mobility, access management, potential traffic signal locations, street striping, signage, etc. The traffic
engineer that performs the required TIS shall meet with the City Traffic Engineer prior to beginning the TIS to
discuss specific areas of focus for the TIS. Each site plan shall reflect and incorporate the recommendations of
the traffic study and any other requirements that the City may deem necessary based upon the TIS. Any new
development or redevelopment shall comply with all recommendations of the TIS.

3. Parking.
1. Parking Requirements
a. Required parking in the NVD zones may be met within a parking lot, parking structure, or a shared
parking agreement approved by the City.
b. For the “Core” and “Edge” zones, three parking stalls shall be provided for every one-thousand (1000)
square feet of gross leasable floor area of nonresidential uses. Since any residential use in these zones
is required to be part of a mixed-use development, no parking stalls shall be required for residential
units included within the base residential density. The base residential density is calculated by dividing
the total commercial parking requirement by three (3). For each residential unit in excess of the base
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1123
residential density, a minimum of 1.75 parking stalls shall be provided (of which .10 stalls per unit shall
be dedicated to visitor parking).
c. For the NVD-Res (A&B) zones, 2.5 stalls shall be provided for each standard residential unit (less than
three bedrooms and less than 1200 square feet) and 3.5 stalls shall be provided for each large
residential unit (three or more bedrooms or 1200 or more square feet). Where parking areas are
shared between multiple units, parking stalls shall be dedicated to each unit or to visitor parking by
signage or painted numbering and at least 0.5 stalls of the per unit required parking standard shall be
reserved for visitor parking.
d. In order to ensure that residents of a development do not have an incentive to park off-site, no fee
charge, deposit or other form of compensation (other than rent) may be required of a tenant for the
right to use required parking stalls (including, for purposes of this subsection, the right to exclusive use
of a particular parking stall). Neither the rent, the deposit or other fees charged to tenants may differ
based on whether the tenant is given the right to use required parking. No form of compensation
(including but not limited to a reduction in rent or other fees or charges) may be given to a tenant in
exchange for a waiver or relinquishment of the right to use required parking. No penalty of any kind
may be imposed upon a tenant for parking in a required parking stall.
(Ord. No. 2019-0032, Enacted 10/8/2019)
e. Site plans within the AD District are not eligible for any parking modifications outlined in Section 22-15-5
and must meet the parking requirements outlined in this section.
(Ord. No. 2019-0032, Enacted 10/8/2019)
2. Parking Lot Standards. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of Article 22-15 (Off-Street
Parking) shall apply to all development in the NVD zones.
a. Buildings shall be sited to face the street with parking lots on the side or rear. Adjoining properties that
have neighboring parking lots shall be connected and have cross-access easements established upon
final plat approval. Any parking lots on the side of a building shall be set back at least 20 feet from a
sidewalk adjacent to a street. The 20-foot parking setback area shall be maintained as “open space” or
a “space open to the public” and shall be maintained with shrubs or other sight-obscuring features at a
minimum height of three feet to screen the parking area from the street.
b. Parking Lot Lighting: Parking lot light poles on properties adjacent to residential zones (including the
NVD-RES(B) zone but not the NVD-RES(A) zone) shall be no closer than 50 feet to the adjacent
residential property line. Additionally, globes must be shielded and the lighting directed down to
minimize light encroachment onto adjacent properties or into upper level residential units in multistory
buildings. Lightproof fencing is also required when adjacent to residentially properties that are
not in a NVD zone.
c. Concrete curbs shall be provided between landscaped areas and off-street parking areas. Low-profile
curbs are permitted to accommodate low-impact developments (LIDs) in all landscaped areas except
for within required planter strips along State Street (see also landscaping requirements in Section 22-
14-13 (C)).
3. Parking Structures.
a. The street-facing façade of a parking structure must be “wrapped” with a habitable building designed
and constructed for residential or commercial uses. All other facades of a parking structure shall be
wrapped with buildings and/or have an external skin (or screen) designed to improve its visual appeal.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1124
Examples include heavy gauge metal screening, precast concrete panels, laminated or safety glass,
decorative solar panels, or decorative façades. The intent is for parking structures to blend into
surrounding buildings and not look like a parking structure. The Planning Commission may approve
other decorative materials not listed herein if the proposed materials would have an equal or better
aesthetic effect than the approved materials listed herein. All readily visible areas not wrapped with
buildings shall be screened. To the greatest extent possible, uneven levels in parking structures shall
be screened from public view. The following images demonstrate parking structure wrapping:
b. Elevators and stairs shall be highlighted architecturally so visitors, internally and externally, can easily
access these entry points.
c. Any signage attached to the parking structure and wayfinding signage shall be integrated with the
architecture of the parking structure and be architecturally compatible with the design. Public parking
structures entrances shall be clearly signed from public streets.
d. At a minimum, all street-facing façades of all parking structures shall be wrapped with structures designed
and constructed for a commercial or residential use.
e. Parking structures shall be designed to minimize vehicle noise and odors that emanate on to sidewalks
and “spaces open to the public”. Venting and fan locations shall not be located next to “spaces open to
the public” and are encouraged to be located on top of the parking structure where feasible.
4. Specific use parking exceptions as established in Section 22-15-4 (G) apply in the NVD Zone.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1125
5. Parking modifications as established in Section 22-15-5 apply in the NVD Zone.
6. Bicycle parking requirements as established in Section 22-15-7 apply in the NVD Zone.
(Ord. No. O-2018-0029, Enacted 10/9/2018)
Effective on: 10/9/2018
I. Signs.
1. Except as otherwise provided herein, all signs in the North Village District zones shall meet the standards
provided in Article 14-3. All areas within the NVD-C, NVD-E, and NVD-Res-A zones shall be designated as
Sign Zone “H” (14-3-3).
2. Removal of Pole Signs. One of the purposes of the NVD zones is to provide a more attractive environment
for commercial and residential uses. The City has determined that pole signs are less aesthetically
appealing than other types of signs such as monument signs. Therefore, pole signs are not permitted in
the North Village District zones. Any existing pole signs shall be removed in the event that reconstruction
is performed on fifteen percent (15%) or more of the footprint of an existing building on the lot upon
which the pole sign(s) is located, upon the addition or expansion of a building that constitutes fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the existing building footprint on the lot, or upon the construction of a new
building on a lot. The removal of existing pole signs required by this section shall occur before the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy for the new building or building expansion.

community.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-02-0033, Amended, 09/24/2002)
I. Storm water runoff carries concentrations of oil, grease, nutrients, chemicals, heavy metals, toxic materials,
and other undesirable materials that may jeopardize the integrity of ground waters and receiving waters,
including the City's culinary water supply.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-02-0033, Amended, 09/24/2002)
J. All developed properties in the City contribute to the need for the storm water system by converting natural
ground cover into impervious surfaces.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-02-0033, Amended, 09/24/2002; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)

O. A Storm Water Utility is the most equitable and efficient method of managing storm water in the City and
ensuring that each property in the City pays its fair share of the amount that the property contributes to,
benefits from, and otherwise uses the storm water system.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-02-0033, Amended, 09/24/2002; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
23-1-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this ordinance is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the City and its inhabitants by
improving the City's storm water system, managing and controlling storm water runoff, protecting property,
preventing polluted waters from entering the City's water supply and other receiving waters, and establishing a
viable and fair method of financing the construction, operation and maintenance of the storm water system.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
23-1-3. Definitions.
The following bolded words and phrases shall be defined as follows:
Developed parcel. Any parcel that has been altered from its natural condition by grading, filling, or the
construction of improvements or other impervious surfaces.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-02-0033, Amended, 09/24/2002)
Equivalent Service Unit ("ESU"). The average amount of impervious surface, expressed in square feet, on
developed single family residential parcels in Orem. One ESU equals 2,700 square feet of impervious surface area.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-02-0033, Amended, 09/24/2002)
Impervious surface. Any hard surface, other than the natural surface, that prevents or retards the absorption of
water into the soil, or that causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at a greater rates of flow
than the natural surface.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-02-0033, Amended, 09/24/2002)
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1128
23-1-4. Storm Water Utility.
A. Creation. The City Council hereby creates and establishes a storm water utility as part of the City's overall
sewer system. The storm water utility shall plan, design, construct, maintain, administer, and operate the
City's storm water system.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
B. Enterprise Fund. The City Council hereby establishes a storm water utility enterprise fund to handle all
income, expenses, and other financial transactions related to the storm water utility. All storm water utility
service charges shall be deposited in the enterprise fund. Money in the storm water utility enterprise fund
shall not be commingled with or transferred to other City funds. However, the storm water utility may pay
other City funds for services and expenses directly attributable to the storm water utility. The enterprise fund
shall be operated according to State law and City policy.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
C. Facilities and Assets. The storm water utility shall operate independently of City operations funded by the
general fund. The storm water utility shall have the same relationship to the City as other City utilities, such as
the water utility and the sanitary sewer (waste water) utility. Upon creation of the utility, all of the City's
storm water facilities and assets (other than streets and other facilities and assets designated by the City
Manager) shall be transferred to the storm water utility in consideration for the storm water utility's
agreement to take primary responsibility for planning, designing, constructing, maintaining, administering and
operating the City's storm water system.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
D. Administration. The storm water utility shall be administered by the City's Public Works Director.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
23-1-5. Storm Water Utility Fee.
A. Imposed. Each developed parcel of real property in the City shall be charged a storm water utility fee.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
B. ESU. The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent service units (ESUs) contained in the parcel. The City
Council finds that the ESU is the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel
contributes to, benefits from, and otherwise uses the storm water utility. Based on a study completed by an
independent engineer, the City Council finds and establishes that one ESU equals 2,700 square feet of
impervious surface area.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
C. Calculation. The City Council finds that each single family residential parcel contributes approximately the
same amount of storm water runoff; therefore, each developed single family residential parcel shall pay a
base rate of one (1) ESU. All nonsingle family residential parcels shall pay a multiple of this base rate,
expressed in ESUs, according to the measured impervious area on the parcel. The City Council may adopt
separate rates for PRDs, condominiums and other uses that are not easily handled under the standard rate
schedule.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1129
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96)
D. Charge per ESU. The amount charged for each ESU shall be established by resolution of the City Council.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96)
E. Exemptions and Credits. The City Council may establish exemptions and credits to the storm water utility fee
by resolution.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
F. Policies. The Public Works Director may adopt policies, consistent with this ordinance and any resolutions
passed by the City Council, to assist in the application, administration, and interpretation of this ordinance and
any resolutions related to the storm water utility.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
G. Appeals. Any person or entity that believes that this ordinance, or any storm water utility rate resolution, was
interpreted or applied erroneously may appeal to the Public Works Director ("Director"). The appeal shall be
in writing, shall state any facts supporting the appeal, and shall be made within ten (10) days of the decision,
action, or bill being appealed. The Director may elect to hold a hearing on the appeal. The Director shall
decide the appeal within ten (10) days of when the appeal is filed. If the person or entity is not satisfied with
the Director's decision, a further appeal may be made to the City Manager (or his or her designee). The appeal
to the City Manager shall follow the same procedure as the appeal to the Director. The City Manager's
decision shall be final and binding on all parties.
(Ord. No. O-96-0006, Enacted, 03/26/96; Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Amended 08/25/2015)
23-1-6. Billing.
The City Council finds that the City's storm water system, sanitary sewer system, culinary water system, and solid
waste collection system are interrelated services that are part of a unified City plan to provide for the health,
safety, and welfare of the City and its residents in an environmentally responsible manner. Therefore, the storm
water utility fee shall be included on the City's regular monthly utility bill for any given property. If there is no
regular utility bill for the property, the storm water utility fee shall be charged to the owner of the property. The
fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the City by the person or entity paying for the City utility services
provided to the property. All properties shall be charged the fee, regardless of whether or not the owner or
occupant of the property requests the storm water utility service. Failure to pay any portion of the utility bill may
result in termination of water service.

Common Plan of Development is a plan to subdivide a parcel of land into separate parts for separate sale. This
can be for a residential, commercial, or industrial development. The plan originates as a single parcel which is
separated into parts. The original plan is considered the "common plan of development or sale" whether phased
or completed in steps. If a further plan is conceived that was not foreseen during the original plan, or the original
plan is added onto but the addition was conceived later and was not included in any part of the original plan
concept and/or development, and it develops after the completion of the construction of the entire original plan,
it would be a separate "common plan of development or sale". More than one owner of developable land can
purposely join together and develop a single common plan of development or sale, but without a determined
effort and coordinated planning, land owned by different owners would not be considered part of a single
common plan of development or sale.

control, and facilitate storm water discharges from the site. All BMP plans shall provide for
pretreatment of storm water unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Development Review Committee (DRC) that pretreatment is not necessary because of (1) lack of
pollutants in the storm water from the site, or (2) insufficient quantity of storm water from the site.
b. Purpose of BMPs. The BMPs shall be designed to ensure that the quality and quantity of storm water
discharged to the City’s storm water system meet the requirements of federal, state, and local laws
and regulations and the City’s UPDES permit, and will not exceed the designed capacity of the storm
water system or jeopardize the integrity of the storm water system.
c. Acceptable BMPs. BMPs may be structural and/or nonstructural, depending on the needs of the site.
The applicant may propose BMPs designed specifically for a given site, or may propose BMPs that have
been preapproved by the City. The City shall establish a menu of preapproved BMPs by administrative
policy. The policy may designate specified areas of the City where certain types of BMPs may or may
not be used.
d. City Approval of BMP Plan. The applicant’s BMP Plan must be approved by the City. The BMP Plan will
be reviewed as part of the Storm Water Connection Permit review process described below.
3. Maintenance Plan. A plan outlining how the applicant will maintain the storm water improvements listed
in the application.

(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
23-4-7(1). Purpose and IntentIntent.
The purpose of Section 23-4-7 is to prevent the discharge of sediment and other construction-related pollutants
from construction sites. Sediment and debris from construction sites are a major source of pollution to waterways
and water systems located within the City and surrounding areas. Each year storm water runoff carries tons of
sediment from construction sites into local drainage systems, irrigation systems, canals, rivers, and lakes.
Sediment from storm water runoff also clogs and obstructs storm drains, culverts, and canals and causes damage
to private property, wildlife habitat and water quality.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
23-4-7(2). Land Disturbance Permit – When Required.
A. Permit Required. A Land Disturbance Permit (or “Permit”) is required before any person or entity may
landscape, excavate, grub and clear, grade, or perform any type of land disturbance activity that will disrupt or
cause a change in the natural landscape upon any parcel of property located in the City.
B. Exemptions. The following activities are exempt from the permit requirements of this Section:
1. Actions by a public utility, the City, or any other governmental entity to remove or alleviate an emergency
condition, including the restoration of utility service or the reopening of a public thoroughfare to traffic;
2. Actions by any other person when the City determines, and documents in writing, that the actions are
necessary to remove or alleviate an emergency condition;
3. Land disturbance activities disturbing less than 500 square feet of land surface area;
4. Residential gardening;
5. Bona fide agricultural and farming operations, provided that the agricultural and farming operations
constitute the principal use of the parcel and provided that such use of the parcel does not conflict with
the City’s zoning ordinance;
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
23-4-7(3). Land Disturbance Permit – Application.
Any person or entity desiring a Land Disturbance Permit must first file an application with the Development
Services Department.
A. Application Form. The application shall be submitted on a form approved by the City. If the applicant
proposes to obtain the Permit in conjunction with another development activity requiring City approval (e.g.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1146
building permit, subdivision plat, site plan, or conditional use permit), the application for the Land Disturbance
Permit will be included as part of the application form for the other development activity. If the applicant
proposes to obtain the Permit independent of any other City approval, the applicant shall apply for the Permit
on a separate form prepared by the City. Application forms will be available at the City’s Public Works and
Development Services Departments.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
B. Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. The applicant shall submit a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
with the application. The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (the Plan) shall contain the following
information:
1. Site Description. A site description (including a map with spot elevations and contour lines) which includes
a description of the nature and location of the land disturbance activity, a description of the intended
sequence of major activities which will disturb soils for major portions of the site (e.g. grubbing,
excavation, grading, utilities, and infrastructure installation, etc.), and estimates of the total area of the
site and the total area of the site that is expected to be disturbed by excavation, grading, or other
activities;
2. Control Description. A description of the proposed control measures that will be implemented during the
land disturbance activity and/or while the site is not stable. The Plan must clearly describe the times
during the construction process that the measures will be implemented for each major activity identified
pursuant to subsection (1). The Plan shall also state the name, address, and phone number of the person
or entity responsible for implementation of each control measure.
3. Control Measures. Control measures meeting the following goals and criteria:
a. Prevent or Minimize Discharge. The proposed control measures shall be designed to prevent or
minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the discharge of sediment, debris and other
construction related pollutants from the construction site by storm water runoff into the storm water
system.
b. Prevent or Minimize Construction Debris. The proposed control measures shall be designed to prevent
or minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, the deposit, discharge, tracking by construction
vehicles, or dropping of mud, sediment, debris or other potential pollutants onto public streets and
rights-of-way.
c. Use of BMPs. The proposed control measures shall include BMPs available at the time that the Plan is
submitted. BMPs may include, but shall not be limited to, temporary silt or sediment fences, sediment
traps, concrete washout, washing of applicators and containers used for paint, concrete, stucco or
other materials, and detention ponds, gravel construction entrances and wash down pads to reduce or
eliminate off-site tracking, straw bale sediment barriers, establishment of temporary grasses and
permanent vegetative cover, use of straw mulch as a temporary ground cover, erosion control

systems, and gabions. BMPS shall also include opportunities for use of low impact design (LID) and
green infrastructure to be incorporated into the site design.
d. Stabilize Site. The proposed control measures shall be designed to preserve existing vegetation, where
possible. Disturbed portions of the site shall be stabilized. Stabilization practices may include
temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, geo-textiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer
strips, protection of trees, preservation of mature vegetation, and other appropriate measures. Use of
impervious surfaces for stabilization should be avoided. Stabilization measures shall be initiated as
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1147
soon as practicable in disturbed portions of the site where land disturbance activities have temporarily
or permanently ceased, but in no case more than 14 days after the land disturbance activity in that
portion of the site has temporarily or permanently ceased, except under the following circumstances:
i. If the initiation of stabilization measures by the 14th day after land disturbance activity temporarily
or permanently ceases is precluded by snow cover or frozen ground conditions, stabilization
measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable; or
ii. If land disturbance activity on a portion of the site is temporarily ceased, and earth disturbing will
resume within 21 days, temporary stabilization measures need not be initiated on that portion of
the site.
e. Minimize Risk of Discharge of Other Materials. The proposed control measures shall be employed to
minimize the risk of discharge of construction-related pollutants (such as paint, thinners, solvents and
other chemicals) from the land disturbance site. Such measures may include implementation of
storage practices to minimize exposure of the material to storm water as well as spill prevention and
response.

(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
23-4-8(7). General Performance and Site Design Criteria for Long-term Storm Water Management.
A. Performance Criteria. The following performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at
all sites governed by this Section:
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1154
1. All site designs shall establish storm water management practices to mirror predevelopment hydrology of
the previously undeveloped site or to improve the hydrology of a redeveloped site to the maximum extent
practicable. The best available technology and information shall be used for analysis and design of a storm
water management system to meet the requirements of this Section.
2. These practices should seek to utilize low impact development (LID) for storm water treatment and to
infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the
maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. The process shall
include evaluations of BMPs considered and rationale as to why or why not they have been selected. All
rooftop drainage is required to drain to landscaped areas unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
3. All storm water runoff generated from new development or redevelopment sites shall not discharge
untreated storm water directly into a wetland or waters of the State of Utah including the storm water
system without treatment to the maximum extent practical. In no case shall the impact on wetlands be
any less than allowed by the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
4. Each plan shall include an assessment of post construction storm water impacts upon downstream and
upstream properties. The assessment of storm water quality and quantity impacts shall be based on the
standards contained within this Section, at a minimum. The assessment of upstream impacts must be
provided, at a minimum, for property or properties located immediately upstream and/or adjacent to the
proposed development or redevelopment. The assessment of downstream impacts shall be made by
evaluating a site’s contribution to storm water runoff to a suitable downstream point.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
B. Minimum Control Requirements.
1. New Development. For a new development site, all storm water management practices will manage
rainfall on-site and be designed to prevent the off-site discharge of the precipitation from all rainfall
events less than or equal to the 80th percentile rainfall event.
2. Redevelopment. For a redevelopment site, all storm water management practices must include sitespecific
and project-specific measures aimed at net gain to onsite retention to impervious surfaces. If a
redevelopment site increases the impervious surface by greater than 10%, the site shall manage rainfall
on-site and prevent the off-site discharge of the net increase in the volume associated with the
precipitation from all rainfall events less than or equal to the 80th percentile rainfall event.
3. Implementation.
a.
The requirements outlined in subsections 1 and 2 above, must be accomplished by the use of a site
design that contains a combination of practices including structural and non-structural controls that
are designed, constructed, and maintained to infiltrate, evapotranspire, and/or harvest and reuse
rainwater.
b. A developer is required to evaluate Low Impact Design (LID) approaches and may employ any LID
approach found in A Guide to Low Impact Development Within Utah found on the Division of Water
Quality website.
c.
After retention of the 80th percentile amount, discharge will be allowed at sixty (60) gallons per
minute per acre.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1155
d. The City shall reduce any requirement for a new development or redevelopment site to manage or
control stormwater runoff rates or stormwater runoff volumes for flood control purposes to account
for the reduction in stormwater associated with approved LIDs.
e. All other retention, pre-treatment, and maximum release rates are otherwise applicable to new
developments and redevelopments located in Drinking Water Source Protection Zones as defined in
Chapter 21 of the Orem City Code.
4. Feasibility and Dispute Resolution.
a. Feasibility. If a developer believes it is infeasible to meet the requirements outlined in subsections 1
through 3, the developer must propose alternative design criteria and that criteria must be approved
by the City as part of the Long Term Storm Water Management Plan approval process as outlined in
Orem City Code § 23-4-8(8).
i. In demonstrating infeasibility, the developer must document and quantify that infiltration,
evapotranspiration, and rainwater harvesting have been used to the maximum extent feasible and
that full employment of these controls is infeasible due to constraints. LID infeasibility may be due
to one or more of the following conditions: high groundwater table, drinking water source
protection zones, adverse soil conditions, grades, accessibility, excessive costs, or others.
ii. New developments or redevelopments that impact City of Orem Drinking Water Source Protection
Zones may request a waiver of infiltration LIDs and/or sumps if it is infeasible to infiltrate or there
is an increased risk of pollution but are still required to select and install other structural and nonstructural
LIDs that evapotranspire, filter, or harvest and reuse rainwater and to otherwise comply
with Chapter 21 and Chapter 23 of the Orem City Code.
b.
If the City and developer are unable to resolve conflicts related to these retention requirements, the
dispute will be resolved pursuant to Utah Code § 19-5-108.5 (effective July 1, 2020).
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015, Ord. No. O-2020-0014; Amended 06/30/2020)

conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be considered:
1. Topography
2. Drainage Area(s)
3. Soils
4. Slopes
5. Terrain
6. Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features
7. Receiving waters
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
D. Conveyance Issues. All storm water management practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow
for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1156
E. Pretreatment Requirements. Every storm water treatment practice shall have an acceptable form of water
quality pretreatment. The proposed pretreatment shall address the anticipated pollutants that would
normally be expected from the proposed development. Approval by City of pretreatment devices is required
before work can begin. The use of LIDs is encouraged and evaluation documentation is required.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
F. Landscaping Requirements. All storm water management practices must have a landscaping plan detailing
both the vegetation to be in practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. Any area of
land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by
development or redevelopment activities and is not part of an actual building construction or a future parking
area shall be revegetated within fourteen (14) days from the substantial completion of such clearing and
construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts:
1. Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw
mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is
established over ninety percent (90%) of the seeded area.
2. Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw
mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are
capable of controlling erosion.
3. Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of seventy percent (70%) of the cover crop
throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive
years until the minimum seventy percent (70%) survival for one (1) year is achieved.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
G. Maintenance Agreements. All storm water practices shall be maintained in accordance with the approved and
deeded storm water maintenance agreement and Long-term Storm Water Management Plan. All storm water
treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance activities to ensure the system
functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and
inspect the storm water treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure
proper functioning of the storm water treatment practice. In addition, the agreement needs to specify the
parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all storm water treatment practices prior to issuance of any
permits for development or redevelopment activities.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
H. Nonstructural Storm Water Practices. The evaluation and use of at least one nonstructural storm water
treatment practices is required on all new and redeveloped sites. The use of additional nonstructural storm
water treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. These
nonstructural practices include practices found in the Storm Water Credit Program Manual as well as in
manuals, pamphlets, booklets, etc. that discusses LIDs for construction sites.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
I. Protection of Point of Discharge. Discharge from any on-site storm water management system into any
natural or surface drainage channel or feature, shall be designed and constructed so that the discharge does
not cause damage to the receiving system.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1157
J. Protection of Receiving Channels and Waters. Receiving channels and water bodies (on-site and/or off-site)
shall be evaluated to ensure that downstream conveyances are not eroded and/or degraded by altered storm
water flows from development or redevelopment. Acceptable mitigation alternatives include on-site
detention to reduce post construction runoff rates and volumes and channel stabilization measures to control
channel degradation.
(Ord. No. O-2015-0027; Enacted 08/25/2015)
K. Design of Water Impounding Structures (Dams). Any proposed water impounding structure (dam) shall be

catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement
of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner and the
inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper
functioning of the storm water management facility. At its discretion and as reflected in the maintenance
agreement, the City may authorize the use of private inspectors to conduct and document post
construction maintenance inspections.

Court, there is a sufficient record to review the Hearing Officer’s Order, the Court’s review is limited to the
record provided by the Hearing Officer. The District Court may not accept or consider any evidence
outside of the Hearing Officer’s record unless the evidence was offered to the Hearing Officer and the

24-1-2. Purpose and Intent.
The purpose of this Article is to assist in the implementation of the City of Orem Water Rights Capital Facilities
Plan and to regulate the use and development of land through impact fees so as to assure that new development
bears an appropriate and proportionate share of the cost of increasing the water supply necessitated and
generated by such development. The intent of this Article is to comply with the "Impact Fees Act" Section 11-36-
101 Utah Code Annotated (1953 as amended), the Utah Constitution, and the United States Constitution.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)
24-1-3. Legislative Findings.
The City Council of the City of Orem, Utah finds, determines and declares that:
A. Water demand in the City of Orem is projected to grow from approximately 26,000 acre feet per year to over
30,000 acre feet by the year 2005 as a result of new growth.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)
B. There is a drought cycle every six to eight years in the City of Orem.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)
C. During drought years the City only receives a certain percentage of its water rights depending upon the level
of drought.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)
D. During drought years the City generally needs 150 percent of normal water rights to maintain non-drought
levels of service.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)
E. The City of Orem must increase its water rights in order to maintain current levels of service if new
development is to be accommodated. This must be done in order to promote and protect the public health,
safety, and welfare.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)

development of impact fees.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)
G. The imposition of water rights impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that development
bears a proportionate share of the cost of water rights necessary to accommodate such development. This
must be done in order to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)
H. Each of the types of land development described in the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance of the City will
generate increased demand and use of water necessitating the acquisition of water rights to meet the
demand.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)
I. The fees established by this ordinance are derived from, are based upon, and do not exceed, the costs of
providing water necessitated by the new land developments for which the fees are levied.
(Ord. No. O-96-0013, Enacted, 08/06/96; Ord. No. O-97-0030, Amended, 06/24/97)
J. The capital facilities plan adopted by the City Council on August 22, 1995, is the capital facilities plan required
by Section 11-36-201 Utah Code Annotated that identifies demands placed upon existing public facilities by

Telecommunications System or providing Telecommunications Services using the Rights-of-Way, and every

Telecommunications Systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a Franchise
for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a
cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide Telecommunications Services over the same System, must also
obtain a Telecommunications Franchise.
(Ord. No. O-98-0009, Enacted, 02/10/98)
25-3-3. Nature of Grant.

Rights-of-Way on a non-exclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the Franchise;
the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased except as may be expressly provided in a Franchise
Agreement. A Franchise does not excuse a Provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment
agreements before collocating its System on the property of others, including the City's property. This section
shall not be construed to prohibit a Provider from leasing conduit to another Provider, so long as the Lessee has
obtained a Franchise.

Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any Provider acting without a Franchise on the effective
date of this Ordinance shall request issuance of a Franchise from the City within 90 days of the effective date of
this Ordinance. If such request is made, the Provider may continue providing service during the course of
negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a Franchise is not granted, the Provider
shall comply with the provisions of Section 25-9-4.

missing information within 90 days after the date of the written notification, the application will expire.
C. Processing Deadlines. The City shall approve or deny applications in accordance with the following deadlines:
1. Applications for the Collocation of Small Wireless Facilities shall be approved or denied within 60 days
after the day when the City receives a complete application. The City may extend the deadline by a single
additional period of 10 business days by sending the applicant written notice of the extension before the
applicable deadline.
2. Applications for new, modified, or replacement Utility Poles shall be approved or denied within 105 days
after the day when the City receives a complete application. The City may extend the deadline by a single
additional period of 10 business days by sending the applicant written notice of the extension before the
applicable deadline.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1213
D. Denial. If the City denies an application, the City shall provide the applicant with a written decision that
documents the basis for the denial, and shall send that decision to the applicant on or before the day that the City
denies the application. If the City denies an application for one or more Utility Poles, or one or more Small
Wireless Facilities in a consolidated application, the City shall not use that denial as a basis to delay the
application process for any other Utility Pole or Small Wireless Facility in the same consolidated application.
E. Resubmittal. Within 30 days after the day on which the City denies an application, the applicant may cure the
deficiencies noted in the denial resubmit the application without paying an application fee. The City shall approve
or deny the resubmitted application within 30 days of receipt, and shall limit its review to the deficiencies noted in
the original denial unless the applicant has changed another portion of the application.
F. Installation Deadline. A Site License will expire 270 days after approval if the licensed Small Wireless Facility or
Utility Pole is not installed and operational. The foregoing deadline will be tolled for any period of time during
which the lack of commercial power or communications facilities delays completion.

to ensure that construction begins within the twelve (12) month period, the owner shall post a cash bond
equal to ten percent (10%) of the purchase price of the Lot(s) purchased at the time the lot was
purchased. In the event construction is not begun within the twelve (12) month period and no extension is
granted, the Owner shall deed the property and all improvements thereon back to the Declarant, free of
all title defects and encumbrances of any kind, the Declarant shall pay to the Owner a sum equal to the
purchase price of the Lot, and the bond shall be forfeited to Declarant as liquidated damages. If

to a level of maintenance acceptable to the Committee. If in the Committee's opinion, the Owner has failed to
bring the Lot to any acceptable standard within such thirty (30) day period, the Committee may order the
necessary work performed on the Lot at the Owner's expense. Failure to properly maintain Improvements shall be
adequate grounds for revocation of the Conditional Use Permit by the City.

Parkway Crossing Executive Summery
Introduction
Summit Development is pleased to present Parkway Crossing, a student living community near Utah Valley State
College (UVSC) in Orem, Utah.
The recent and projected growth of UVSC has created a demand not only for nearby housing unit but also easy
accessibility to the various goods and services associated with student living. The integration of these two
elements is the inspiration behind Parkway Crossing.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1263
Summit Development has teamed with Holmes and Narver,
Inc., a leading design and architectural firm based in
Southern California and Sahara Construction of Bountiful,
Utah to transform the idea of this student housing village
into a reality. Grub and Ellis, who leased the Shops at
Riverwoods in Provo, will manage all aspects of leasing and
investment sales opportunities. Castlewood Development
will handle construction management as the project is built
and property management once Parkway Crossing becomes
available for student living.
Parkway Crossing has been designed with a campus villa
atmosphere to meet an array of needs that are part of the
student lifestyle in an attractive, walkable community.
This development is unique because it combines 1,789
student housing units (up to 6,000 student residents) with
105,965 sq. ft of retail and 160,000 sq. ft. of classroom, call
center, and multi-use space to accommodate vendors and
service providers who cater to college students.
Possible merchants include a grocery store, fitness center,
bank, copy center, retail and boutique shops,
entertainment centers, restaurants and cafes, and more.
Additionally, several convenient amenity areas will provide
recreation and entertainment opportunities for the student
residents.
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1264
The pressing need for more student housing near UVSC
has become very apparent. Kerry Romesberg, president
of UVSC, has commented, "If there were plentiful housing
around UVSC and it were inexpensive, I suspect them
would be a lot of UVSC and BYU students living there."2
With Parkway Crossing, Summit Development is
addressing this need. This project can accommodate the
housing needs for UVSC's growing population for years to
come.
The Community's Need
Orem's student population is growing rapidly. Utah
County's high quality of life, strong economy', and
large families have all contributed to a rapid increase
in the area's overall population.
While nearby Brigham Young University in Provo has
imposed an enrollment cap, UVSC has chosen to
uphold an open enrollment policy. UVSC currently
offers a variety of associates degrees and several
bachelor’s degrees. With the rapid growth the
college is experiencing, plans are underway for the
transition to a full four-year state university within
the next 5-8 years.
UVSC officials have indicated that the school has no
plans to limit the number of students who may
attend the school. In the past several years, UVSC has
seen an increase in the number of students at a rate
of approximately eight percent annually. Based on
the eight percent growth that has becn experienced
in recent years, the current student population of
22,000 students could reach 30,000 by 2005.
Orem's student housing needs have been absorbed
by communities around the valley, but Provo has
borne more than it's share of the increased demand.
Students seeking affordable housing and the religious
social atmosphere associated with BYU have
gravitated toward the many student apartment
complexes in Provo.

(Appendix A).
2. As quoted in "UVSC Looks at Housing Concerns" by Steven Gardner, The Daily Herald, May 7, 2000. (Appendix B).
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1265
Retail Opportunities
The retail opportunities are immense considering the
large and concentrated captive population that will
live at Parkway Crossing. Initial conservative
estimates place Parkway Crossing's population at
approximately 6,000 students. Combined with the
growing number of residents in surrounding single
family neighborhoods and nearby condominium
developments, a strong demand for retail and service
oriented businesses is evident.
The Amenities for the project will create a village center
with student and sport related activities, a focus on a
livable environment, retail shops, boutiques, food and
restaurants, and grocery. Jogging and walking trails and
landscaped outdoor lawn and gathering areas will
enhance many areas throughout the development.
Project Overview
The site is approximately 43.5 acres and borders the
west campus of Utah Valley State College (UVSC). It is
positioned between Geneva Road and Interstate 15,
just north of University Parkway in Orem, Utah. This
is directly west across the freeway from the main
campus of UVSC.
Vehicular access to the site is directly from University
Parkway and Geneva Road and is accompanied by
freeway access at University Parkway. The 1-15—
University Parkway interchange is currently under
construction and completion is expected in Fall 2001.
The new interchange will be a "Single Point Urban
Interchange" (SPUD design, and will facilitate easy
access to the site.
Given the need for increased student housing in the
area, this particular site has been identified by the
City of Orem as the primary location for UVSC
student housing in the city.
3) Parking
A multi-level parking structure will be provided for
student residents and guests and will meet the
requirements outlined by the City of Orem. In
addition, ample surface parking will be available for
non-resident retail visitors.
The project will be distinctive in character and will be
designed in a contemporary style with an old world
European flavor. The character will provide continuity
throughout Parkway Crossing. The elements to be
included are:
1) The Residential Development
a) Studio, 1, 2, 3, and 4 bedroom units, including:
i) A limited number of handicap-accessible
units
ii) A limited number of units for married
couples
b) Separate laundry facilities in each building
c) Common recreation areas
4) Site Circulation
A shuttle system will be provided to accommodate
students to and from UVSC year round during fair
and inclement weather. A convenient and efficient
shuttle system will reduce traffic congestion.
Additionally, an alternative transportation system
will be included in the project to transport students
City of Orem, UT - Code of Ordinance Page 1266
between
UVSC and Parkway Crossing. Based on the results of
a traffic study conducted by Fehr & Peers and
Associates, a gondola system appears to be the
most cost effective method of alternative
transportation available. This system would be
capable of transporting up to 5,000 individuals per
hour to and from the UVSC main campus.
d) Meeting spaces/multi-purpose area
e) Swimming pools
f) Hot tub(s)
g) Volleyball, tennis, and sport courts

also accommodate the growing student population for
years to come. Its unique blend of retail, housing, and
employment opportunities will also serve neighboring
residents and businesses and preserve the integrity of
single family neighborhoods in the area.
