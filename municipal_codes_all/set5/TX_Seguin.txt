PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Seguin, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1964 Code, as supplemented through September 5, 1989, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1964 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Jake Krauskopf, City Manager, Steve Kosub, City Attorney, Marilyn Sammons, Assistant to the City Manager, Linnette Habermann, City Secretary and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Charter of the City of Seguin, as adopted by referendum on Nov. 9, 1971, and Ordinance Number 1971-41 adopted December 7, 1971. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from Ordinance Number 1971-41. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

PREAMBLE 
    We, the Citizens of Seguin, Texas, in order to establish a Home Rule Municipal Government, provide for the future progress of our city and obtain more fully the benefits of local self-government, do hereby adopt this Home Rule Charter. 
ARTICLE I. - FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND BOUNDARIES 

Section 1.01. - Form of government.

    It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city that the compensation due a councilmember pursuant to Section 3.04 of the City Charter shall be offset by any amounts due by such councilmember on account of delinquency in payment of city taxes. In connection with this policy, the city financial director is hereby directed as follows: 
(1)  On March 1 of each year, the financial director shall review the city property tax records and assess whether a delinquency in payment of city property taxes exists for each councilmember. In the event a councilmember is in arrears in payment of city taxes, the financial director shall give written notice to the delinquent councilmember of the existence and the amount of the arrearage. The notice shall further state that unless the councilmember's tax account is brought current on or before the twentieth day of March, said councilmember's monthly compensation will be offset by all such amounts owing until said councilmember's tax account is paid in full. The notice shall be delivered to the councilmember via first class, regular, pre-paid mail. 
(2)  Immediately prior to issuance of councilmember compensation for March, the financial director shall review the property tax records of each councilmember so notified under subsection (1) and shall assess whether the delinquent councilmember's account has been brought current. If the tax account has been brought current, the financial director shall take no further action. If the tax account has not been brought current, the financial director shall immediately offset the compensation due the councilmember by the arrearage owed to the city. If the amount of the offset is less than the compensation due the councilmember, the financial director shall deduct the amount of the offset and pay the councilmember the balance. If the amount of the offset is more than the compensation due the councilmember, the financial director shall offset the entire amount due the councilmember and shall continue to offset all future compensation due the councilmember until such time as the balance due the city is paid in full. 
(3)  This section shall not apply to taxes due on property for which a written pay-out arrangement has been entered into between the councilmember and the authorized tax collector for the city. 
(4)  At any time during the calendar year, should the financial director become aware of any other delinquency in payment of city taxes on behalf of a councilmember, including any delinquency in or failure to pay under a pay-out arrangement with the authorized city tax collector, the financial director shall proceed to offset said councilmember's compensation in accordance with the above provisions; except that no offset shall be allowed unless and until at least ten days' written notice of intent to offset has been given to the affected councilmember. 
(5)  The terms "arrearage", "delinquency", "balance due" and "tax account" shall be construed to include all accrued interest and applicable penalties as provided by law.

Editor's note- An amendment dated November 10, 2003, enacted new provisions to be designated as §§ 107-1-107-17.

Original section designation has been maintained in the history notes following the sections. 

Sec. 2-151. - Policy. 
    It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officers and employees be independent, impartial and responsible only to the people of the city; that no officers, employees or members of any standing committee or board shall permit any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engagement in any business, transaction or professional activity to conflict with the proper discharge of their duties in the public interest; that public office not be used for illegal or improper personal gain; and that the city council at all times shall be maintained as a nonpartisan body. To implement such a policy, the city council deems it advisable to enact a standard of conduct for all officers and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, to serve not only as a guide for official conduct of the city's public servants, but also as a basis for discipline for those who refuse to abide by its terms, the overriding interest being that officers and employees of the city shall at all times strive to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. 
    The city further recognizes that public servants are also members of society and, therefore, cannot and should not be without any personal and economic interest in the decisions and policies of government; that public servants retain their rights as citizens to interests of a personal or economic nature, and their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest. It is not the intent of this article to thwart the opportunity of public servants to enjoy their rights as citizens of the community.

(a)  All new or upgraded grease interceptor designs, both aboveground and in-ground, must incorporate a clean-out inspection port on the influent drain line immediately prior to the grease trap and on the effluent drain line immediately after the grease trap, and a sampling port on the effluent drain line within one foot of the property line or other location as accepted by the authority having jurisdiction. The inspection or sampling port on the effluent drain line shall be located downstream and beyond all branch connections to the main yard line. If the user has more than one-yard line connected to the city's sanitary sewer, a sampling port or manhole must be constructed on each yard line. A manhole lid cover is required over the influent and effluent side of the grease trap. 
(b)  All designs must be approved by the wastewater treatment plant superintendent prior to installation in accordance with the following procedures: 
1.  Prior to the installation of an interceptor, the installer shall provide an accurate drawing of the interceptor, giving dimensions, and a drawing showing the location of the interceptor on the property in relation to the building being served, the property lines, the location and sizes of all plumbing lines, taps, clean-out and inspection port. 
2.  Calculations shall be provided that determine the proper size interceptor to be used. 
3.  All aboveground (under-sink) interceptors shall be constructed of suitable material (i.e. fiberglass or stainless steel). It is generally recognized that above ground interceptors will require considerable more maintenance than in ground types. 
(6)  Inspections. All food establishments shall allow the city ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the grease interceptor for the purpose of sampling and inspections. At the time of inspection, city staff will require that all interceptors be opened for visual inspection and that maintenance records be available for review. It is important that each interceptor be so installed that it is readily accessible for removal of cover, servicing and maintenance. 
(7)  Discharge, disposal, and monitoring. Each grease trap pumped shall be fully evacuated unless the trap volume is greater than the tank capacity on the vacuum truck, in which case the transporter shall arrange for additional transportation capacity so that the trap is fully evacuated within a 24-hour period, in accordance with 30 Texas Administrative Code § 312.143. 
(8)  Self-cleaning. 
(a)  Removal of grease in an exterior grease trap consists of scooping or pumping out accumulated grease at the surface, and settled material at the bottom. Removal or grease from a self-cleaning internal grease separator consists of dumping grease from the self-cleaning container into an approved grease receptacle to be hauled away. None of the removed matter can be disposed of in the sewer or storm sewer. Collected grease can be put in a grease recycle receptacle and hauled away by vendor. 
(b)  In order to facilitate cleaning, clear access is essential. All indoor interceptors shall not be cleaned during operating hours. In the case of 24-hour operations, indoor interceptors shall be cleaned at a time that is least busy. 
(c)  All undersink grease traps shall be self-cleaning and grease container shall be dumped according to paragraph (9), cleaning schedules. 
(9)  Cleaning schedules. 
(a)  Indoor interceptor cleaning schedule. Cleaning requirements for the undersink grease trap interceptors will be on a case-by-case basis. In general, cleaning will be required monthly or as deemed necessary by the wastewater treatment superintendent and his or her authorized representative. Log sheets supplied by the City of Seguin showing information such as dates and times the grease is removed from the grease trap and disposed of along with a signature of the responsible person shall be required. The log sheet must be kept up-to-date, completed, and faxed to the City of Seguin once a month at 830-401-2324 or mailed to 205 North River, City of Seguin, TX 78155 "Attn: Wastewater Treatment Department" on the fax or envelope. 
(b)  Exterior grease traps and grease interceptors subject to these standards shall be completely evacuated a minimum of every 120 days, or more frequently when deemed necessary by the Wastewater Treatment Superintendent. 
(c)  Any person who owns or operates a grease trap/interceptor may submit to the wastewater treatment plant superintendent a request in writing for an exception to the 120-day pumping frequency of their grease trap/interceptor. The wastewater treatment plant superintendent may grant an extension for required cleaning frequency on a case-by-case basis when: 
1.  The grease trap/interceptor owner/operator has demonstrated the specific trap/interceptor will produce an effluent, based on defensible analytical results, in consistent compliance with established local discharge limits such as COD or other parameters as determined by the city; or 
2.  Less than 25 percent of the wetted height of the grease trap or grease interceptor, as measured from the bottom of the devise to the invert of the outlet pipe, contains floating materials, sediment, oils or greases. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a grease trap and grease interceptor shall be fully evacuated, cleaned and inspected at least once every 180 days. 
(10)  Grease interceptor and wastewater management techniques. 
(a)  Grease traps shall be maintained in efficient operating condition by periodic removal of the accumulated grease. No collected grease shall be introduced into any drainage piping, or public or private sewer. 
(b)  Grease trap maintenance. Each grease trap [shall] be subject to random inspection by a representative from the city. If in the representative's opinion, the trap requires more frequent cleanings, the food establishment shall comply with this request. 
The following documentation is required at the time of city inspection. 
1.  The name, address and phone number of the hauler/renderer. 
2.  The location of the designated disposal site. 
3.  Receipts indicating the date the interceptor was serviced. 
4.  A complete description of the work performed. 
(c)  All servicing, cleaning, pumping out and transporting shall be in accordance with Title 31, Ch. 312, Texas Administrative Code, and conducted in a manner which will prevent leakage, spillage, or creation of a sanitary nuisance or health hazard. Records shall be kept available for inspection by the city. 
(11)  Manifest requirements. 
(a)  Persons and/or facilities that generate, collect and transport grease waste shall maintain a record of each individual collection and deposit. Such records shall be in the form of a manifest. The manifest shall include: 
1.  Name, address, telephone, and commission registration number of transporter; 
2.  Name, signature, address, and phone number of the person who generated the waste and the date collected; 
3.  Type and amount(s) of waste collected or transported; 
4.  Name and signature(s) of responsible person(s) collecting, transporting, and depositing the waste; 
5.  Date and place where the waste was deposited; 
6.  Identification (permit or site registration number, location, and operator) of the facility where the waste was deposited; 
7.  Name and signature of facility on-site representative acknowledging receipt of the waste and the amount of waste received; 
8.  The volume of the grease waste received; and 
9.  A consecutive numerical tracking number to assist transporters, waste generators, and regulating authorities in tracking the volume of grease transported. 
(b)  A copy of all manifests shall be kept on sight available for city inspection. 
1.  All parts of the manifest shall have all required information completely filled out and signed by the appropriate party. 
2.  One copy shall go to the transporter, who shall retain a copy of all manifests showing the collection and disposal of waste. 
3.  One copy of the manifest shall be returned by the transporter to the person who generated the wastes within 15 days after the waste is received at the disposal or processing facility. 
(c)  Copies of manifests returned to the waste generator shall be retained for five years and be readily available for review by the city. 
(d)  The customer/owner will be responsible for sending another copy of the grease waste hauling manifest to the wastewater treatment department even when the vat or drum is shared by multiple customers/owners. Each customer/owner will have to supply an individual copy of the manifest to verify the grease removal is properly being disposed of each month. A copy of the manifest must be faxed to 830-401-2324 or mailed to 205 North River, City of Seguin, TX 78155, each needs have "Attn: Wastewater Treatment Department" on the fax or envelope. 
(12)  Alternative treatment. 
(a)  The use of enzyme, chemical, or other products designed to emulsify, or by any other means render grease soluble for the purpose of cleaning drain lines shall not be used to replace, or substitute for an approved grease interceptor. 
(b)  A person commits an offense if the person introduces, or causes, permits, or suffers the introduction of any surfactant, solvent, or emulsifier into a grease trap. Surfactants, solvents, and emulsifiers are materials which allow the grease to pass from the trap into the collection system, and include but are not limited to enzymes, soap, diesel, kerosene, terpene, and other solvents. 
(c)  It is an affirmative defense to an enforcement of subsection (3) that the use of surfactants or soaps is incidental to normal kitchen hygiene operations. 
(d)  Bioremediation media may be used with the wastewater treatment plant superintendent's approval if the person has proved to the satisfaction of the superintendent that laboratory testing which is appropriate for the type of grease trap to be used has verified that: 
1.  The media is a pure live bacterial product which is not inactivated by the use of domestic or commercial disinfectants and detergents, strong alkalis, acids, and/or water temperatures of 160 degrees F, (71 degrees C). 
2.  The use of the media does not reduce the buoyancy of the grease layer in the grease trap and does not increase the potential for oil and grease to be discharged to the sanitary sewer. 
3.  The use of the bioremediation media does not cause foaming in the sanitary sewer. 
4.  The COD discharged to the sanitary sewer after use of the media does not exceed the COD which would be discharged if the product were not being used and the grease trap was being properly maintained; in addition, pH levels must be between six and nine. 
(e)  All testing designed to satisfy the criteria set forth in this section shall be scientifically sound and statistically valid. All tests to determine oil and grease, COD, pH, and other pollutant levels shall use appropriate tests which have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and which are defined in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 136 or Title 30, Texas Administrative Code § 319.11. Testing shall be open to inspection by the city, and shall meet the city's approval. 
(13)  Enforcement. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be subject to a written warning for the first violation, a $1,000.00 civil penalty for the second violation, a $1,500.00 civil penalty for the third violation, and a $2,000.00 civil penalty for the fourth violation within a two-year period. Further violations will result in successive $500.00 increases in the civil penalty and may result in termination of sewer service and/or revocation of the food establishment's food service license.

Sec. 22-162. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds that: 
(1)  The Legislature of the State of Texas has determined that sexually oriented businesses such as the businesses regulated in this chapter may be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of a community by contributing to the decline of neighborhoods and contributing to the growth of criminal activity. 
(2)  The Legislature of the State of Texas has granted cities authority to regulate sexually oriented businesses in Chapter 243, Texas Local Government Code. 
(3)  The city, as a home-rule city, has other authority under the Texas Constitution and Local Government Code to enforce ordinances to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. 
(4)  A number of studies have found that adult oriented businesses (a/k/a sexually oriented businesses) have an adverse secondary effect on property values, contribute to an increased crime rate in neighborhoods containing these businesses, cause an increase in sex-related crimes in such neighborhoods, and show a compounding of adverse secondary effects when two or more adult oriented businesses are located in close proximity.

(5)  The city council finds and determines, based on these studies, that the regulation of adult oriented businesses is necessary to control and limit these adverse secondary effects. 
(6)  The studies that have been presented show that because of their very nature, adult oriented businesses can and should be relegated to nonresidential and non-retail zoning districts. 
(7)  The city council has heard testimony that adequate alternate avenues of communication exist, in that sufficient land is available in the city limits for placement of adult oriented businesses that are located within the permitted zoning districts set out in the Seguin Unified Development Code. 
(8)  Sexually transmitted diseases are a legitimate public health concern, and the studies that the city council has reviewed from other cities show that these diseases can be controlled to a certain extent by regulation of certain aspects of adult oriented businesses. The city council finds and determines, based on these studies, that the regulation of adult oriented businesses is necessary to control and limit these adverse secondary effects. 
(b)  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate adult businesses in order to control their adverse secondary effects in the community. The purpose of this chapter is neither to deny access to or communications of materials protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, nor to condone or legitimize such materials.

ARTICLE VII. - OIL AND GAS DRILLING AND OPERATIONS 

Sec. 22-400. - Purpose, authority and applicability. 
(a)  Purpose. The drilling and production of gas and the development of gas well facilities within the corporate limits of the city necessitate promulgation of reasonable regulations to prevent devaluation of property; to protect watersheds; to prevent deleterious uses of groundwater resources that actually or potentially threaten the health of persons in proximity to drilling and production activities; to prevent or moderate noxious emissions of gases that potentially threaten the health of nearby residents and employees; to prevent injury to persons and property; to ensure that gas well drilling and production activities are compatible with adjacent land uses throughout the duration of such activities; and to assure that such activities conform to the Seguin Plan. The regulations contained in this article are designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public and to assure that the orderly and practical development of mineral resources is compatible with the quiet enjoyment of affected surface estates. The regulations contained in this article are designed to implement the purposes set forth in this subsection and are supported by the following findings of fact: 
(1)  Gas well drilling and production activities create externalities that potentially threaten the health, safety and general welfare of persons residing or working on property in proximity to such operations. 
(2)  Gas well drilling and production activities, in the absence of local regulatory controls, may generate noxious aerial emissions, introduce contaminants into groundwater, emit high noise levels, produce large volumes of dust, congest local streets, present fire hazards and produce other deleterious effects, all of which fall disproportionately on adjacent land uses, and which can result individually or cumulatively in injury to persons and destabilization of property values in the vicinity of such operations. 
(3)  The City of Seguin recognizes that the United States and the State of Texas regulate gas well drilling and production activities for the purpose of implementing broad air quality and water quality goals. The regulations in this chapter are intended to supplement such standards in order to implement compatible local objectives that assure the health, safety and general welfare of the city's residents and businesses. 
(b)  Authority. This article is adopted pursuant to authority vested under the constitution and laws of the United States, the State of Texas and the City of Seguin. Each authorization identified in this article shall be construed as an exercise of the city's zoning powers, pursuant to the Seguin City Charter, Texas Local Government Code Chapters 211 and 212 and the applicable provisions of the Seguin Unified Development Code (the "UDC"). 
(c)  Applicability. The provisions of this article apply only within the corporate limits of the City of Seguin, except as otherwise stated in the UDC.

Sec. 22-401. - Definitions. 
    All technical industry words or phrases related to the drilling and production of gas wells not specifically defined shall have the meanings customarily attributable thereto by prudent operators in the gas industry. For the purposes of this article, the following definitions, without regard to whether the defined terms are capitalized when used, shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning: 
    Ambient noise level. An all-encompassing noise level associated with a given environment. A composite of sounds from all sources (excluding the noise in question) at the location and approximate time at which a comparison with the noise in question is to be made. In this context, the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location. The ambient noise level is established by recording sounds from all sources (excluding the noise in question) over a continuous 72-hour period at the location prior to drilling. The 72-hour time span shall include at least one 24-hour reading during either a Saturday or Sunday. 
    Blowout preventer (BOP). A mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic apparatus, or combination of such apparatus, that can be secured over top of an open wellbore, or drill pipe or casing tubular that, via remote actuators, can be actuated remotely in the event that an emergency well control situation arises. The primary function of the BOP is to shut the well and to regain pressure control of the formation fluids from blowing out of the well. 
    Closed-loop mud system. A system that uses a combination of solids control equipment incorporated in a series of steel tanks that eliminates the use of a pit. 
    Commencement of drilling activities. The reflection of either "spud well" or "nipple up" the blowout protectors (BOP) by the drilling contractor on the IADC-API Daily Drilling Report Form maintained by the operator's tool pusher on the pad site. 
    Completion combustion device. Any ignition device, installed horizontally or vertically, used in exploration and production operations to combust otherwise vented emissions from completions. 
    Completion of drilling, re-drilling and re-working. The date the work is completed for drilling, re-drilling, or re-working, and the crew is released by completing its work or contracted by its employer. 
    Contaminant. Any substance capable of contaminating a non-related homogeneous material, fluid, gas or environment. 
    Daytime. The period from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday; and from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Saturdays and Sundays. 
    Delineation well. A well drilled in order to determine the boundary of a field or producing reservoir. 
    Drilling. Term used to typically describe the means by which the earth is bored to create a pathway to formations containing hydrocarbons to allow for their production to the surface. It can employ various types of mobilized drilling equipment to create a wellbore while incorporating drilling fluids to cool the bit, to condition the hole, to remove drilled cuttings and, most critically, to maintain an overbalanced pressure gradient against the formation that may contained inherently pressurized well fluids. 
    Drilling and production site (a/k/a gas well park, gas well pad site, and drilling and production area). The area dedicated to all gas well drilling or production activities, or both, including the drilling and production area, all structures, closed-loop systems, dehydrators, parking areas, security cameras, lighting, tanks, tank battery (or any other tank grouping area), drilling rigs, separators, compressors, perimeter walls, utilities, and all other features or objects contemplated for use during and after gas well drilling or production activities, as designated on the gas well development plat or gas well development site plan. Excluded from this definition are gathering and transmission lines and compressor stations.

d.  Tree mitigation for gas wells located in an ESA shall be required and shall be calculated on a one-to-one replacement value for 100 percent of the dbh of trees removed from the drilling and production site. Tree mitigation shall be accomplished by planting replacement trees, within a floodplain, on-site or off-site with similar tree species or by payment into a tree mitigation fund. Tree mitigation funds that are specific to ESAs will be kept separate from other tree mitigation funds and will only be used to either acquire wooded floodplain or riparian property that remains in a naturalistic state in perpetuity, or to purchase conservation easements within riparian or floodplain areas. Funds may be used to purchase, plant, and maintain trees on public property, as long as the public property is within a riparian area or floodplain. 
e.  The watershed protection permit application shall contain the following information and such information as may be required by the development review committee which is reasonably necessary to review and determine whether the proposed development and required facilities meet the requirements of this article and as required by the application criteria manual. The information that is required for the watershed protection permit shall include, but not be limited to: 
1.  A tree inventory plan shall show the location of ESAs on any proposed drilling and production site. 
2.  Any request to remove tree(s) shall be accompanied by a letter from a certified geologist or engineer that indicates why the well site cannot be located to avoid the trees. If operator has chosen to pay into the tree mitigation fund, such funds shall be paid prior to final approval of a drilling and production site within an ESA. 
3.  Show location of ESAs on proposed drilling and production sites. 
g.  Only one well head may be placed in the flood way or ESA under the following conditions: 
1.  Storage tanks or separation facilities shall be constructed at least 18 inches above the established base flood elevation plus the surcharge depth for encroachment to the limits of the floodway having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. 
2.  A hydrologic and hydraulic engineering study shall be performed by a registered professional engineer. The study shall be submitted to the engineering department in a technical report for review by the city engineer or his designated representative. The report shall demonstrate that the proposed facilities will have no adverse impacts on the carrying capacity of the adjacent waterway nor cause any increases to the elevations established for the floodplain. When the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) on the subject site is designated as "Zone A" on the FIRM panel, or the SFHA is not identified on the FIRM panel, the following approximate method may be used to evaluate the impacts from gas well development. A flow rate shall be calculated using procedures set forth in the City of Seguin Drainage Criteria Manual. Using Manning's Equation with an estimate of the average slope of the stream, measurements of a single irregular cross-section geometry at the well site, and the 100-year discharge rate, the average velocity and normal depth may be calculated. Calculations shall be provided for the unaltered existing channel cross-section and for the proposed modified channel cross-section and submitted to the city for review and approval prior to construction within these areas. 
3.  No more than ten percent of the floodplain, within the limits of the gas well development site plan or gas well development plat, may be filled. 
h.  If evidence from water quality monitoring efforts indicates that contamination is occurring from gas wells, the operator shall remove, cause to be removed, or otherwise remediate contamination, as required by the oil and gas inspector including but not limited to waste minimization practices established by the RRC. Cleanup operations shall begin immediately. A re-inspection fee shall be charged as established by the city council and published in the application criteria manual.

a.  Standard of review for appeals. The members of the board of adjustment shall have and exercise the authority to hear and determine appeals where it is alleged there is error or abuse of discretion regarding the approval or denial of a gas well development site plan, or the issuance or non-issuance of a gas well permit. 
b.  Standard of review for variances. In deciding variance requests, the board of adjustment shall consider, where applicable, the following relevant criteria: 
1.  Whether there are special circumstances existing on the property on which the application is made related to size, shape, area, topography, surrounding conditions and location that do not apply generally to other property in the vicinity; 
2.  Whether a variance is necessary to permit the applicant the same rights in the use of his property that are presently enjoyed by other similarly situated properties, but which rights are denied to the property on which the application is made; 
3.  Whether the granting of the variance on the specific property will adversely affect any other feature of the comprehensive master plan of the town; 
4.  Whether the variance, if granted, will be of no material detriment to the public welfare or injury to the use, enjoyment, or value of property in the vicinity; 
5.  Whether the operations proposed are reasonable under the circumstances and conditions prevailing in the vicinity considering the particular location and the character of the improvements located there; 
6.  Whether the drilling of the maximum number of potential wells for the proposed drill site would conflict with the orderly growth and development of the town; 
7.  Whether there are other alternative well site locations; 
8.  Whether the operations proposed are consistent with the health, safety and welfare of the public when and if conducted in accordance with the oil, gas, or combined well permit conditions to be imposed; 
9.  Whether the operations proposed are consistent with protecting the ecological integrity and environmental quality, including protection of surface and ground water sources, of potentially impacted environmentally sensitive areas; 
10.  Whether there is reasonable access for town fire personnel and firefighting equipment, including the ability to safely evacuate potentially affected residents; 
11.  Whether the impact upon the adjacent property(ies) and the general public by operations conducted in compliance with the oil, gas, or combined well permit conditions are reasonable and justified, balancing the following factors: 
A.  The reasonable use of the mineral estate by the mineral estate owner(s) to explore, develop, and produce the minerals; and 
B.  The availability of alternative drilling sites; and 
12.  Where a variance is requested to reduce separation standards in subsection 22-403(a)(l), in addition to other relevant criteria, the extent to which owners of protected uses, or freshwater wells currently in use, or previously platted subdivision where one or more lots have habitable structures, have consented to the reduction in separation standards in writing. 
c.  The board of adjustment shall determine whether to grant an extension of the expiration date for a gas well development site plan or gas well permit based upon whether there are circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the operator, including any delay on the part of the city in issuing subsequent permits, that justify an extension of the site plan or permit, in order that the operator may enjoy the same rights in the use of the property that are presently enjoyed by other similarly situated properties, but which rights are denied to the property for which the site plan or permit expires. 
(2)  The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the oil and gas inspector's order, requirement, decision or determination from which an appeal is taken and make the correct order, requirement, decision or determination from which an appeal is taken and make the correct order, requirement, decision or determination. The board of adjustment may issue a variance to the applicant under the criteria referenced in subsection (a)(1)b., and may grant a special exception under the criteria referenced in subsection (a)(1)c. Any action under this subsection shall require a three-fourths majority vote of the entire board of adjustment. 
(3)  Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, stating that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and specifying the grounds of the alleged illegality. Such petition shall be presented within ten days after the date on which the decision of the board of adjustment was rendered and not thereafter, and judicial review of the petition shall be pursuant to Texas Local Government Code, § 211.011, as amended. 
(b)  Watershed permit appeals. 
(1)  The applicant may appeal the denial or conditional approval of a watershed protection permit on grounds pertaining to the standards in subsections 22-403(a)(6) and 22-403(a)(8) to the planning and zoning commission within ten calendar days of the decision by the DRC.

(2)  The applicant may file a petition for review pursuant to subsections 22-403(a)(6) and 22-403(a)(8) on grounds therein specified to the city council within ten calendar days of the decision by the planning and zoning commission. The council shall decide the petition based upon the criteria in subsections 22-403(a)(6) and 22-403(a)(8). 
(c)  Preemption appeal. 
(1)  Purpose. The regulation of gas well drilling and production in this subsection potentially overlaps with regulation of gas well drilling and production by the State of Texas and the United States of America. The purpose of this section is to afford operators the opportunity to demonstrate to the city that one or more standards or procedures contained in this subchapter are preempted by state or federal law. 
(2)  Petition contents. An operator who is aggrieved by the promulgation or application of the standards or procedures in this subsection and who claims that one or more such standards or procedures are preempted by state or federal law shall submit a petition to the oil and gas well inspector explaining the factual and legal bases upon which the operator relies to support his contention that a regulation in this subchapter is preempted. The petition shall be accompanied by an unconditional waiver of any statutory time periods or time periods established by ordinance for review of any filed applications which are the subject of the petition. The petition shall include, at a minimum, the following: 
a.  The name, mailing address, phone number and fax number of the person (or the person's duly authorized agent); 
b.  Identification of all property owned or under the control of the operator that is affected by the preemption claim; 
c.  Identification of the permit applications for which the applicant seeks relief under this section; 
d.  Identification of all regulations in this subchapter that the petitioner contends do not apply to the project due to preemption of the subject matter by state or federal law; 
e.  For each regulation in this subchapter that is the subject of the operator's preemption claim, specification of the state or federal law, standard, administrative rule or order that allegedly preempts the regulation, together with an explanation of why such law, standard, administrative rule or order preempts the regulation. 
(3)  Procedure and decision. The oil and gas inspector shall first determine whether the application is complete. Once the application has been determined to be or is deemed complete, the director shall forward the preemption petition, together with the required supporting information or documentation, to the city manager and city attorney for their respective reviews. Prior to rendering his final determination, the city manager may request a pre-determination conference with the petitioner to discuss the preemption claim and to ensure that the nature of the claim is fully and completely understood by the city manager. The city manager, after consultation with the city attorney, shall render a final administrative determination that grants the relief requested in the petition in whole or in part, or denies the requested relief in whole or in part within 30 days of the date the petition is complete. The city manager's determination shall include a statement of the reasons for the decision, and shall identify the regulations that are preempted on their face or as applied to the petitioner's permit application(s) for approval under this section. The city manager may also recommend to the city council that one or more regulations contained in this subchapter should be repealed or modified so as to avoid other preemption claims.

If the court so finds, the court shall order the reporter to prepare the record without charge to the defendant. Before the recorded proceedings are transcribed, the defendant shall, unless found by the court to be unable to pay for the reporter's record, post a cash deposit with the municipal court for the estimated cost of the record.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 54-1-54-25. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 54-26. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has in V.T.C.A. Water Code Ch. 16.315 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council does ordain as provided in this article. 
(Code 1964, § 121/2-1; Ord. No. 07-95, § 1, 10-2-07) 
Sec. 54-27. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to the lands because they are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 1964, § 121/2-2) 
Sec. 54-28. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood-blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Code 1964, § 121/2-3) 
Sec. 54-29. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, the following methods are used in this article: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities. 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage. 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1964, § 121/2-4)

Sec. 54-41. - Variances procedures. 
(a)  The appeal board as established by the city shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The appeal board may hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this article. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing relevant factors in section 54-40(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article (section 54-28). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon, (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in subsections 54-41(a)-(k) are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(Code 1964, § 121/2-35) 
Sec. 54-52. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 54-32, 54-39(8) or 54-53(c), the following are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in section 54-40(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(a)  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed are subject to flooding shall be provided. 
(b)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
(c)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes: 
(a)  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring for resisting wind forces. 
(b)  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to a minimum of one foot above base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(c)  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of subsection 54-40(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

Sec. 54-53. - Subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections 54-27 through 54-29. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of section 54-33, section 54-40 and section 54-51 of this article. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 54-32 or 54-39(8). 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Code 1964, § 121/2-37; Ord. No. 00-20, 2-28-00) 
Sec. 54-54. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-32 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
(a)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
(b)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone level, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in subsection 54-40(a)(1), are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Code 1964, § 121/2-38; Ord. No. 07-95, § 1, 10-2-07) 
Sec. 54-55. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-32 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Code 1964, § 121/2-39; Ord. No. 07-95, § 1, 10-2-07) 
Sec. 54-56. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this article is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 07-95, § 1, 10-2-07) 
Sec. 54-57. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
(1)  No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this court order and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this court order by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this court order or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than the maximum allowed by law for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city council from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(2)  Penalty for violation. Any person violating any provision of chapter 54, floods, incorporated by reference in this section shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-14.

A "peddler" does not include a person who distributes handbills or flyers for a commercial purpose, advertising an event, activity, good or service that is offered to the resident for purchase at a location away from the residence or at a time different from the time of the visit. Such a person is a "solicitor".

No person shall act as a peddler, hawker, or solicitor within the city without first obtaining a peddler license in accordance with this section. A canvasser is not required to have a peddler license but any canvasser wanting a peddler license for the purpose of reassuring city residents of the canvasser's good faith shall be issued a permit upon request. It is an offense to act as a peddler, hawker, or solicitor within the city without first obtaining a peddler's license. 
(4)  Fee. The fee for the issuance of each peddler license is set forth in Appendix C, Fees, except that: 
A canvasser requesting a peddler's license, no fee shall be required.

Each person seeking a peddler's license must personally appear at the Seguin Police Department.

(a)  Name of applicant. 
(b)  A driver's license, state identification card, passport, or other government-issued identification card (issued within the United States) containing the name, physical description, and photograph of the applicant.

During the time following the application for one or more peddler licenses and it issuance, the city shall investigate as to the truth and accuracy of the information contained in the application. If the city has not completed this investigation within 48 business hours as set forth in subsection (5), the identification card will nonetheless be issued, subject, however, to administrative revocation upon completion of the investigation. If a canvasser requests a peddler's license, the investigation will proceed as described above, but if the city refuses to issue the peddler's license (or revokes it after issuance), the canvassers will be advised that the failure to procure a peddler's license does not prevent him or her from canvassing the residents of the city. 
(8)  Revocation of license. 
(a)  Grounds. Any license issued hereunder may be revoked if the license holder is convicted of a violation of any provision of this section or has knowingly made a false material statement in the application or otherwise becomes disqualified for the issuance of a license under the terms of this section. Additionally, if a license holder is convicted of a felony or of an offense of moral turpitude during the term of the license, license holder shall notify the Seguin Police Department of such conviction and shall be required to submit a new license application.

After holding the hearing on the revocation or denial, the city council shall, by majority vote, either sustain the action or issue an order reinstating the license. 
(d)  In the event of the filing of an appeal from a revocation issued under the provisions of this article, then until such appeal has been determined by the city council such revocation order shall be stayed. 
(9)  Hearing on appeal. If the applicant requests a hearing, the hearing shall be held in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act of the State of Texas, and review from the decision (on the record of the hearing) shall be had to the county court in which the city is located. The hearing shall also be subject to the Texas Open Meeting Act.

Each peddler's license shall be worn on the outer clothing of the individual for whom it was issued so as to be reasonable visible to any person who might be approached by said person.

(11)  Validity of peddler's license. A peddler's license shall be valid within the meaning of this section for a period of one year from its date of issuance or the term requested, whichever is less.

(2)  When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the rights of assembly.

(7)  Each of the foregoing exceptions are severable and in addition other possible exceptions may be added hereto in the future as warranted by experience as illuminated by the views of student government associations, school personnel, citizens, neighborhood spokesman, parents, officers, and persons in authority concerned positively with minors as well as juvenile delinquency. 
(b)  With respect to section 70-33(b), a minor shall not be deemed in violation of such section, when the offense occurred during the scheduled vacation of or on a holiday observed by the school in which the minor is enrolled; or when the minor has graduated from high school or received a high school equivalency certificate; or when the minor has permission to be absent from school or be in a public place from an authorized school official.

(a)  A police officer, upon finding or having his attention called to any minor in or on a public place or in or on the premises of a business establishment in prima facie violation of this article, may, if there exists reasonable grounds to believe the minor has engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision in accordance with V.T.C.A., Family Code §§ 51.03 and 52.01, take the minor into custody. A parent shall be immediately notified to pick up the minor upon his arrival at the police department.

A police officer may also issue a warning notice to the minor in accordance with V.T.C.A., Family Code § 52.01 and order such minor to go directly and promptly to his home. 
(b)  Upon picking up a minor in custody, the parent shall be interrogated about the circumstances of such activity by the minor. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts and to centralize responsibility for accurate, effective, fair and impartial and uniform enforcement and recording, thus making available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and, if required, referral to social agencies equipped to handle family problems that may be disclosed by investigation. In the absence of convincing identification, a police officer on the street may use his best judgment in determining age. Police procedures shall be constantly refined in the light of experience, and changes in this section may be made on the basis of such experience. 
(c)  In any event, a police officer shall within 24 hours file a written report on the incident involving the minor or shall participate to the extent possible in the preparation and filing of such report by his supervisor. 
(d)  When a parent has come to take charge of a minor and the appropriate information has been received, the minor shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the minor, the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities. However, the police department shall have the discretion to refuse to turn the child over to persons other than the natural parents or legal guardians, if circumstances warrant such refusal in their opinion. 
(e)  For a violation by a minor not resulting in custody at the police department, the police department shall by certified mail notify the parents of the minor involved of the violation and include a warning that subsequent violations will result in full enforcement of this article, including the enforcement of parental responsibility by criminal action.

Sec. 70-120. - Purpose.

(c)  The presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks, automated teller machines, public transportation facilities, and crosswalks is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in a place that is confined, difficult to avoid, or where a person might find it necessary to wait. 
(d)  The presence of individuals soliciting funds at busy street corners during rush hour and noon time traffic can be a safety hazard. 
(e)  This section is intended to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation, and not to limit a constitutionally protected activity.

The franchisee shall pay any additional amount due to the city as a result of the city's review or audit within 30 days following written notice to the franchisee. In addition to the right to review the records, the city shall have the right to select an independent accounting firm to audit the books and records of the franchisee to determine compliance with this article and the franchise agreement. The costs of the audit, if requested by the city, shall be paid by the city; provided, however, that in the event the audit reveals an error in franchisee's reporting of gross revenues by a margin of greater than three percent, then the cost of the audit shall be paid by the franchisee.

For the purposes of default, the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement shall include the sections setting forth quality of service and handling of complaints.

(b)  It shall be the responsibility of the permit holder to provide, erect, place and maintain all warning signs, traffic control devices and barricades required by the state manual on uniform traffic control devices or the manager of public works of the city. All such signs, devices and barricades should be in good condition, clean and legible and shall be of the type required by the state manual on uniform traffic control devices. When additional regulatory signs are deemed necessary by the manager of public works, such signing will be installed as directed by the public works department along with such regulatory signs as are required to be provided by the city as required by the manual. 
(Code 1964, § 22-50) 
Sec. 90-94. - Contractor's barricading plan. 
(a)  Any contractor undertaking any work, whether of his own or under contract for any other person, and such work is within a city street and requires that a set of plans be drawn up due to the extensive or complex nature of the work will be subject to this section and must file for a permit before beginning construction. Proof must also be shown that he has obtained approval by other affected agencies of the city to actually perform the work. 
(b)  A plan must be prepared, if required by the manager of public works, by the contracting agency showing where work is to be performed. The plan will include a standard barricading layout showing placement of barricades, cones and informational signs used on the project. In most cases, layouts will be similar to those shown in the latter part of the manual. Deviation from the manual will be allowed only with approval of the manager of public works or his appointed representative. 
(c)  The plan must be submitted a minimum of five business days prior to actual beginning of the construction work. This time period will allow the public works department the opportunity to survey the construction site in an attempt to uncover any traffic problems which might develop as a result of the barricading. 
(d)  Each contractor or construction agency will provide with his barricading plan a listing of all persons directly responsible for safety on each project, to include an address or a telephone listing at which the person can be reached at any hour of the day if a hazardous condition develops. 
(Code 1964, § 22-53(a)) 
Sec. 90-95. - Contract work by city-prepared construction plans. 
    If the contractor undertakes work based on plans prepared by the public works department under this article, all detour and barricading requirements will be inserted as part of the construction plans. In this situation, the contractor's acceptance of the construction project will serve as indication that he understands the layout and is responsible and subject to the penalties established in this article. 
(Code 1964, § 22-53(b)) 
Sec. 90-96. - Work done by city and public utility companies. 
(a)  All city forces as well as public utility companies performing construction work within a street under this article which requires that a set of plans be drawn up due to the extensive or complex nature of work will be subject to the same requirements established in section 90-94. Such work would include major street construction (street cuts, street widening, etc.), water and sewer line laying or relocation or offstreet construction which requires that a portion of the adjacent roadway be barricaded. 
(b)  Construction work performed by city forces or utility companies minor enough such that a set of plans need not be drawn up will not be subject to the same requirements established in section 90-94. Such work includes minor street construction (resurfacing, patching, striping), minor utility work (usage of manholes such that a lane must be barricaded), etc. These forces will be required, however, to comply with all other provisions set forth in the manual as to the construction site barricades layout and signing. In addition, the manager of public works or his authorized representative shall be contacted before the construction work is begun and shall be informed of the location and nature of construction. This work shall not be performed during the peak hour congestion periods of 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. unless approved by the manager of public works.

(Ord. No. 74-20, 8-6-74) 
Sec. 90-134. - Design criteria for drainage. 
(a)  Runoff calculations. 
(1)  Runoff rates shall be computed at not less than the following: 
PERCENT RUNOFF 
Character of Area Slope To 1% Over 1% Up to 3% Over 3% Up to 5% Over 5% Business or commercial area (90% or more impervious) 95 96 97 97 Densely developed area (80% to 90% impervious) 85 88 91 95 Closely built residential area 75 77 80 84 Average residential area 68 70 72 75 Undeveloped area 65 67 69 72  
(2)  In all instances, wet antecedent conditions shall be assumed. Runoff rates shall be computed on the basis of ultimate development of the entire watershed contributing runoff water to the proposed subdivision. For determination of time of concentration, velocities shall be assumed on the basis of concrete-lined channels and streets carrying stormwater in the contributing watershed area. Rainfall intensities shall be obtained from the state highway department data for Guadalupe County. 
(b)  Drainage facilities. 
(1)  Streets may be used for stormwater drainage only if the calculated stormwater flow does not exceed the flows outlined in Table I in this section, or the velocity does not exceed ten feet per second. Minor streets shall be designed on the basis of a ten-year storm frequency, and all other streets shall be designed on the basis of a 25-year storm frequency. Where streets are not capable of carrying stormwaters as outlined above, drainage ditches or storm sewers shall be provided. The runoff from a storm with a design frequency of 100 years shall be contained within the street right-of-way. 
(2)  All open channels shall be grass-lined. The design of the grass-lined channels shall be based on the 100-year frequency storm, for fully developed upstream conditions, subject to the approval of the city engineer. 
a.  Surface. The entire surface of the channel shall be vegetated. 
b.  Velocity. The maximum 100-year storm velocity shall not exceed six feet per second (fps). 
c.  Side slopes. Side slopes shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one vertical (3H:1V). 
d.  Bottom width. The minimum flat bottom width of the channel shall be six feet. 
e.  Grade. The channel should have a minimum grade of one percent, where possible. Channels with grades of less than one percent shall have a reinforced concrete pilot channel, located in the middle of the channel bottom, four feet wide, two inches deep, and be capable of withstanding vehicular loading. The longitudinal grade of the channel flow line shall not be less than 0.4 percent. 
f.  Curvature. The centerline curvature shall have a minimum radius of twice the top width of the 100-year storm flow. 
g.  Freeboard. All channels shall provide one foot of freeboard above the 100-year frequency storm normal water surface elevation. 
h.  Easements. Easements for grass-lined channels shall extend a minimum of two feet on one side and 15 feet on the opposite side of the extreme limits of the channel (when such channel does not abut an alley or street). When such channel abuts an alley or street, the easement shall extend a minimum of two feet on both sides of the extreme limits of the channel. Property owners shall be responsible for the normal mowing and maintenance of the channel. 
(3)  Concrete-lined channels may be needed in reaches where velocities are excessive or where the channel characteristics require such use. The design of the concrete-lined channels shall be based on the 100-year frequency storm, subject to the approval of the city engineer. Other appropriate channel armoring may be approved by the city engineer. 
a.  Lining height. The concrete lining shall extend one foot above the calculated 100-year water surface elevation, taking into consideration superelevation, standing waves, or other surface disturbances. 
b.  Side slopes. Since concrete-lined channels do not require slope maintenance, the side slopes may be as steep as vertical with appropriate structural methods applied. 
c.  Grade. The flow line of the channel shall be no less than 0.4 percent and must also be sufficient to produce a velocity for the two-year storm of two feet per second (fps). Compliance with this requirement must take into account the variation in channel flow due to distributed inflows to the channel. 
d.  Easments. Easements must be sized to allow for adequate access to the channels, including concrete ramps and drives ample enough for maintenance equipment. A minimum of five feet shall be provided from the back side of a retaining wall or uppermost section of concrete lining. Sufficient easements shall also be provided for future construction access.

    Neither water service connections nor water supply service can be provided for any premises where no water mains exist in the street, alley or road adjacent to the property for which such service connection and water supply service is sought, and no water service connection or water supply service shall be provided, except through connections made prior to March 20, 1962, over, through, across or along any private easement or right-of-way. 
(Code 1964, § 17-21) 
Sec. 102-101. - Main extensions. 
(a)  Where water service is desired and no main exists in an adjoining street, alley or road from which to make the connection, the applicant for water service shall make a written request to the city for service. The request shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee in the amount established by the city council and set forth in appendix C to this Code and a detailed preliminary map or plat prepared by a registered professional engineer showing the location of the proposed water line, the proposed usage requirements and surrounding conditions, to include roadways, street pavements, railroad crossings, utility easements, rock excavations, drainage and other physical obstructions to the main extension. 
(b)  The director of utilities shall review the application to ascertain compliance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations and requirements, with specific attention to the impact of the proposed extension on the city's existing water distribution system and production plant. Any application not in compliance with such regulations and requirements or creating a requirement for service in excess of the existing capacity of the water distribution system or production plant, shall be rejected. 
(c)  If the director of utilities ascertains that the application satisfies the requirements set forth in subsection (b) of this section or can be made to satisfy such requirements with modification, he shall recommend to the city council that the application shall be approved or approved subject to requisite modifications. If the application does not satisfy such requirements and cannot be made to satisfy such requirements, he shall recommend that it be disapproved. Required modifications may include any requirements for oversizing of the proposed extension main that the director of utilities deems appropriate in light of expected future usage of the main. The director of utilities shall then prepare a cost estimate for the proposed extension main and shall submit the estimate to the city council with his recommendations. The estimate shall include but not be limited to all procurement, engineering, administrative and construction costs associated with the main extension project. The city council shall approve or disapprove the application, with or without modifications, and the director of utilities will notify the applicant in writing of the council's action within 60 days of the date of application. The applicant shall also be advised of the estimated cost of the project, less the cost of any oversizing requirements imposed by the director of utilities in excess of the actual requirements of the applicant as determined by the city. 
(d)  Within 30 days of receipt from the director of utilities of the notice of approval, approval with modification or disapproval, the applicant shall deposit with the city a cash sum in the full amount of the cost estimate of the project, less the cost of any oversizing requirements imposed by the director of utilities in excess of the actual requirements of applicant as determined by the city. Within 90 days from the date of receipt of the deposit, the city shall commence work on the main extension and use every reasonable effort to complete the extension in a timely manner. 
(e)  The director of utilities shall calculate the per extension line front foot cost of the main extension. The cost of the main extension will be prorated to property owners benefiting from the extension on a per extension line front foot basis. The per extension line front foot cost will be applied to the extension line front footage of the lot to which service is desired and shall be due at the time connection is made in addition to any other service or connection charges required by the city. These prorated charges shall be refunded to the original applicant by the city as they are received. The total aggregate amount to be repaid to the applicant shall never exceed the total amount paid by the applicant to the city less the applicant's per extension line front foot pro rata share of the total project cost. After refund of the sum to the applicant or after five years from the date of the original deposit, whichever shall occur first, all or any portion of the deposit remaining unrefunded to the applicant shall be conclusively deemed to have become the property of the city as partial compensation for the cost of operating and maintaining the extension line and the depreciation thereof. If the city shall, at any time, lawfully discontinue any utility service to the applicant because of failure to pay any utility service charge or fee, all right to any further repayment shall immediately terminate. If the main is further extended beyond the point covered by the applicant's deposit and no additional deposit is made by the applicant, no refund shall be made on account of service connections on such extension of the main beyond the present extension. No refund will be made for any consumer connected after five years from the date of original deposit. The right to any such refund will terminate upon assignment or sale of the property first serviced in the original application. 
(f)  Absolute legal and equitable title to the main extension, wherever laid, and to all property installed by the city to provide utility service shall remain vested in the city, its successors and assigns, and the city shall at all times exercise all rights of ownership and control over the main extension and property use for all purposes in its Charter or as allowed by law, and make such extensions thereof and connections therewith as the city deems appropriate.

Sec. 102-213. - Compliance with division required. 
    Any person seeking approval to discharge industrial wastewater into the POTW within the corporate limits of the city or within its jurisdiction shall be required to comply with this division before such approval may be granted. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-214. - Scope. 
    This division sets forth uniform requirements to be met by all persons discharging nondomestic wastewater to the POTW. This division is written to enable the POTW to comply with and enforce all applicable state and federal laws pertaining to water quality control. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-215. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this division are to: 
(1)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW in such quantities or qualities that would cause interference or interfere with the ability of the POTW to use or dispose of municipal sludge. 
(2)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the system. 
(3)  Improve the opportunity for reclaiming and recycling wastewater and sludge generated by the POTW. 
(4)  Ensure quality of sludge to allow its use and disposal in compliance with statutes and regulations. 
(5)  Ensure that there is an equitable distribution of the operation, maintenance and capital related costs of the POTW across user classes.

(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 2011-30, § 2, 6-7-11) 
Sec. 102-216. - Jurisdiction. 
    This division shall be given full force and effect inside the corporate limits of the city and within those unincorporated areas located outside of the corporate limits of the city but within the designated regional wastewater system boundary. Additionally, this division shall apply to those entities being served by the POTW which have entered into wastewater permits and/or wastewater service contracts with the city. By operation of law, permit conditions, contract or intermunicipal agreement, nondomestic wastewater dischargers within unincorporated areas and incorporated areas are obligated to abide by this division. Except as otherwise provided, the control authority shall be responsible for the implementation, administration and enforcement of this division. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-217. - Basic fees. 
(a)  It is the purpose of this division to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the POTW for the implementation and continued operation of the program established in this division. 
(b)  The fees will consist of two basic charges. These include a user fee required of all industrial users and a sampling fee to be levied at the time of sampling conducted by the control authority to recover the costs of sample analysis. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-218. - Industrial waste surcharge. 
(a)  Industrial users that discharge wastewaters which exhibit none of the characteristics of prohibited wastes as defined in this division, other than excessive COD, i.e., in excess of 300 mg/l, shall be required to pretreat the wastewater to meet the requirements of this division. 
(b)  The industrial user shall file an industrial wastewater connection survey with the city providing for a surcharge over and above published water and wastewater rates. The basis for surcharge on wastewater from industrial users is a capital and operating cost as approved by the city council, per mg/l per month for the COD. Surcharge sampling by the control authority will normally be scheduled no more frequently than once per year. Once wastewater pollutant concentrations are established, the surcharge rate established by the analysis will be computed each month until subsequent sampling establishes the basis for an alternate surcharge rate. An industrial user may request additional sampling to demonstrate changed conditions in the strength of the wastewater no sooner than 30 days from the establishment of the surcharge. The surcharge will not be adjusted for 90 days from the time of the request for resampling to allow the control authority to be able to verify a significant change in the strength of the wastewater. A sample/analysis charge will be applied by the control authority consistent with the contractor laboratory service charge then in effect. These rates shall continue until changed by action of the city council. The surcharge shall be calculated for billing purposes with the following formula: 
S.C. = V[O.X(COD - 300)] 
Where: 
S.C. = Surcharge in dollars 
COD = Chemical oxygen demand, as defined in this division V = Monthly volume of water purchased in million gallons X = Rate as identified in appendix C 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-219. - Billing. 
    Surcharges for the discharge of wastewater by industrial users provided for in this division shall be included in the monthly utility bill and shall be paid monthly in accordance with the existing practices. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-220. - Failure to pay bills and repeated discharge of prohibited waste. 
    Failure to pay monthly bills for wastewater service when due or failure to pay the established wastewater surcharge for wastewater when due or repeated discharge of prohibited waste to the wastewater system shall be sufficient cause to disconnect any and all utilities. The same penalties and charges for failure to pay the bill for water and wastewater service when due shall be applicable in like manner for failure to pay the established surcharge for discharges of wastewater from industrial users to the City of Seguin as established in this division. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-221. - Pretreatment standards. 
    There are three types of pretreatment standards: prohibited discharge standards, including general, specific, and dilution prohibitions; national categorical standards; and local limits. The standards in this subsection shall apply to each user, as applicable. Users in an industrial manufacturing category specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, Subchapter N, "EPA Effluent Guidelines and Standards", shall be subject to prohibited discharge standards, national categorical standards, and local limits. Other users shall be subject to prohibited discharge standards and local limits. Where these standards overlap, the most stringent standards shall apply to the user. These standards may apply to individual nondomestic discharges before they are commingled as determined by the control authority. 
(a)  Prohibited discharge standards. The prohibitions listed at subsections (1) and (2) below apply to all users of the POTW whether or not the user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements: 
(1)  General prohibitions. No user shall indirectly contribute or cause to be contributed any pollutant or wastewater which will cause pass through or interference with the operation or performance of the POTW. 
(2)  Specific prohibitions. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
a.  Any pollutants which because of their nature or quantity are or may be sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other pollutants, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. This prohibition includes, without limitation, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system or at any other point in the system, be more than five percent or any single reading be over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include but are not limited to gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other substances which the city, state or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard to the system. 
b.  Solid or viscous substances in such quantities and qualities which will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to, grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshing, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing wastes. 
c.  Any wastewater having a pH less than 6.0 or greater than 9.0 or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing corrosive damage to structures, or equipment or hazard to personnel of the POTW. 
d.  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters at the effluent end of the POTW or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant to section 307(a) of the Act. 
e.  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to physically prevent reasonably safe and tolerable human and mechanical entry into the sewers for inspection, maintenance and repair purposes. 
f.  Any substance which may cause the POTWs effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for normal landfill disposal, land application reclamation or reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process where the POTW is pursuing a reuse and reclamation program. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or state criteria applicable to sludge management and disposal methods being used. 
g.  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its TPDES or state disposal system permit or the receiving water effluent quality standards. 
h.  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as but not limited to dye wastes, vegetable tanning solutions and whole blood. 
i.  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW treatment plant which exceeds 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Wastewater entering the regional collection system cannot exceed 65.5 degrees Celsius (150 degrees Fahrenheit) unless the quantity of heated discharge is of such volume that the total wastewater temperature at the nearest downstream manhole does not exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). 
j.  Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD or COD) released at a flow rate or pollutant concentration which will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or quantities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than five times the average daily concentration, quantities or flow during normal operation. 
k.  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits as permitted by the most current federal or state regulations or as established by the control authority in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
l.  Any wastewater containing petroleum, oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in such quantities or qualities that will cause interference or pass through in the POTW. Except in quantities or concentrations or with provisions as stipulated in this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to discharge wastewater to the POTW containing free or emulsified oil and grease exceeding on analysis a maximum of 100 parts per million (1,667 pounds per million gallons) of either or both or combinations of free or emulsified oil or grease or substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 degrees Celsius) and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius). 
m.  Any wastewater containing pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in quantities or qualities that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
n.  Any wastewater classified by EPA (at 40 CFR Part 261) or by the TCEQ (at 30 TAC Ch. 335) as a hazardous waste, without prior written approval of the control authority. 
o.  Any wastewater which creates a public nuisance. When the control authority determines that a user is indirectly discharging to the POTW any of the substances enumerated in this subsection in such quantities or concentrations so as to interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW, the wastewater treatment plant superintendent shall (i) advise the user of the impact of the indirect discharge on the POTW and (ii) develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the interference with the POTW. The control authority may also undertake action pursuant to section 102-230 of this division. Any hazardous materials discharge from any industrial user shall be limited to a maximum concentration based on the reportable quantity in pounds divided by 4,000,000 gallons per day. Hazardous materials shall be those included in table 117.3, 40 CFR 117, as may be amended from time to time. Five categories which list the code letters X, A, B, C, D are associated with reportable quantities of hazardous materials of one, ten, 100, 1,000 and 5,000 pounds, respectively. Allowable maximum concentrations are: 
X - 0.03 mg/l 
A - 0.30 mg/l 
B - 3.0 mg/l 
C - 30 mg/l 
D - 150 mg/l 
These concentrations apply unless a specific concentration is stated in this section. 
p.  Stormwater discharges are prohibited. 
q.  Any trucked or hauled waste except at discharge points designated by the POTW according to 40 CFR §403.5(b)(8). 
(3)  Dilution prohibition. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, unpolluted water, surface water or stormwater or in any other way attempt to dilute either a direct or indirect discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the specific pollutant limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards or in any other specific pollutant limitations promulgated by the city or state and incorporated in this division. 
(4)  Affirmative defenses. A user shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against it alleging a violation of the general prohibitions established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the specific prohibitions in paragraphs (a)(2)a, h, j, l and m of this section, where the user can demonstrate that: 
a.  It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference; and 
b.  1.  A local limit designed to prevent pass through and/or interference, as the case may be, was developed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for each pollutant in the user's discharge that caused pass through or interference, and the user was in compliance with each such local limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or 
2.  If a local limit designed to prevent pass through and/or interference, as the case may be, has not been developed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for the pollutant(s) that caused the pass through or interference, the user's discharge directly prior to and during the pass through or interference did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance with the POTWs TPDES permit requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal. 
(5)  Act of God defense. According to Texas Water Code, Section 7.251, an event that would otherwise be a violation of this division or a wastewater discharge permit is not a violation if it is caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe. 
(b)  National categorical pretreatment standards. National Categorical Standards apply to specific industrial subcategories under 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, "Effluent Guidelines and Standards". A user that falls into one of these subcategories shall be subject to the pretreatment standards applicable to that subcategory and is classified as a categorical user. 
(1)  Effect of categorical pretreatment standards. After the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standard for a particular industrial category or subcategory and upon expiration of any compliance period, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this division for sources in that category or subcategory, shall supersede and replace the limitations imposed under this division for that particular industrial category or subcategory. Federal categorical pretreatment standards that are more stringent than limitations imposed under this division for sources in a particular industrial category or subcategory and are already in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, shall also supersede and replace the limitations imposed under this division as they apply to the particular industrial category or subcategory so regulated. The control authority shall notify all affected users of the modified applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. 
(2)  Removal credits. The control authority may, at its discretion and subject to the conditions of 40 CFR 403.7, grant removal credits to an industrial user to which national categorical pretreatment standards apply. The control authority may grant removal credits to reflect removal by the POTW of pollutants specified in the national categorical pretreatment standard(s) to the extent equal to or, at its discretion, less than the POTWs consistent removal rate. For purposes of this section, consistent removal means the averageof the lowest 50 percent of the removal measured according to 40 CFR 403.7(b)(2). The control authority may only calculate revised discharge limits for an industrial user if the requirements of 40 CFR 403.7 are met and the control authority applies for and receives authorization from the approval authority to grant the removal credits. 
(c)  Local limits. Local limits are applicable to all users. Local limits are designed to ensure compliance with the general and specific provisions set out above. 
(1)  Limits. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the pollutant limits that are identified in appendix D. These limits are based on either flow proportional or time-proportional composite samples (mg/l). 
(2)  Discharge specific local limits. The control authority reserves the right to establish more stringent specific pollutant limitations or narrative requirements on discharges from significant industrial users to the POTW if deemed reasonably necessary by the control authority to protect the POTW or its operations or to cure or prevent an effluent quality problem in treated wastewater or resulting sludges. 
(3)  Mass-based local limits. On a permit-specific basis, a permittee may apply to the control authority and the control authority may issue a permit for a mass based permit under the following conditions: 
a.  The requested discharge does not exceed one percent of the average daily flow currently received at the wastewater treatment plant that would receive the wastewater discharge. 
b.  The mass of any regulated pollutant discharged in any month does not exceed 50 percent of the monthly cumulative mass of the pollutant if that pollutant were discharged at the maximum allowable daily composite rate at the one-percent flow rate specified in subsection (c)(3)a. of this section. 
c.  The permittee will pay for quarterly laboratory analysis by the control authority for all pollutant parameters specified in the user's individual permit to document compliance. 
d.  Intermittent discharges will be distributed over a minimum of an eight-hour period to minimize shock loading of the POTW. 
(4)  Refer to the attached "appendix D" for the adopted local limits. 
(5)  The control authority reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this ordinance. 
(6)  The control authority may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of subsection 102-221(a) of this division. Such BMPs shall be considered local limits and pretreatment standards for the purposes of 40 CFR Part 403 and Section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 2011-30, § 3, 6-7-11) 
Sec. 102-222. - Admission into POTW. 
(a)  Approval required. All nondomestic sources shall submit basic information to the control authority on a form provided for that purpose by the control authority. Review and written approval by the control authority shall be obtained prior to the discharge into the POTW by any nondomestic sources. 
(b)  Pretreatment required. If the control authority determines, based on the information submitted in subsection (a), that pretreatment is necessary to modify or eliminate wastes that are harmful to the structures of the POTW or that could cause interference or pass through, the person shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment or processing facilities as may be determined necessary to render his wastes acceptable for admission to the POTW. Design calculations, plans, specifications and other pertinent information relating to proposed industrial waste pretreatment or processing facilities shall be submitted for review, written acceptance or disapproval by the control authority prior to start of construction, if the effluent from such facilities is to be discharged to the POTW. The user shall not connect to the POTW without prior approval by the control authority. 
(c)  Permit required. If the control authority determines, based on the information submitted in subsection (a), that a permit is necessary to ensure compliance with this division, the user shall obtain a permit prior to discharge into the POTW. The user shall comply with the provisions of section 102-223, relating to industrial wastewater discharge permit. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-223. - Industrial wastewater discharge permit. 
(a)  Required. It shall be unlawful for a significant industrial user, or other user so required by the control authority to discharge any industrial wastewater into the POTW without first applying for and receiving a permit. This shall apply except when the control authority or this division specifically authorizes discharge in full accordance with other sections of this division. In any event, the POTW may deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants to the POTW by industrial users where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate its TPDES permit. 
(b)  Application. Users who are required to obtain an industrial wastewater discharge permit shall complete and file an application with the control authority on a form prepared by the control authority. The information requested may include the following: 
(1)  Name, address and location. 
(2)  SIC number according to the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, Bureau of the Budget, as amended. 
(3)  The nature and concentration of any pollutants in the discharge which are limited by the city, state or federal pretreatment standard, as determined by a registered professional engineer; sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the EPA pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR 136, as amended and results shall be included in the application. 
(4)  Time and duration of contribution. 
(5)  Average daily and peak wastewater flow rates, including daily, monthly and seasonal variations, if any. 
(6)  Site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans and details to show all sewers, wastewater connections and appurtenances by the size, location and elevation.

(12)  All applications must contain the following certification statement required by 40 CFR 403.6(a) (2)(ii) and the signature of an authorized representative of the user. 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction of supervision in accordance with the system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(c)  Existing users. Significant industrial users or other users required to be permitted with existing nondomestic discharges shall prepare and submit a permit application within 90 days from the date of final approval of this division by TCEQ. 
(d)  New users. New significant industrial users or other users required to be permitted shall submit a permit application at least 90 days prior to the date the significant industrial user intends to begin the discharge. A permit must be obtained prior to discharging to the POTW. 
(e)  Modifications. Upon the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, the industrial wastewater discharge permit of users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with such standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user becomes subject to an applicable categorical pretreatment standard and has not previously submitted an application for an industrial wastewater discharge permit as required by subsection (b) of this section, the user shall apply for an industrial wastewater discharge permit within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable categorical pretreatment standard but shall also comply with such standard within the time frame prescribed by such standard, regardless of the local permit issuance schedule. In addition, the user with an existing industrial wastewater discharge permit shall submit to the control authority within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard the information required by subsection (b) of this section. The control authority reserves the right to modify existing permits when necessary to protect the health and safety interests of the users of the regional system. 
(f)  Conditions. Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly subject to all sections of this division and all other applicable state and federal regulations, as well as the user charges and fees established by the control authority or city council. At a minimum permits shall contain the following conditions: effluent limits, including best management practices, based on applicable pretreatment standards, categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and state and local law; statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements; self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification and recordkeeping, statement of duration and statement of non-transferability. In addition, permits shall contain the following requirements, if applicable: 
(1)  The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the wastewater to be discharged to a regional system sewer.

(g)  Duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period of less than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The terms and conditions of the permit are subject to modification by the city during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in this division are modified or other just cause exists that warrants modification. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit prior to the effective date of the proposed change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(h)  Renewal. A permit may be renewed by submitting an application for permit renewal in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. An application shall be submitted by a permittee at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the existing permit. The control authority may modify the renewed permit as necessary to prevent interference and pass through and comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations. 
(i)  Transfer. Industrial wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation at a specific location. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises or a new or changed operation without the prior approval of the control authority. The City of Seguin will provide copies of the Ordinances 01-51, 06-92, 06-93 upon application for the permit and a copy of the permit upon permit issuance. 
(j)  Appeals. Once the control authority issues a final permit to the industrial user, the industrial user has the right to appeal. The appeal must be made within 30 days of the issuance of the final permit. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 09-45, § 1, 7-21-09; Ord. No. 2011-30, § 4, 6-7-11) 
Sec. 102-224. - Pretreatment facilities. 
    Under this division, users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this division and to achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within compliance schedule requirements as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment to comply with local limits and established prohibitions. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to quality standards required by the control authority shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and an outline of the pretreatment facility operating procedures shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer and submitted to the control authority for review. All plans shall be approved by the control authority before construction of the facility. The user shall ensure that construction of the treatment facility is accomplished within the time period specified by the city. A schedule for completion with periodic progress reports may be required. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the control authority under this division. 
    Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or their method of operation shall be reported to and be reviewed for approval by the control authority prior to the user's initiation of the changes. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards and documentation associated with best management practices shall be made available to the control authority, the EPA or the state upon request and shall be retained by the user for a minimum of three years or until any ongoing litigation involving the pretreating user and related to compliance with this division has been resolved. 
(a)  Construction. Pretreatment facilities shall be constructed so as to provide the following: 
(1)  Prevention of prohibited discharges from entering a sewer; 
(2)  Control of the quantities and rates of discharge of nondomestic sewage into a sewer; and 
(3)  An accessible entry so that any authorized employee of the city may readily and safely inspect and monitor the nondomestic discharges. 
(b)  Maintenance. Pretreatment facilities shall be maintained in satisfactory and effective operation by the user at the user's expense. Operation and maintenance records shall be maintained by the user as specified in the user's discharge permit. 
(c)  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. Users discharging nondomestic wastewater into the POTW shall provide protection from the accidental discharge of prohibited wastes. While the control authority may choose how frequently to assess slug related concerns, at a minimum, the control authority shall evaluate at least once whether each significant industrial user requires an accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control slug discharges. This evaluation must occur within one year of the effective date of Ordinance No. 2011-30 for SIUs identified as significant (yet never evaluated for the need for a slug control plan) prior to the effective date of this ordinance [Ord. No. 2011-30]. SIUs identified as significant after the effective date of this ordinance [Ord. No. 2011-30] must be evaluated for the need for a slug control plan within one year of being identified as significant. The control authority shall maintain records of these evaluation activities, and results shall be made available to the TCEQ or EPA upon request. The control authority may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the control authority may develop such a plan for any user. Each plan shall include the following as a minimum: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the control authority of any accidental or slug discharge, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up notification within five days, as required by section 102-226 of this division. 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, measures and equipment for emergency response and any other procedures deemed necessary to prevent accidental/slug discharges from entering the POTW. 
(d)  Notification of significant facility change. EPA also adds a requirement that SIUs must notify the City of Seguin immediately of any changes at their facilities not already addressed in their slug control plan or other slug control requirements, which may affect the potential for a slug discharge. This requirement is especially relevant in the case of those users for which the City of Seguin has determined, from some prior assessment, that a slug control plan or other action is unnecessary. However, EPA emphasizes that this requirement affects all SIUs, even those that already have slug control plans or other measures in place. See 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vi). This provision places an affirmative duty on such Users to provide the City of Seguin with updated information on the potential slug risks that are posed by industrial process changes. This provision is consistent with, but differs from the existing notification of changed discharge in 40 CFR 403.12(j), which focuses on advance notice of change in the volume or character of pollutants in the discharge itself. 
(e)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the control authority may require a user to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of the ordinance. 
(2)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when deemed necessary by the control authority for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil or sand. Such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the control authority and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense. 
(3)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 2011-30, § 5, 6-7-11) 
Sec. 102-225. - Inspection, surveillance, and monitoring. 
(a)  Minimum monitoring requirements. Significant industrial users shall be required to self-monitor to meet, at a minimum, the requirements of the general pretreatment regulations. 
(b)  Sampling and analysis. 
(1)  Significant industrial users shall meet the requirements of the general pretreatment regulations for sampling and analysis. Other users shall meet the requirements for sampling and analysis as stated herein or in the user's permit or service agreement. 
(2)  For all users, containers, preservation techniques, and holding times for samples shall comply with methods and procedures found at Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 136. 
(3)  For all users, sample analysis shall be in accordance with approved test procedures. The control authority, at his discretion, may specify which approved test procedure shall be used as listed in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 136. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include sampling and analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the control authority. 
(4)  Type of samples (grab or composite) and flow measurement shall be consistent with the type of discharge and parameters being regulated and shall be specified by the control authority in the permit. 
(5)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(c)  Compliance point. 
(1)  A user shall provide a compliance point for the purpose of sampling and flow measurement. The location and design of the compliance point shall be approved by the control authority. The compliance point shall be placed so that nondomestic sewage can be sampled and measured prior to any commingling with domestic sewage or nonprocess flows. Written approval of exceptions to this requirement shall be obtained by a user from the control authority. It is recommended that the compliance point for sampling and flow measurement be at the same location. Flow shall be determined by water supply meter measurements. If another source of raw water is used, the user shall install a flow measurement device as approved by the control authority. 
(2)  The control authority may require monitoring facilities that allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the discharge point and internal drainage systems located on private property. These facilities shall be provided by the user and operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not create a public safety hazard or be obstructed by structures, landscaping or parked vehicles, as approved by the control authority. 
(3)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to safely allow for inspection personnel to position sampling equipment and prepare field samples for analysis. 
(4)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with city requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. 
(d)  Entry, inspection and sampling. The control authority shall conduct inspection and sampling of each significant industrial user at least once per year. The control authority or his duly authorized representative, federal and state officials, upon presentation of credentials and other documentation as may be required by law, shall be permitted to gain access to such properties as may be necessary for the purpose of inspection, observation, sampling, setup and use of monitoring equipment, and inspection and copying of records having a direct bearing on the discharges of nondomestic sewage. Unreasonable delays in allowing access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
(e)  Use of contractors. The control authority may select an independent contractor to conduct the independent monitoring by the city. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 2011-30, § 6, 6-7-11) 
Sec. 102-226. - Notification requirements applicable to all users. 
(a)  Notification of changed discharge. All industrial users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). Any SIUs must notify the City of Seguin/Control Authority immediately of any changes at their facilities, not already addressed in their slug control plan or other slug control requirements, which may affect the potential for a slug discharge. This requirement is especially relevant in the case of those users for which the City of Seguin/Control Authority has determined, from some prior assessment, that a slug control plan or other action is unnecessary. However, this requirement affects all SIUs, even those that already have slug control plans or other measures in place. See 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vi). This provision places an affirmative duty on such Users to provide the City of Seguin/Control Authority with updated information on the potential slug risks that are posed by industrial process changes. This provision is consistent with, but differs from the existing notification of changed discharge in 40 CFR 403.12Q), which focuses on advance notice of change in the volume or character of pollutants in the discharge itself. 
(b)  Notification to control authority. Notification to the control authority is required as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours of the following events: 
(1)  A condition or event that would cause pass-through of or interference with the POTW, including slug loadings as defined in this division. 
(2)  Permit noncompliance. 
(3)  Bypasses and upsets. 
(4)  A change in pretreatment processes. 
(5)  A change in monitoring facilities such as location and type of equipment. 
(6)  Discharges of hazardous waste as defined in 40 C.F.R. Part 261. 
(7)  Discharges containing radioactive materials. 
(8)  Other appropriate conditions or events as necessary to ensure compliance with any federal, state or local pretreatment regulations or other requirements. 
(c)  Notification of significant facility change. EPA also adds a requirement that SLUs must notify the City of Seguin immediately of any changes at their facilities, not already addressed in their slug control plan or other slug control requirements, which may affect the potential for a slug discharge. This requirement is especially relevant in the case of those users for which the City of Seguin has determined, from some prior assessment, that a slug control plan or other action is unnecessary. However, EPA emphasizes that this requirement affects all SLUs, even those that already have slug control plans or other measures in place. See 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vi). This provision places an affirmative duty on such Users to provide the City of Seguin with updated information on the potential slug risks that are posed by industrial process changes. This provision is consistent with, but differs from the existing notification of changed discharge in 40 CFR 403.12(j), which Focuses on advance notice of change in the volume or character of pollutants in the discharge itself. 
(d)  Reports of additional samples taken. If a user subject to pretreatment requirements monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control authority, using approved test procedures, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the periodic reports. 
(e)  Repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. If the repeat analysis falls within the normal monthly sampling timeframe the results may be used in lieu of that month's sample requirements. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the control authority performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the control authority performs sampling at the user's facility between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the control authority receives the results of this sampling, or if the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. If the control authority performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the control authority will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. 
(f)  Sample collection and monitoring requirements. 
(1)  All sampling techniques and pollutant analyses used for compilation of data required to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge application or report required by any pretreatment requirement shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 136 unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. 
(2)  Except as indicated in subsection (3) and (4) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized in writing by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may only be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(3)  Samples for oil and grease, residual chlorine, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(4)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsection 102-227(a) and (c) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. Where there has been a change to existing IUs, historic data that does not represent the current discharge cannot be able to be used to justify a lower minimum of grab samples. For the reports required by subsection 102-227(d) (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(g)  Additional reports. The control authority has the right to request any additional reports from a user that are necessary to assess and assure compliance with the pretreatment requirements. 
(h)  Recordkeeping. 
(1)  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division, including documentation associated with best management practices, and additional records obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. 
(2)  Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of the sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the sample; dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of the analyses. 
(3)  Records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the control authority, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the control authority. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 2011-30, § 7, 6-7-11) 
Sec. 102-227. - Reporting requirements applicable to categorical users and significant industrial users. 
(a)  Baseline report applicable to categorical users. Categorical users shall submit baseline reports in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(b). 
(1)  Within either 180 days after either the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2) below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2) below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(2)  Users described above shall submit the information required by 40 CFR 403.12(b), including the following: 
a.  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner. 
b.  Environmental permits. A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) earned out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula. 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. The user shall identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the control authority, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfides and total volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composites must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample. Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. Sampling and analysis shall be collected and analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in 40 CFR 136. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the control authority or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. The report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
f.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the national categorical pretreatment standards, the user should include the shortest schedule by which the user can provide such additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance. 
g.  Certification and signature. Baseline monitoring reports must include the certification set out in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the certification described at 40 CFR 403.12(b)(6). Baseline monitoring reports must be signed in accordance with signatory requirements at 40 CFR 403.12(1). 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports applicable to categorical users. 
(1)  Should additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance be required to meet pretreatment standards, a compliance schedule will be issued. The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment facilities required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment requirements. 
(2)  No increment shall exceed nine months. 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the control authority no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance. This report shall include as a minimum, whether or not the user complied with the progress increments. If the user failed to meet any compliance dates, the progress report shall state the day on which the user expects to comply, the reasons for any delays, and steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline applicable to categorical users. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the control authority a report containing the information described in subsection (a)(2) of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. This compliance report must be certified in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(b)(6) and must contain the certification at subsection 102-227(e)(1) of this division. Categorical users shall submit reports in accordance with the general pretreatment regulations on compliance schedule progress, compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, and continued compliance with categorical pretreatment standards. The compliance report must be signed in accordance with signatory requirements at 40 CFR 403.12(1). 
(d)  Periodic reports on continued compliance applicable to categorical users and significant industrial users. 
(1)  All categorical users and other significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the control authority but in all cases at least once every six months, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants and the estimated or measured daily maximum and average flows of the discharges to which any pretreatment requirements are applicable. All periodic reports must be based on sampling and analysis conducted during the period covered by the report and must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (e)(1) of this section [see 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2) and 40 CFR 403.12(1)]. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(2)  The control authority may require all other users and/or persons discharging nondomestic wastewater into the POTW to submit appropriate reports concerning the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge. 
(3)  Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(e)  Certification statements. 
(1)  The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with section 102-223; users submitting baseline monitoring reports under paragraph (a) of this section [see 40 CFR 403.12(1)]; users submitting reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines under paragraph (c) of this section [see 40 CFR 403.12(d)]; and users submitting periodic compliance reports required by paragraph (d) of this section [see 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h)]. The following certification statement must be signed by an authorized representative as defined in subsection 102-211(4) of this division: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction of supervision in accordance with the system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 2011-30, § 8, 6-7-11; Ord. No. 2014-67, § 1, 11-4-14 ) 
Sec. 102-228. - Confidential information. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b) and (c), any information submitted to the control authority may be claimed as confidential by the submitter. Any such claim must be asserted at the time of submission by stamping the words "confidential business information" on each page containing such information. If no claim is made at the time of submission, the control authority may make the information available to the public without further notice. If a claim is asserted, the information will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR Part 2. 
(b)  Information and data containing effluent data submitted to the control authority shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(c)  Any information submitted to the control authority, regardless of whether a claim of confidentiality is asserted, may be made available by the control authority to TCEQ or EPA. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 2011-30, § 9, 6-7-11) 
Sec. 102-229. - Dangerous discharges. 
(a)  The control authority may unilaterally order the suspension of water and wastewater service to any user in order to prevent or eliminate an indirect discharge which could cause imminent, serious endangerment to the health or safety of any person, significant damage to the environment, significant interference with the POTW or violations of the city's TPDES permit conditions. 
(b)  Concurrent with ordering such a suspension, the control authority shall issue a brief written report containing information and investigative data used in ordering the suspension of service. A copy of this report will be expeditiously forwarded to the affected user and to the city manager. 
(c)  The control authority shall order reinstatement of any discontinued water and wastewater service upon presentation by the user of written registered professional engineering proof or other written proof acceptable to the control authority that the dangerous discharge has been eliminated and that recurrence is not possible. 
(d)  Cost incurred by the city, the control authority or its agents in detecting, investigating, monitoring, measuring and eliminating the dangerous discharge, along with any disconnect and reconnect fees, shall be reimbursed to the city by the user responsible for the dangerous discharge. Any property damages to the POTW or its appurtenant structures resulting from the dangerous discharge shall also be borne by the user responsible for the dangerous discharge. 
(e)  Because of the urgent public need to immediately abate such dangerous discharges, the affected user is not afforded an administrative review hearing before the city manager or city council prior to the control authority ordering suspension of water and wastewater service. Subsequent to an order to suspend service, the control authority shall issue a notice of alleged violation to the affected user in accordance with section 102-230. This action will afford the affected user an opportunity for administrative procedural review of an alleged violation of this division and an industrial wastewater discharge permit. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 2011-30, § 10, 6-7-11) 
Sec. 102-230. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The control authority, its authorized representatives, and authorized representatives of state and federal government, upon presentation of credentials and other documentation as may be required by law, shall be permitted to enter the premises of any industrial user in which a discharge source or treatment system is located or in which records are required to be kept as may be necessary to carry out inspections, observations, sampling set up and use of monitoring equipment and inspection and copying of records having a direct bearing on the discharge of pollutants from any nondomestic source. Unreasonable delays in allowing authorized persons to have access to the user's premises as described above shall be a violation of this division. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the control authority has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City of Seguin designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the control authority may seek issuance of a search warrant from the municipal courts of the City of Seguin. 
(c)  Notice of violation. The control authority may serve a user that is found noncompliant with the pretreatment requirements with a notice stating the nature of the noncompliance. Any violation of pretreatment standards incurs immediate liability. Each day of violation constitutes a separate noncompliance. Within ten days after the date of receipt of this notice, a user shall submit a written response to the control authority with an explanation of the noncompliance, what steps are currently being taken to prevent the noncompliance, and a plan for the correction and continued prevention of the noncompliance. Submission of this response in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(d)  Consent order. The control authority may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. 
(e)  Show cause order; hearing. The control authority may order a user which has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement action issued, or any other pretreatment requirement, to appear before the city manager or his duly authorized representative and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served by hand or certified mail at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Compliance order; compliance schedules. 
(1)  Applicability. If a user cannot comply with the pretreatment standards in section 102-221 or any other pretreatment requirement, the control authority may provide a compliance order containing a schedule for achieving compliance. 
(2)  Allowable time for compliance. The compliance schedule shall be the shortest time in which the user is able to provide pretreatment facilities or changes in operation and maintenance that will achieve compliance. If a user is given a compliance schedule for national categorical standards, the completion date of this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable national categorical standard and shall be in accordance with the general pretreatment requirements. A user shall not continue discharging in noncompliance of the pretreatment requirements beyond the time limit provided in the compliance schedule. 
(3)  Form of compliance schedule. Compliance schedules may be provided by the control authority by notice of noncompliance, enforcement order, or as part of the discharge permit. The control authority has the right to reopen a user's discharge permit in order to add a compliance schedule. Issuance of a compliance schedule does not prevent the control authority from taking additional enforcement actions, including assessment of fines, under this section. 
(g)  Cease and desist order. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued herein, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the control authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive actions as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(h)  Authority to disconnect service. 
(1)  Conditions for disconnection. The city shall have the right to disconnect a user's sewer service when a user's discharge reasonably appears to: 
a.  Damage sewer lines or POTW treatment processes; 
b.  Cause the POTW to be noncompliant with the conditions of its discharge permits; 
c.  Present an endangerment to the environment or which threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW; or 
d.  Present an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. 
(2)  Notification. In the case of an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the underall other conditions for disconnection, the control authority shall give written notice to a user before disconnection. Within ten days after receipt of notification of disconnection, the user must submit a written response to the control authority with an explanation of the cause of the problem and what measures have and will be taken to prevent any future occurrence. Submission of this response in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of disconnection. 
(3)  Reconnection of service. The user's sewer shall remain disconnected until such time that the user has demonstrated that the cause of this noncompliance has been eliminated. 
(4)  Liability. The city shall not be liable for any resulting damage to the user's property as a result of disconnection under the conditions for disconnection. 
(i)  Termination of permit. A user that violates any of the following conditions may be subject to permit termination: 
(1)  Failure to report a reasonable estimate of the volume and quality of its nondomestic sewage. 
(2)  Failure to notify the control authority of a change in process or operation which would significantly change the nature or increase the quantities of materials discharged to the POTW or that would cause the user to be noncompliant with its discharge permit requirements or the pretreatment requirements. 
(3)  Refusal of right of entry to the user's premises in accordance with this division. 
(4)  Intentional violation of permit conditions. 
(5)  Falsifying information. 
(6)  Failure to pay sewer charges or fines. 
(j)  Injunctive relief. The control authority may seek injunctive relief to restrain or compel actions of a user. 
(k)  Civil and criminal penalties. The control authority has the right to seek or assess civil or criminal penalties in the amount of up to $2,000.00 per day for each violation of the user's permit or any requirement of this division. 
(l)  Recovery of damages to city. 
(1)  Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage incurred by the city by reason of such violation. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter's fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit against the person found to have violated this article or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. 
(2)  The control authority is further authorized to prosecute and seek all criminal and civil remedies in the various courts as set forth in the Texas Water Code, Chapter 26, Water Quality Control, Subchapter D-Prohibition Against Pollution; Enforcement, Subchapter E-Authority of Local Government; and Subchapter F-Criminal Prosecution, for all violations of this article or violations of any conditions of a permit granted by the control authority. 
(m)  Legal actions. If any person discharges sewage, industrial waste or wastes into the city's wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this article, state requirements, federal pretreatment requirements, or any order of the city, the city attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(n)  Penalties; administrative fines. Any person who violates any provision of this article or any order or permit issued hereunder or who fails to comply with any provision hereof may be fined an administrative fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000.00, and each day that such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
(o)  Publication of industrial user or significant industrial users in significant noncompliance. The control authority shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction served by the POTW, a list of users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. For the purposes of this section, an industrial user or significant industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numerical pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) for the same pollutant parameter; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH). 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum or long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the control authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public); 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under paragraph (h)(1)d. of this section to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; 
(8)  Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a violation of best management practices, which the control authority determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. EPA has amended daily maximum or average limitations 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vii)(A) and (B) (now 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(viii)(A) and (B)) to apply to a broader range of violations such as other numeric limits, instantaneous limits, narrative limits, or operational standards, and amending 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vii)(C) (now 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(viii)(C)) to address other pretreatment standards and requirements.

Sec. 102-231. - Bypass. 
(a)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(b)  Severe property damage means: 
(1)  Substantial physical damage to property; 
(2)  Damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable; or 
(3)  Substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(c)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. 
(d)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(e)  A user shall submit oral notice to the control authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment requirements within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The control authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if proper oral notice has been given. 
(f)  Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(3)  The user submitted notices as stated herein. 
(g)  The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three conditions in paragraph (f) above. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-232. - Fraud and false statements prohibited. 
    It shall be a violation of this division to make any fraudulent or false statement to the control authority. The reports and other documents required to be submitted under this division shall be subject to the provisions of 18 USC 1001, as well as to sections 309(c)(4) and 309(c)(6) of the Act. 
(Ord. No. 09-11, § 1, 2-3-09) 
Sec. 102-233. - Protection from damage. 
    No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the POTW. Any person violating this section shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 00-21, adopted Feb. 28, 2000, repealed §§ 102-256-102-263, which were the substantive provisions of Ch. 102, Art. V, Water and Wastewater Impact Fees, and which derived from Ord. No. 90-17, adopted June 5, 1990. 

Secs. 102-256-102-274. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VI. - WATER CONSERVATION PLAN 

Sec. 102-275. - Protection of water source. 
    The protection of the city's water source, the Guadalupe River, is accomplished through governmental regulation and water conservation. Accidental, intentional and incidental pollution from cities, industry, agriculture and recreational activities are controlled by governmental regulation. The City of Seguin supports the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) financially through water quality assessment fees. These fees are used for the purpose of monitoring and testing the river water to detect, prevent and control any source of pollution or misuse in the river basin. The primary function of the city water treatment plant is to provide the public with a safe drinking water supply. This responsibility starts with ensuring our source of water is of the best quality possible and to protect our source of supply now and for the future. 
(Ord. No. 96-28, § 1, 4-2-96) 
Sec. 102-276. - Water quality. 
(a)  In no other industry do so many people depend on so few for so much. To guarantee that the public receives the best product and service, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), an agency of the State of Texas, sets and enforces strict guidelines and standards in water treatment processes. It requires all plant personnel active in the water treatment to be highly trained and certified. 
(b)  The city water treatment plant has always maintained these standards and has received a superior rating as a water treatment plant in the State of Texas. 
(c)  The TNRCC requires annual, quarterly, monthly and daily testing of water quality to ensure that the water being provided to the consumer meets all water quality standards. The majority of the water quality testing is performed in a state-certified laboratory while the daily routine testing is performed by qualified water plant personnel. 
(d)  All plant personnel at the treatment facility are required by the city and TNRCC to be licensed as certified operators. This certification is accomplished by attending classes provided by the Texas A & M Extension Service and passing an examination administered by the TNRCC. Competent, trained water plant operators are the key to good water quality. 
(Ord. No. 96-28, § 1, 4-2-96) 
Sec. 102-277. - Water treatment process. 
(a)  The city operates and maintains a water treatment facility in Max Starcke Park. The treatment facility is considered to be a full treatment process which is required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the TNRCC. The TNRCC inspects the treatment facility annually to ensure all treatment processes are in accordance with the recommended standards. 
(b)  The water treatment plant pumps water from the Guadalupe River to be processed through the treatment facility. As water is pumped from the river, a chlorine solution is injected at the discharge of the river pumps for the purpose of pre-chlorination. Pre-chlorination will kill bacteria, viruses, algae and other waterborne organisms before water enters any treatment unit. 
(c)  After pre-chlorination, the water enters the clarifiers, where the processes of flocculation and sedimentation occur. To achieve this process a chemical, aluminum sulfate, is added to the river water, which reacts with particulate matter such as silt. This reaction is called "flocculation." Flocculation is the formation of curd-like particles of chemical and mud as a result of a chemical reaction. The curd-like particles called "floc" are heavy and will settle to the bottom of the clarifiers, thus the process of sedimentation occurs. During this process a chemical, caustic soda, is added to adjust the pH of the water. This prevents corrosion of the pipes in the city's distribution system or plumbing fixtures in homes. The clear water, after the process of sedimentation, flows to dual media filters where all remaining silt and organisms are removed. After filtration, the sparkling clear water is post-chlorinated to ensure no bacterial organisms are present which would have been introduced during the treatment process and provide protection throughout the distribution system. This water is now safe for human consumption and is pumped to the citizens for their use. 
(Ord. No. 96-28, § 1, 4-2-96) 
Sec. 102-278. - Water storage and capacity. 
(a)  Storage reservoirs and tanks are a necessary part of the city water system. During periods of high consumption, the storage tanks provide water to meet peak demand use and emergency situations. The elevated storage tanks also provide adequate pressure uniformly across the city and allow the treatment plant to be operational at a consistent rate. 
(b)  The city maintains a reservoir which is part of the natural river channel behind the dam in Max Starcke Park. The city received authorization to maintain the reservoir in its 1914 Water Rights Permit by the TNRCC. The city can impound four hundred twenty-five (425) acre-feet of water (138,500,000 gallons) and divert this water through the treatment plant for municipal use. 
(c)  The water treatment plant has a rated capacity to purify eleven million six hundred thousand (11,600,000) gallons per day. The water that is purified is stored at the plant in a ground storage tank and clearwells. The combined capacity of the clearwell and ground storage at the treatment plant is three million three hundred thousand (3,300,000) gallons. This volume of water is held in storage at the plant to meet peak hour flow demand and emergency events. 
(d)  To meet the immediate needs of the public, elevated storage tanks are located throughout the system to maintain pressure and supply as demand dictates. The city has four (4) elevated storage tanks in the distribution system. A one-half million (500,000) gallon elevated tank is located on East Ireland Street to meet the needs of the central area of town. A one million (1,000,000) gallon elevated tank is located on West Kingsbury Street to service the west side of town and an additional one million (1,000,000) gallon elevated tank is located on Lucille Street to service the eastern portion of Seguin. To service the Industrial Park and the north side of Seguin, a one hundred fifty thousand (150,000) gallon elevated tank was provided. These four (4) elevated storage tanks have a total capacity of three million one hundred fifty thousand (3,150,000) gallons of readily available water. 
(e)  The total water storage capacity of the City of Seguin is six million ninety thousand (6,090,000) gallons.

(Ord. No. 96-28, § 1, 4-2-96) 
Sec. 102-279. - Permitted water. 
(a)  The City of Seguin holds a Certificate of Adjudication No. 18-3839, which authorizes the city to divert seven thousand (7,000) acre-feet of water per year from the run of the river flow of the Guadalupe River for municipal purposes. This certification of adjudication has an original priority date of 1914, giving the city a senior permit over later permit holders. The original 1914 Water Right Permit authorized the city to divert seven thousand (7,000) acre-feet of water at a rate of twelve (12) cubic feet per second (cfs) [or] five thousand three hundred eighty (5,380) gallons per minute (gpm). In 1988 the diversion rate was increased to twenty-three (23) cfs (10,316 gpm) to meet the projected increase in water use due to population increase. The twenty-three (23) cfs did not receive the same senior rights dated as the original twelve (12) cfs of June 24, 1914, but carries the date it was granted, October 25, 1988. 
(b)  These water right have been issued by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and are recognized by the State of Texas. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission will require the city to comply with all terms, conditions and provisions of the permit. In turn, the TNRCC will protect the city's water rights and the rights to divert water from the Guadalupe River by using its branch division, the South Texas Water Master, to enforce all water rights. The city recognizes that its run-of-river water right, regardless of the priority date, will not supply the city's needs during a repeat of the drought of record. 
(Ord. No. 96-28, § 1, 4-2-96) 
Sec. 102-280. - Alternate water supply. 
(a)  The city recognizes the need of a water supply that will be available at all times, even during droughts. In order to supply water to its citizens, the City of Seguin has developed an alternate supply of water in the event the water flow in the Guadalupe River becomes insufficient or ceases to meet pumping requirements for the city water system. 
(b)  The city has contracted with the Guadalupe Blanco River Authority (GBRA) for its commitment to supply Seguin with stored water from the Canyon Reservoir. The annual commitment from the water from Canyon Reservoir is for 3,000 acre-feet of water. This water will be delivered to the city upon request and be diverted from the river channel at a rate not to exceed 23 cfs. The water diverted by the water treatment plant is metered to assure all available contracted water is utilized. 
(Ord. No. 96-28, § 1, 4-2-96) 
Sec. 102-281. - Water Conservation Plan. 
(a)  Introduction. The City of Seguin is dedicated to conserving one of the world's greatest natural resources: Water. The city has 13,300 acre-feet of available water in its system for residential and industrial use, approximately one-third of which is used by the city each year. To reduce consumption of water by all customers, the city promotes water conservation through education and information, water conserving landscaping (xeriscape), leak detection and repair, universal metering, rate structure, recycling and reuse, retrofit programs, plumbing codes, and implementation and enforcement. 
(b)  Education and information. Water conservation will be promoted by informing water users about ways to save water inside homes and other buildings, in landscaping and lawn uses, and in recreational uses. The city maintains a list of suggested ways that water can be saved daily in the home; bathroom, kitchen, laundry room, appliances and plumbing equipment, and out-of-door usage. 
    Methods of informing the public shall include: 
(1)  Radio spots: 
a.  City personnel will provide radio spots on a weekly basis during peak demands. These radio spots will keep the citizens up to date on river conditions, total water used and encourage citizen support for conservation efforts. 
b.  Conservation tips will be announced on the radio. 
c.  The city will use a variety of radio spots, including ones developed successfully by other agencies. 
d.  The city will encourage citizen participation by asking them to do radio spots on their best water conservation tips. 
(2)  Newspaper: 
a.  Provide news releases on the water plant pumpage and storage conditions. 
b.  Provide articles and news releases on water conservation tips. 
(3)  Pamphlets: 
a.  Pamphlets are available to the public on water conservation in city hall, and will be made available at hardware stores and general merchandise stores. 
b.  When a customer applies for new service, conservation tips will be made available for their reference. 
c.  Utility bill messages and door hangers on conservation will be used periodically, as appropriate. 
d.  The city encourages water conservation during community events such as the Guadalupe County Fair, Earth Day and National Drinking Water Week. 
(4)  Governmental access cable channel, webpage and social media sites: 
a.  Provide daily news releases to keep citizens informed on conservation on the local access cable channel. 
b.  Provide articles on water conservation tips. 
c.  Provide current information on the City of Seguin webpage. 
d.  Provide current information and important notices through the city's social media sites. 
(c)  Water conserving landscaping. In order to reduce the demands placed on a water system by landscape watering, the city will encourage education and information on water conserving landscaping. 
(1)  The city encourages landscape architects to use adapted, low-water-using plants and grasses and efficient irrigation systems in preparing all site and facility plans. 
(2)  The city encourages licensed irrigation contractors to use drip irrigation systems when possible and to design irrigation systems with water conservation features, such as sprinklers that emit large drops rather than a fine mist and a sprinkler layout that accommodates prevailing wind direction. 
(3)  The city encourages commercial establishments to use drip irrigation for landscape watering when possible and to install only ornamental fountains that recycle and sue the minimum amount of water. 
(4)  The city encourages nurseries and local businesses to offer adapted, low-water-using plants and grasses and efficient landscape watering devices, such as drip irrigation systems. 
(5)  The city will provide water-conserving landscaping at a city facility or park to use as an example for the public. 
(d)  Leak detection and repair. The city currently has a leak-detection program which is maintained in the following manner: 
(1)  The city has invested in an automated meter reading water meter system to be able to monitor water use and to manage the system, including the detection of possible leaks. 
(2)  If the meter reading is abnormally high, a recheck is made to determine if there is a possible leak on the customer['s] service. 
(3)  Water/sewer maintenance department personnel are "on call" 24-hours a day and constantly monitor the water level in all water storage tanks. Operators can immediately recognize a major water main break. When this occurs, the water plant personnel notify the water/sewer maintenance department so that immediate repairs can begin. 
(4)  Water/sewer maintenance department personnel are on call 24-hours a day for repairs if needed. When a citizen suspects a water main break by observing water running down the street, they are encouraged to call the police department dispatcher so that the on-call personnel can be notified. 
(5)  Most distribution system leaks are detected early because of the ground condition due to water on the surface and the AMR meters. 
(e)  Universal metering. 
(1)  The City of Seguin accounts for water production and water loss by maintaining accurate master meters and a replacement program for distribution meters. 
(2)  Master meters used to record water plant production, purchase of wholesale water, and delivery of water to major industrial users are calibrated semi-annually. The accuracy of these meters is plus or minus two percent accuracy of the manufacturer's maximum flow. Qualified technicians are contracted to check calibration and provide documentation to the city. 
(3).  The AMR meters that are not working properly or have abnormally high or low readings are replaced. The city has in place a meter replacement program. 
(4)  The City of Seguin meters all customers in their water distribution system. Meters have been installed on all city and recreational complexes to accurately account for all water used. 
(f)  Rate structure. The city has a conservation-oriented water rate structure which was adopted May 1, 1985, This structure has continued through the present date. The city's rate structure encourages the wise use of water. This residential rate has been structured to discourage excessive water usage while assuring that the rates will not place an excessive burden on fixed-income residents. 
(g)  Recycling and reuse. 
(1)  The City of Seguin Water Treatment Plant generates wastewater during the treatment process. Wastewater comes from the backwash process of cleaning filter and sludge removal in clarification units. The wastewater from the Seguin Water Plant is stored in sludge basins and is then pumped to the Starcke Park Municipal Golf Course to irrigate the golf course. This reuse water is also pumped to both the City of Seguin softball and baseball complexes. During a wet season when the golf course and baseball fields do not need to irrigate the wastewater is recycled through the treatment process of the water plant. 
(2)  The City of Seguin has two wastewater treatment plants. The Walnut Branch Plant has a discharge greater than 2,000,000 gallons per day. A portion of the wastewater effluent is pumped to the Rio Nogales Power Plant as reuse water for use in generating electric power. The Rio Nogales Power Plant also purchases potable water, but the wastewater effluent purchase by the Power Plant reduces the amount of potable water needed by approximately 200,000,000 gallons annually. 
(3)  The discharge from the Rio Nogales Power Plant flows to the Geronimo Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, where the discharge is treated. This discharge has a high concentration of minerals and if discharged back to the Walnut Branch Plant, it would reduce the amount of effluent capable of being reused by the power plant. 
(h)  Retrofit programs: 
(1)  The building codes adopted by the City of Seguin contain within their guidelines retrofit recommendations that the city building official is enforcing. 
(2)  All local plumbing suppliers and hardware stores in Seguin stock water-saving devices and encourage their use. 
(i)  Plumbing codes. The city has adopted the 2009 International Residential Code, the 2009 International Building Code and the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code. 
(j)  Coordination and regional planning groups. The City of Seguin is a customer of a wholesale water provider. Water is purchased from the Schertz Seguin Local Government Corporation ("SSLGC"). The SSLGC has participated in the strategic water planning process by providing information to the South Central Regional Water Planning Group (initially designated and known as Region L). The City of Seguin has also participated in the South Texas Regional Water Planning group by providing a copy of its water conservation plan, data on water consumption and commenting on future population growth. 
(k)  Conservation plan and goals. The city's water conservation plan and water conservation goals shall be posted on the city's website. Additionally a copy of the conservation plan and goals shall be available in the office of the city secretary.

--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-23, adopted May 20, 2014, amended art. VII by changing the title from emergency water demand management plan to drought contingency and water emergency response plan. 

Sec. 102-292. - Introduction. 
    It is important to distinguish between water demand management planning from water conservation planning. While water conservation involves implementing permanent water use efficiency or reuse practices, water demand management plans establish temporary methods or techniques designed to be used only as long as an emergency exists. An emergency condition can include drought, plant or distribution system failure or deterioration of water quality in the water source. 
(Ord. No. 96-38, § 1, 5-21-96; Ord. No. 96-45, § 1, 7-2-96) 
Sec. 102-293. - Objective. 
    The objective of the emergency water demand management plan is to provide procedures for voluntary and mandatory actions to be placed into effect to temporarily reduce the demand placed upon the City of Seguin's water supply system during a water shortage emergency. Emergency demand procedures not only include conservation but also includes prohibition of certain uses. 
(Ord. No. 96-38, § 1, 5-21-96; Ord. No. 96-45, § 1, 7-2-96; Ord. No. 2014-23, § 1, 5-20-14)

Sec. 102-360. - Capital recovery fees per service unit. 
(a)  The maximum capital recovery fee per service unit for each conceptual service area shall be computed by dividing the growth-related capital construction cost of service in the conceptual service area identified in the capital improvements plan for that category of capital improvements, by the total number of projected service units anticipated within the conceptual service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development, based on the land use assumptions for that conceptual service area, and adjusted by subtracting credits in the form of future rate or tax contributions to water and/or wastewater CIP funding. Maximum capital recovery fees per service unit for each conceptual service area shall be established by category of capital improvements and shall be available from the city's planning department. 
(b)  The effective capital recovery fee per service unit which is to be paid by each new development shall be that established by the city council, as may be amended from time to time, and shall not be more than the maximum capital recovery fee per service unit established in subsection (a) above. Capital recovery fees which are to be paid by developers shall be posted on a list maintained by the city's department of planning. 
(c)  The maximum capital recovery fee may be amended by the city council according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code and its successors.

Sec. 102-361. - Assessment of capital recovery fees. 
(a)  The approval of any subdivision of land or of any new development shall include as a condition the assessment of the capital recovery fee applicable to such development. 
(b)  Assessment of the capital recovery fee for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations following the effective date of this article, assessment shall be at the time of final subdivision plat approval, and shall be the value of the effective capital recovery fee per service unit then in effect. The city may provide the subdivider with a copy prior to final subdivision plat approval, but such shall not constitute assessment within the meaning of this article, as actual assessment shall occur on the date the corresponding plat is approved. 
(2)  For new development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this article and for which no replatting is necessary prior to the issuance of a building permit, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit, and shall be the value of the effective capital recovery fee per service unit in effect on the date of application for the aforementioned building permit. 
(3)  For new development which occurs or is proposed to occur without platting, assessment shall be upon the issuance of a building permit or water or sewer tap (whichever occurs first), and shall be the value of the effective capital recovery fee in effect at the time of application for the building permit or tap for water or sewer. 
(4)  Fees shall not be assessed to property which has previously purchased taps for the property and which desires to exchange those purchased taps for taps which will reflect an equivalent number of LUEs, as determined under section 102-359. If the exchange of said taps will result in an increase in the number of LUEs the purchaser shall be assessed the effective capital recovery fee in effect at the time of tap exchange, based on the additional LUEs required. 
(5)  Because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole, water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to collection of a capital recovery fee. 
(6)  Landscape meters for which water demand related solely to landscape irrigation demand shall be assessed a water capital recovery fee, but shall not be assessed a sewer capital recovery fee. 
(c)  Following assessment of the capital recovery fee pursuant to subsection (c), no additional capital recovery fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases, as set forth under section 102-359. 
(d)  Following the lapse or expiration of approval for a plat, a new assessment must be performed at the time a new application for such development is filed.

(a)  Following the request for new development as provided in section 102-361 of this article, the city shall compute capital recovery fees due for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The total service units for the new development shall be multiplied by the appropriate per-unit effective fee value determined as set forth in section 102-360; and 
(2)  Fee credits and offsets shall be subtracted as determined by the process proscribed in section 102-364 of this article. 
(b)  The value of each capital recovery fee due for a new development shall not exceed a value computed by multiplying the effective fee assessed per service unit pursuant to section 102-360 by the number of service units generated by the development.

(b)  Capital recovery fees shall be paid at the time of the issuance of a building permit, except as provided in subsection (c) or in subsection (d), in the amount shown as the effective capital recover fees as established by the procedures set forth in this article. 
(c)  For new development converting to the city water utility from an individual water well or to the city wastewater utility from a septic tank or individual waste disposal system, the city may allow the fee payer to pay capital recovery fees in the form of a monthly assessment in the same manner as monthly assessments for related tap fees, if such an extended payment program for tap fees is currently in effect , as provided below: 
(1)  At the request of the applicant, and with the approval of the city manager, the capital recovery fees for such customers may be paid in increments over a period of not more than two years, with interest computed on the unpaid balance at the statutory rate as allowed by Texas law. 
(2)  If the applicant chooses this extended payment option, the applicant shall, as a condition of tap sale, sign and file with the city secretary, and consent to the recordation of, a "notice of capital recovery fee due", which shall be recorded as a lien against the subject property. The city shall release the lien held only upon payment in full of the capital recovery fees and any late penalties and applicable interest. 
(3)  Late payments shall subject the applicant to a penalty of ten percent of the amount due and additional interest in addition to all other remedies available to the city as lien holder. 
(d)  The city may, at its sole discretion, enter into contracts to establish a different date of fee collection than those provided in this section. 
(e)  It shall be the policy of the city to attempt to revise any contracts which might exist with wholesale customers, or which in the future may be entered into for wholesale service, in such a manner that capital recovery fees are collected from the wholesale customer according to the number of LUEs attributable to each retail meter for new development within the wholesale customer's service area.

(a)  The city shall offset the present value of any system-related facilities, pursuant to rules established in this section, which have been dedicated to and have been received by the city, including the value of rights-of-way or capital improvements constructed pursuant to an agreement with the city, against the value of the capital recovery fee due for that category of capital improvement. 
(b)  The city shall credit capital recovery, pro rata, acreage or lot fees which have been paid prior to the effective date of this article against the value of a capital recovery fee due for that category of capital improvement, subject to guidelines established by the city. 
(c)  All offsets and credits against capital recovery fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this article and additional standards promulgated by the city, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines. 
(1)  No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  The unit costs used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the capital improvements plan for the category of facility within the conceptual service area for which the capital recovery fee is imposed. 
(3)  If an offset or credit applicable to a plat has not been exhausted within ten years from the date of the issuance of the first building permit after the effective date of this ordinance or within such period as may be otherwise designated by contract, such offset or credit shall lapse. 
(4)  In no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer for an offset or credit when no capital recovery fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to this article or for any value exceeding the total capital recovery fees due for the development for that category of capital improvement, unless otherwise agreed to by the city. 
(d)  An applicant for new development must apply for an offset or credit against capital recovery fees due for the development either at or before the time of plat recordation. The applicant shall file a petition for offsets or credits with the city on a form provided for such purpose. The contents of the petition shall be established by administrative guidelines. The city must provide the applicant, in writing, with a decision on the offset or credit request, including the reasons for the decision. The decision shall specify the maximum value of the offset or credit which may be applied against a capital recovery fee, which value and the date of the determination shall be associated with the plat for the new development. 
(e)  The available offset or credit associated with the plat shall be applied against a capital recovery fee in the following manner: 
(1)  Such offset or credit shall be prorated equally among all service units, as calculated in section 102-359, and remain applicable to such service units, to be applied at time of filing and acceptance of an application for a building permit, against capital recovery fees due. 
(2)  If the total number of service units used by the city in the original offset or credit calculation described in (1) is eventually exceeded by the number of total service units realized by the actual development, the city may, at its sole discretion, collect the full capital recovery fee exclusive of any associated offset or credits for the excess service units. 
(3)  At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative credit or offset agreements upon petition by the owner in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the city.

Otherwise, the word "may" is permissive. If a requirement or process in this code conflicts with another applicable local, county, state or federal law, the more restrictive standard applies. Photos are not considered official, adopted parts of this code. Photos and drawings used in the printed version of this code are examples intended to explain certain design concept, processes, or concepts. Some features shown in photos and drawings may not conform to other sections of this code.

Sec. 1.3. - Nonconformities. 
[1.3.0.]  [Nonconformities.] 
A.  General. Nonconformities are commonly called "grandfathered uses." A building, site, lot or use that was previously compliant becomes nonconforming if: 
  The zoning regulations change. 
  The use or building was first established when the property was outside Seguin, and the property was later annexed. 
  The use or building was first established before Seguin adopted zoning (1989). 
  A change in conditions in the area surrounding the property beyond the control of the property occurs, such as widening of a street therefore reducing the size of a lot or causing a structure to be closer to the right-of-way than setback standards permit. 
B.  Intent. The purpose of this section is to provide recognition of nonconformities and establish standards and procedures for bringing nonconformities into conformance. Use and ordinary maintenance of nonconforming uses, sites, and structures may continue, subject to the provisions of this chapter. The right to maintain a nonconforming use, building or structure runs with the land and is not ended by a change in ownership. 
C.  Types of Nonconformities. For the purpose of this ordinance there are four types of nonconformities: 
1.  Nonconforming uses. 
2.  Nonconforming Structures. 
3.  Nonconforming Sites. 
4.  Nonconforming Lots. 
1.3.1.  Nonconforming Uses. 
A.  General. A nonconforming use is any use that does not conform to the regulations of this Code on the effective date. A use shall be deemed a nonconforming use provided that: 
1.  Such use was in existence under and in compliance with the provisions of the immediately prior Zoning Ordinance; or 
2.  Such use was a lawful, nonconforming use under the immediately prior Zoning Ordinance; or 
3.  Such use was in existence at the time of annexation into the City, was a legal use of the land at such time, and has been in regular and continuous use since such time. 
B.  Standards. Nonconforming use standards are as follows: 
1.  A structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall not be permitted to be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or moved. 
2.  The use of the structure shall only be changed to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located. A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use provided that, once such change is made, the use shall not be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
3.  The existing nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
4.  If a nonconforming use is abandoned, any future use of the premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Code, and with any other applicable City codes or ordinances that are in effect at the time the use is resumed or the structure is re-occupied. A nonconforming use shall be deemed "abandoned" in the following circumstances: 
  The use ceases to operate for a continuous period of six months; 
  In the case of a temporary use, the use is moved from the premises for any length of time. 
  For purposes of calculating the six month period, a use is abandoned upon the occurrence of the first of any of the following events: 
º  On the date when the use of land is physically vacated; 
º  On the date the use ceases to be actively involved in the sale of merchandise or the provision of services; 
º  On the date of termination of any lease or contract under which the nonconforming use has occupied the land; or 
º  On the date a final reading of water and/or power meters is made by the applicable utility provider(s). 

1.3.2.  Nonconforming Structures. 
A.  General. Any structure, not including non-conforming signs, that lawfully exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its locations on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure shall be deemed a nonconforming structure provided that: 
1.  Such structure was in existence under and in compliance with the provisions of the immediately prior Zoning Ordinance; or 
2.  Such structure was a lawful, nonconforming structure under the immediately prior Zoning Ordinance; or 
3.  Such structure was in existence at the time of annexation into the City, was a legal structure at such time, and has been in regular and continuous use since such time; 
4.  Such structure was a conforming structure prior to ROW acquisition which reduced the required setback of a structure. 
B.  Standards. Nonconforming structures may be allowed to remain in existence as long as it remains otherwise lawful. The nonconforming structure is subject to the following provisions: 
1.  A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its structural nonconformity. 
2.  The structure may be altered to decrease its structural nonconformity or to meet the requirements of the current development regulations. 
3.  Nonconforming structures damaged or destroyed to an extent of 50% of its assessed valuation (per Guadalupe County appraisal district) must be demolished or reconstructed in full compliance to this code. 
4.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved.

The certificate of occupancy (CO) is the final construction document issued by the Building Official to authorize occupancy of a structure upon completion of all building and construction related issues. No building or structure shall be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy classification of a building or structure or portion thereof shall be made until the Building Official has issued a certificate of occupancy. It is sometimes necessary to request a temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) prior to the final certificate of occupancy being issued.

A temporary certificate of occupancy shall only be issued for commercial development in which the City Engineer, Director of Planning, Fire Department and Building Official have determined a plan for completing the appropriate work has been established. Temporary certificates should be issued only when incidental construction remains. Before the request will be considered, installed fire alarm and/or sprinkler systems must have passed field acceptance tests. It is important to remember that an approval to stock is for goods only; it is not authorization for people to occupy the structure. The TCO requires all the same inspections as a certificate of occupancy as well as additional fees and submittals. For this reason, do not view the TCO as a short cut to occupying the structure. In some circumstances, escrow payment may be required for any unfinished work. When required, the value of the escrow payment will be set at 110% of the value of the work to be completed.

B.  Incorporation of the historic resource, in its entirety, into the proposed project that would affect the location of the historic resource. 
iii.  When relocated, the historic resource shall remain in the City of Seguin. 
iv.  The structural condition of the historic resource has been examined so that it has been determined that the historic resource may be moved and that damage to the historic resource which would result for the move can be minimized. Stabilization of the historic resource prior to and/or during the move may be required. 
v.  A new location for the historic resource has been determined that would be compatible with the architectural aspects of the historic resource, to the extent possible. Consideration shall include the review of all of the following: 
A.  Size of the resource and destination lot; 
B.  Massing; 
C.  Architectural style; 
D.  Review of all adopted design guidelines by the Commission in determining compatibility; and 
E.  Other historic resources, which are not the primary resource on the site, but are historically associated with the primary resource, also should be relocated, if possible, and may be considered for relocation with the primary resource on the same certificate of appropriateness. 
vi.  Any historic resource relocated pursuant to this section shall be required to conform to any siting conditions at the new location. These siting conditions shall include, but are not limited to, setback requirements, structural alteration requirements such as enclosed parking requirements, and architectural requirements such as exterior finishes and orientation. 
vii.  The applicant agrees to the following additional conditions of the certificate of appropriateness. 
A.  The historic resource shall be secured from vandalism and other damage for the time that is remains vacant as a result of the relocation process. 
B.  The applicant shall be required to display a plaque, provided and paid for by the City, which documents the historic resource's original location, date of relocation, and reason for relocation. 
C.  The historic overlay shall convey with the historic resource to its new location. 
D.  The historic overlay shall be removed from the originating property, unless one of the following applies: 
d-1.  The property is located within an historic district; or 
d-2.  Only an accessory structure has been moved and the primary structure on the site remains; or 
d-3.  The site itself is historically significant. 
E.  The City may apply the historic overlay to the destination lot(s), by following the procedures for applying historic overlay in Section 29.8 of this code. If the historic resource is being moved into an already designated historic district, the historic overlay shall remain and apply to the destination lot or lot(s). 
F.  The applicant shall provide photographs to the HPO of the relocated historic resource once relocation is complete. 
G.  Information regarding the relocation shall be filed in the appropriate City and county records. 
h.  Appeals. Appeals of certificate of appropriateness decisions made by the Commission shall be made within fifteen (15) days to the City Council, through the office of the City Secretary, for review of the decision and the approval, denial, modification of, or deviation from, the HPO and the HPDC's decision. The appeal application shall be set before the City Council at the first available City Council meeting. The City Council's decision shall be final. 
E.  Ordinary maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance, or repair of any exterior architectural feature of an historic landmark or a property or structure within an historic district that does not involve a change in design or material, or outward appearance. In-kind replacement or repair and repainting is included in this definition of "ordinary maintenance", unless painting involves an exterior masonry surface that was not previously painted. However, no person shall make any material or aesthetic change in the light fixtures, windows, signs, sidewalks, fences, steps, paving, or other exterior elements visible from a public right-of-way which affects the appearance and cohesiveness of any historic landmark or any property within a historic district without applying for a Certificate of Appropriateness. The HPO shall determine what is "ordinary maintenance." 
F.  Minimum maintenance standards. 
a.  No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as an historic landmark or a property located within a historic district shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the significant deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the judgement of the Commission, create a detrimental effect upon the historic character of the landmark or district. 
b.  Examples of serious disrepair or significant deterioration include: 
i.  Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations, or other vertical support that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling. 
ii.  Deterioration of external chimneys that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling. 
iii.  Deterioration or crumbling of exterior plaster finishes, surfaces or mortars. 
iv.  Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, and foundations, including broken windows or doors. 
v.  Defective protection or lack of weather protection for exterior wall and roof coverings, including lack of paint, or weathering due to lack of paint or other protective covering. 
vi.  Rotting, holes, and other forms of material decay. 
vii.  Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails, window and door frames, cornices, entablatures, wall facings, and architectural details that causes delamination, instability, loss of shape and form, or crumbling. 
viii.  Deterioration that has a detrimental effect upon the special character of the district as a whole or the unique attributes and character of the contributing structure. 
ix.  Deterioration of any exterior feature so as to create or permit the creation of any hazardous or unsafe conditions to life, health, or other property. 
G.  Demolition by Neglect. 
a.  Demolition by Neglect refers to the gradual deterioration of a property when routine or minimum maintenance is not performed. The HPO and the planning department staff work together in an effort to reduce Demolition by Neglect involving properties with historic overlay zoning. A Demolition by Neglect citation as determined by the Commission may be issued against the owner of the property for failure to comply with the minimum maintenance standards by permitting the subject property to exhibit serious disrepair or significant deterioration as outlined in minimum maintenance standards herein. 
b.  Initial identification is made by visual inspection of the area by the HPO, a HPDC member, fire marshal or building official, or a written referral submitted by the public to the HPO. 
c.  Once the initial identification is made, followed by a preliminary determination by the HPO, the property owner shall be notified by U.S. mail of the defects of the building and informed of various incentive programs that may be available for repair. The letter may or may not include specific code violations. The owner is given thirty (30) days in which to respond to the preliminary determination by submitting a stabilization proposal to the HPO. The stabilization proposal will be presented to the HPDC at the next available meeting. If the HPDC approves the proposal, a Certificate of Appropriateness (if necessary) may be issued administratively by the HPO. The approval will detail the specific work which is necessary to correct the Demolition by Neglect conditions, as well as a time period to begin and complete the work. The HPO shall update the HPDC on the status of the property every thirty (30) days once work begins on the property. 
d.  If the property owner disagrees with the determination of the letter, they may request a hearing to present evidence that the property is not in neglect. 
e.  If the property owner receives the letter regarding the preliminary determination, but fails to respond, a second notice shall be sent in the same manner as described above. 
f.  If the property owner fails to receive and/or respond to the letter regarding the preliminary determination after two (2) attempts, the matter returns to the HPDC for a citation hearing. The HPO shall send a third notice via certified mail informing the owner of the hearing, the property is posted with a notice of the violation, surrounding property owners are notified via mail of the hearing, and a public hearing on the citation is scheduled. 
g.  At the public hearing the owner is invited to address the HPDC's concerns and to show cause why a citation should not be issued. The HPDC may take action to approve any proposed work, defer the matter to give the owner more time either to correct the deficiencies or make a proposal for stabilization, or issue a citation to the owner of the property for failure to correct the Demolition by Neglect conditions. If the property owner is given more time, the owner must put a bond in an amount to be determined by the HPDC, allowing the City of Seguin to make the necessary repairs if the owner fails to do so. 
h.  If the owner is cited for the condition of Demolition by Neglect of the property, he is given fourteen (14) days to submit a stabilization proposal to the HPO, and at the discretion of the HPDC, up to one (1) year to correct the defects. The HPO shall update the HPDC on the status of the property every thirty days once the work has begun on the property. 
i.  After being cited, if the owner fails to submit a stabilization proposal within the fourteen days, at the discretion of the City Attorney in consultation with the HPO and building official, the property owner will begin incurring fines as set forth in Section 1-14 of the City of Seguin's Code of Ordinances of up to $2,000 per day the property is in violation. If funds are available, the City may consider making the necessary repairs and placing a lien on the property. 
H.  Economic Hardship. 
a.  No certificate of appropriateness for demolition involving a claim of economic hardship may be approved, nor shall a demolition permit be issued by the City unless the owner proves compliance with the following standards for economic hardship: 
i.  The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return in its current or rehabilitated state, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible; and 
ii.  The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the current owner or by the purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return; and 
iii.  Earnest and reasonable efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it have failed; and 
iv.  The property cannot be moved or relocated to another site similar site or within the District. 
b.  The City shall adopt by resolution separate criteria for review in considering claims of economic hardship for investment for income-producing and non-income-producing properties, as recommended by the Commission. Non-income properties shall consist of owner-occupied single-family dwellings and non-income-producing institutional properties. All standards for review shall be made available to the owner prior to the hearing. The information to be considered by the City may include, but not be limited to, the following: 
i.  Purchase date price and financing arrangements. 
ii.  Current market value. 
iii.  Form of ownership. 
iv.  Type of occupancy. 
v.  Cost estimates of demolition plans for development. 
vi.  Maintenance and operating costs. 
vii.  Inspection report by licenses architect or structural engineer having experience working with historic properties. 
viii.  Costs and engineering feasibility for rehabilitation. 
ix.  Property tax information. 
x.  Rental rates and gross income from the property. 
xi.  Other additional information as deemed appropriate. 
c.  Claims of economic hardship by the owner shall not be based on conditions resulting from: 
i.  Evidence of demolition by neglect or other willful and negligent acts by the owner. 
ii.  Purchasing the property for substantially more than market value at the time of purchase. 
iii.  Failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs. 
iv.  Failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants. 
v.  Failure to provide normal tenant improvements. 
d.  Throughout the process, the applicant shall consult in good faith with the HPO, local preservation groups, and interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an alternative that will result in preservation of the property. Such efforts must be demonstrated to the Commission at the hearing. 
I.  Enforcement. All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness issued under the ordinance shall conform to any requirements included therein. It shall be the duty of the building inspector to inspect periodically any such work to assure compliance. In the event that work is not being performed in accordance with the certificate of appropriateness, or upon notification of such fact by the Commission and verification by the HPO, the building inspector shall issue a stop work order and all work shall immediately cease. The property owner shall then be required to apply for a hearing before the Commission to explain the non-compliance. No further work shall be undertaken on the project as long as a stop work order is in effect until a decision is rendered by the Commission on the application. 
J.  Downtown Historic District. 
a.  Applicability. The Downtown Historic District includes those blocks located in the Inner Lots and Acre Lots of the City of Seguin, Guadalupe County, Texas, as shown on the above map. Any person carrying out any work that requires a permit for exterior alteration, restoration, reconstruction, new construction, demolition, or moving of a landmark or property with a Historic Landmark Designation or located in a Historic District must first obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation Officer. 
b.  Uses. Please see section 3.4.3, land use matrix to identify uses permitted within the district. 
c.  Site Development Requirements. The required setbacks and landscape requirements do differ from the base zoning designation for properties within this overlay district. The front setback for all non-residential structures shall be the property line, except as may be allowed by the Historic Preservation & Design Commission. Please refer to those sections for specific requirements. Off street parking requirements shall not apply in the Downtown Historic District except for overnight lodging facilities (hotel, motel, or bed and breakfast).

3.4.2.  Unlisted Uses. It is recognized that new types of land use will arise in the future, and forms of land use not presently anticipated may seek to locate in the City. A new and unlisted use may be interpreted by the Planning Director as similar to a listed use if the unlisted use possesses the majority of characteristics of the listed use. If the unlisted use is deemed similar to a listed use by the Planning Director, no amendment of the Land Use Matrix is required. If the use is not deemed by the Planning Director to be similar to an existing listed use the unlisted use determination must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council and shall subsequently is treated as an ordinance amendment. 
    A person requesting the addition of a new or unlisted use shall submit to the Planning Director or his/her designee, all information necessary for the classification of the use, including but not limited to the following: 
A.  The nature of the use and whether the use involves residential activity, sales, services, or processing; 
B.  The type of product sold or produced; 
C.  Whether the use has enclosed or open storage and the amount and nature of the storage; 
D.  Anticipated employment typically anticipated with the use; 
E.  Transportation requirements - estimate of number of trips per day; 
F.  The nature and time of occupancy and operation of use; 
G.  The parking and loading requirements; 
H.  The amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic materials and vibration likely to be generated;

A.  The subdivision shall conform to the City of Seguin Comprehensive Master Plan. The subdivision layout shall be in accordance with existing easements, rights-of-way, restrictions and conditions. Where parks, trails, or roadways are identified on a City-adopted master plan the developer for which the park, trail, or roadway traverses through a specific property shall incorporate the park, trail, or roadway into the proposed concept. 
B.  The subdivision layout shall make reasonable provisions for development of and connection to adjacent land. All parcels shall have frontage on a public right-of-way. Land locked parcels shall not be permitted. 
C.  Lot sizes must conform to the minimum lot area, minimum lot width, and minimum yard standards required in the underlying zoning district; ETJ lots shall conform to the requirements of the interlocal cooperation agreement between Guadalupe County and the City of Seguin. 
D.  Lots that front on more than one street other than corner lots, resulting in the need for a large development perimeter walls along a roadway, shall be minimal or avoided. 
E.  The street pattern shall provide for adequate circulation within the subdivision and in a manner so as to discourage excessive through traffic on minor streets. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the comprehensive master plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public safety and convenience, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. If any portion of a collector or major street, as depicted by the City's master plan, traverses any part of the land being subdivided, that portion of the major or collector street as planned shall be incorporated into the subdivision plan. 
F.  The street layout shall be devised for the most advantageous development of the entire subdivision and shall conform to connecting streets in land adjacent to the new subdivision. Provision shall be made within the subdivision to provide street access to adjacent undeveloped acreage in such a way as to assure adequate circulation for future development. Dead-end streets and those which do not conform to adjacent established streets are to be avoided. 
G.  The street system layout shall be designed (insofar as practicable) to preserve natural features such as vegetation, creeks, views, and related amenities. 
H.  If the subdivision is located in a special flood hazard area as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the current scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Guadalupe County, Texas and Incorporated Areas," dated November 2, 2007, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated November 2, 2007 the subdivision is subject to the standards of Chapter 54, Floods of the City Code.

    When a subdivider proposes that any part of a subdivision, planned development, or any other development of land include any privately maintained facilities (e.g. community postal box pavilion, private park, streets, amenity, drainage or detention facilities, or any other improvement), a property owner's association (or comparable mechanism) shall be created and be responsible for the following: 
  Maintenance. Total responsibility for maintenance in perpetuity of such private improvements is borne by the association. 
  Funding program. A program is established whereby the association can accomplish the maintenance of private facilities. 
    The documents creating the required property owner's association shall be reviewed and approved by the City Attorney prior to the recordation of the first subdivision plat for the proposed subdivision. 
Sec. 4.6. - Stormwater and drainage standards. 
4.6.1.  General Requirements. All proposed developments shall provide for new drainage facilities, the improvement of existing drainage facilities, channel improvements, grading, driveway adjustments, culvert improvements or other drainage improvements determined by the City Engineer to provide for the stormwater drainage needs of the development and the downstream areas impacted for a distance of 2,000 feet downstream from the proposed development; provided however, that if any appreciable adverse impact still exists at that distance, the City Engineer may require that additional drainage facilities be constructed to the point where any remaining adverse impacts are de minimums. The developer shall verify and provide to the City Engineer all necessary information and calculations to demonstrate that the capacities of these systems are not exceeded as a result of the proposed development and the developer shall be responsible for constructing the needed improvements (at no cost to the City). 
    It is the responsibility of the developer to provide for conveyance of off-site water. The developer's design package submitted to the City shall include a description of all potential off-site impacts caused by the development and the proposed mitigation procedures for the impacts, including, but not limited to: 
º  Alteration of existing upstream drainage areas and/or conveyance systems due to the proposed development. 
º  The detention facility discharge shall be located to provide the least impact on downstream conditions, including requirements for the discharge to be routed to street curbs, bar ditches, storm sewer or other drainage way. 
º  The impact of flow concentration from the detention facility discharge point on existing drainage areas and/or conveyance systems. 
º  Extension of existing conveyance systems through the development. 
º  The altering of existing on-site conveyance systems. 
    In order to mitigate the impact of the proposed development, the phasing of development, the use of off-site control methods or the construction of off-site drainage improvements may be necessary. Calculations to verify downstream adequacy shall be performed to the nearest receiving waterway(s). Should projected stormwater runoff from the proposed development exceed the capacity of the existing drainage facilities and/or natural channels, the developer shall be responsible for improving the existing facilities at its own cost. 
4.6.2.  Design criteria. All drainage systems shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the UDC Technical Criteria Manual and City of Seguin Standard Details. 
4.6.3.  Stormwater Management. Stormwater management shall be designed and constructed to prevent adverse conditions from arising on property adjoining and downstream of the subdivision site. Adverse conditions include increases in peak flows, water surface elevations, concentration of flow and flow velocity. The drainage report shall show that mitigation of the impacts of development on the drainage system will be provided as part of the development. Mitigation may include detention, retention, infiltration, channel improvements, and other means acceptable to the City Engineer. Stormwater Management facilities shall be designed to reduce post-development peak flow rates of discharge to pre-development rates for the 2-, 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year storm events at all points of discharge. The drainage report shall also include an evaluation of downstream conditions. 
4.6.4.  Detention and Drainage Facilities. On-site stormwater detention shall be required for all new developments to offset increased runoff resulting from new developments except for those developments for which approved regional detention facilities have been established or for which alternate plans have been approved by the City Engineer.

4.7.10.  Wastewater. All wastewater systems shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the UDC Technical Manual and City of Seguin Standard Details. The sanitary sewerage system shall be designed so as to provide service to each developable lot within the subdivision, in accordance with applicable engineering design criteria and requirements of the State Department of Health. The use of on-site sewage facilities in subdivision development is prohibited within the City, but may be permitted on existing lots and minor plats where no main exists within 300 feet, with the approval of the City Engineer and Planning Director. All on-site sewage facilities must be in compliance with all local, state and federal requirements. No septic tank system can be installed on a lot or part of a lot that contains less than one acre, unless the subdivision includes four or fewer buildable lots. In addition, no part of a septic tank system shall be installed any closer to a flowing stream than 150 feet. Buildable lots, in this section, shall refer to lots in which a structure or building is allowed to be constructed on the lot. In either the City limits or within the extraterritorial jurisdiction, a subdivider may, in the alternate, install at his own expense a temporary or package sewerage treatment plant, provided the use of such plant is approved by the City Engineer. Such plant shall be designed to serve the property being subdivided and shall meet all applicable requirements of the state water quality board and Environmental Protection Agency, but in no event shall the effluent exceed the following requirements: 20 parts per million BOD; 20 parts per million suspended solids. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to secure all necessary discharge permits. The subdivision shall maintain the treatment plant until such time as the improvements within the subdivision are accepted by the City. 
4.7.11.  Main Extension. Refer to section 102-179 of the City's Code of Ordinances for all applicable requirements for subdivision development under this Chapter.

( Ord. No. 2016-01, § 1, 1-5-16 ; Ord. No. 2017-17 , § 2, 4-18-17; Ord. No. 2017-74 , § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 4.8. - Road adequacy standards. 
4.8.1.  General. New development must be supported by an adequate roadway network. It is necessary and desirable to obtain rights-of-way for off-site, abutting, and internal streets to support new development at the time of platting or development of the land. There must be a rough proportionality between the traffic impacts created by a new development and requirements placed on the property owner to dedicate and improve off-site and abutting street rights-of-way. The method for determining proportionality shall be identified in the Technical Manual. The City desires to assure both that development impacts are mitigated through contributions of street rights-of-way and improvements and that a development project contribute no more than its fair share of street costs. 
4.8.2.  Boundary Street Improvements. 
A.  Applicability. The developer's obligations concerning boundary streets are as follows: 
1.  For developments adjacent to minor streets and collector streets the developer shall be responsible for dedicating land for one-half of the required right-of-way of an adjacent minor street and/or collector street; and constructing improvements for one-half of the required width of adjacent minor street and/or collector streets, including curbs, gutters and storm drainage (if the applicable cross section requires curb and gutter). The City may allow cash payment in lieu of construction upon approval by the City Engineer. 
2.  For developments adjacent to major thoroughfare/arterials and larger streets the development shall be responsible for dedicating land for one-half of the required right-of-way (up to the developments proportional share of the right-of-way); and constructing the proportional share of the required street, including curb, gutter and storm drainage (if the applicable cross section requires curb and gutter). The City may allow cash payment in lieu of construction upon approval by the City Engineer. 
3.  When a roadway or other improvement listed in #1 or #2 above is included in the Capital Improvement Plan for Roadway Impact Fees, the developer may request offset or credits against capital recovery fees for roadways in accordance with the City's Code of Ordinances dealing with Capital Recovery Fees [102-364]. 
B.  Exemptions for Boundary Street Construction Payment and/or Construction. 
1.  For developments adjacent to designated, state or federal roadways no financial contribution other than dedication of right-of-way is required. 
2.  Developments in the ETJ that create 4 lots or less. 
3.  Development in the ETJ which front on a street which is not identified on the Thoroughfare Plan. 
4.  Developments in the City that create 4 single-family lots or less and front on a street which has not been identified as a collector, major or minor thoroughfare (only applicable to streets already improved and accepted by the City). 
4.8.3.  Traffic Impact Analysis. 
A.  Applicability. All subdivision plats and project/driveway access request shall require a traffic impact analysis (TIA) form to be completed by the developer and approved by the City Engineer. A peak hour trips (PHT) generation form may also be required by the Planning Director, the Planning and Zoning Commission or the City Council as part of a zoning change application. The City Engineer and Planning Director may waive the requirement for a TIA on projects where the expected peak hour trips are less than 100. A TIA or peak hour trips (PHT) generation form shall be performed by the property owner or its agent. The type of submittal required shall be based upon the number of PHT generated by the proposed development, as set forth in the following table: 
B.  TIA Table Submittal Type. 
Peak Hour Trips (PHT) Submittal Type 100 or less PHT Generation Form (no TIA required) 101-500 Level 1 TIA 501-1,000 Level 2 TIA 1,001 or more Level 3 TIA  
When the use or design of a site changes from that on which a previous TIA was submitted and accepted, the property owner or its agent shall perform and submit to the city an amended TIA. 
C.  Impact area. The impact area is the area within which any traffic impact analysis is conducted in order to determine compliance with the level of service standards. This area shall be based on the size of the development and the PHTs projected to be generated by the proposed development. The impact areas shall be established as shown in the following table: 
TIA Impact Area Table Submittal Type Impact Area Level 1 or Level 2 TIA The site and area within one-quarter mile from the boundary of the site. Level 2 TIA The City Engineer may require the area of study to be extended up to a maximum of one mile from the boundary of the site. Level 3 TIA The site and area within one mile from the boundary of the site.  
D.  TIA Requirements/Peak Hour Trips Generation Form and Application Materials. Please see UDC Technical Manual for specific requirements on analysis requirements. A study-scoping meeting with city staff may be required prior to starting a full traffic impact analysis. 
E.  City evaluation and action. The City shall evaluate the adequacy of the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) prepared by the applicant. Based upon such evaluation, the City shall determine whether the application may be approved in the absence of dedication of rights-of-way or construction of improvements to each affected thoroughfare and the extent of the applicant's obligations to make such dedications or improvements. The City shall condition the approval of the subdivision application on one or more of the following performances by the applicant: 
1.  Delay or phasing of development until thoroughfares with adequate capacity or intersection improvements are constructed; 
2.  A reduction in the density or intensity of the proposed development sufficient to assure that the road network has adequate capacity to accommodate the additional traffic to be generated by the development; 
3.  The dedication or construction of thoroughfares or traffic control improvements needed to mitigate the traffic impacts generated by the proposed development. 
( Ord. No. 2017-46 , pt. 1, 9-12-17) 
Sec. 4.9. - Parkland and open space dedication. 
4.9.1.  Application of Requirements. This section applies to all residential subdivisions in the following areas: 

* Subdivisions in the ETJ are subject to the requirements of fee-in-lieu of land dedication and park development. Public parkland dedication and park development is not accepted in the ETJ. 
4.9.2.  Intent. The primary purpose of the parkland requirements is to ensure that the need for parkland and park amenities that arises from new residential development is satisfied by the development, so that those who generate the need for park areas and recreation facilities contribute their proportionate share. In some instances, the need for parks and park improvements resulting from new development may be addressed most effectively through the development and acquisition of community or regional parks, or the improvement or expansion of an existing park serving several neighborhoods. 
4.9.3.  Applicability and Overview of Requirements. A subdivider or a developer of all residential subdivisions, not exempted by this ordinance, is required to set aside and convey to the public sufficient and suitable lands for the purpose of parkland, or contribute a fee in-lieu-of land conveyance, or a combination thereof, including park improvements as determined by the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Additionally, the requirements of this section shall apply when a property is being redeveloped from a non-residential use to a residential use. The following dedications and improvements must be installed before the approval of the final plat for a subdivision or issuance of a building permit for existing lots with proposed increase in density, in conformance to the standards of this section. It is highly encouraged that the subdivider meets with the Director of Parks and Recreation, or designee, early on in the conceptual stages of a subdivision to discuss the preferred location of parkland and park amenities needed. 
4.9.4.  General Provisions to this Section. 
A.  Subsequent Change. If the actual number of completed dwelling units exceeds the figure upon which the original parkland dedication/development or cash contribution was completed, such additional parkland dedication/development or cash contribution shall be required, and shall be made by payment of a fee in-lieu-of dedication/development, or by conveyance of an equivalent parkland and park development prior to the recordation of the final plat. All new lots within a replat or addition to an existing subdivision shall comply with the parkland dedication/development or cash contribution requirements as outlined in this section, as specified below. Sufficient land shall be dedicated and trails constructed within the residential subdivision as per the Seguin Comprehensive Master Plan and/or Parks and Recreation Master Plan. Unless specified otherwise by the Director of Parks and Recreation, or designee, all such trails shall be constructed of concrete and shall conform to the requirements of the American with Disabilities, as amended. Specifications for concrete shall be provided by the Director of Parks and Recreation, or designee. Trails in the Trails Master Plan shall be constructed in accordance with the Technical Manual by the developer at the developer's expense as trails are considered by the City as infrastructure. Trails shall be placed in a right-of-way or pedestrian access easement. Pedestrian access easements shall be a minimum of fourteen (14) feet in width. This may be a shared easement with public utilities as approved by the City. 
B.  Right of City to reject proposed parkland. If either the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board or the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that sufficient parkland already exists to serve the proposed subdivision or that the public would be better served by expanding existing parkland, the City may refuse the proposed dedication and require a cash payment as stipulated in this section. 
C.  Exceptions. This section shall not apply to: 
  Alterations or expansions of existing residential units or buildings of multiple units where no additional residential units are created and where the use is not changed. 
  Subdivisions with four or fewer lots fronting on an existing street. 
D.  Park Development Agreement. When the requirements of this section are proposed to be met by floodplain property, private parkland, offsite conveyance/improvements, a combination of dedication and fee-in-lieu, phased compliance, or any other means described in this section other than parkland dedication via subdivision plat along with associated parkland improvements of fee-in-lieu of dedication or improvement, the City may require a park development agreement between the City and the applicant to outline terms of compliance, City Council shall consider park development agreements based on criteria for parks and parkland in this section and general health, safety, and welfare. 
4.9.5.  Required Parkland Dedication or Contribution. 
A.  Calculation. At a minimum, the amount of land required to be dedicated for parkland will be calculated as one (1) acre of parkland dedicated for each seventy-five (75) residential dwelling units, or an equivalent ratio thereof. 
B.  Selecting a Location. 
1.  The Director of Parks and Recreation, or designee, will assist the developer in determining a suitable location for parkland dedication along with appropriate park amenities to install. Ultimately, the location of parkland dedication and appropriate park amenities to install shall be recommended by the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board to the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval. 
2.  The location of dedicated parkland may be required at the edge of a residential subdivision so that additional land may be added at such time as adjacent land is subdivided or acquired for public use. Unique or other natural areas that provide an opportunity for linkages between parks or that preserve the natural character of the surrounding environment, including riparian areas, may be required by the City to be included in the calculated areas dedicated for parks and recreational purposes. Otherwise, a centralized location within the residential development is preferred for dedicated parkland. 
C.  Floodplain Property. Each acre of proposed dedicated parkland that is located in a designated floodplain shall count as one-half acre of land towards the subdivider's required parkland dedication. Not more than 50 percent of the total acres to be dedicated as parkland shall be on land that is in a designated floodplain. Dedication of parkland within a floodplain shall be readily accessible by road frontage and of suitable topography for recreational activities as identified by the Director of Parks and Recreation, or designee. 
Example: 
750 homes planned = 10 acres parkland dedication required 
Since floodplain acreage only counts half, 10 acres of floodplain land would count towards 5 acres of required dedications. The remaining 5 acres must be outside the floodplains, so the dedication would be as follows: 10 acres in floodplain plus 5 acres outside floodplain to meet the 10-acre dedication. 
D.  Private Parkland Dedication. Up to 75 percent of a subdivision's required parkland dedication and park development requirements may be satisfied through the dedication of private parkland, subject to a recommendation by the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board to the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval. Either public dedication or fees in-lieu-of dedication and development, to be determined by the City, may satisfy the remaining portion. See below section for additional requirements. 
E.  Fee In-Lieu-Of Parkland Dedication and Park Development. The City may, at its option, require a fee to satisfy the parkland dedication and park development required under the following circumstances: 
1.  When less than two acres of parkland is required to be conveyed. 
2.  When a replat or amending plat within the City limits is submitted with increased density. 
3.  When the City determines that the potential for that subdivision would be better served by expanding or improving an existing nearby park or constructing and/or improving a larger community or regional park suitable for several neighborhoods. 
4.  When the development is located in the ETJ. 
5.  When the density on an existing lot is being increased. 
6.  Any multifamily project. 
4.9.6.  Methods of Parkland Dedication or Contribution. 
A.  General. Whenever a final plat is filed with Guadalupe County for residential development in accordance with the platting regulations of the City, such plat shall contain a clear fee simple dedication of an area of land to the City for parks and recreational purposes. The subdivider shall meet with the Director of Parks and Recreation, or designee, as to the preferred location of parkland and park amenities needed. The Parks and Recreation Advisory Board shall make recommendations based upon the Seguin Comprehensive Master Plan and/or Parks and Recreation Master Plan, as adopted by the City, and the standards and provisions contained herein, to the Planning and Zoning Commission concerning the amount and location of parkland, including park amenities, and/or fees in-lieu-of parkland dedication and development. 
B.  Procedures for Parkland Dedication via Subdivision Plat. 
1.  Preliminary and Final Plats. Parkland to be conveyed shall be designated as public parkland on both the preliminary and final plats as "Parkland Dedicated to the City of Seguin" with the perimeter dimensions and acreage denoted. A note referencing the dedication shall be placed on the preliminary and final plat. Parkland to be privately owned and maintained shall be designated as private parkland and so noted on both the preliminary and final plat. 
2.  Deed Required. Prior to recording the final plat, the developer shall deliver to the City a deed, in a form approved by the City Attorney, conveying parkland shown on the final plat. The parkland deeded to the City shall not be subject to reservations of record, encumbrances, or easements that will interfere with the use of the land for parks and recreational purposes. The deed delivered to the City shall be recorded in conjunction with the recordation of the final plat. 
C.  Off-site Conveyance of Parkland and Park Improvements. Upon a recommendation by the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board to the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval, the City may accept parkland and park improvements that are not part of a subdivision in order to meet the parkland and park improvement requirements, subject to the following requirements: 
1.  At a minimum, parkland conveyance is in accordance with this section, as described above. 
2.  At a minimum, the site is improved in accordance with park improvements of this section, as described below. 
3.  At a minimum, the site meets the park development standards of this section, as described below. 
4.  A deed shall be required in accordance with the provisions above. 
D.  Private Parkland. Up to 75 percent of a subdivision's required parkland dedication and park development requirements may be satisfied through the dedication of private parkland, subject to a recommendation by the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board to the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval. Either public dedication or fees in-lieu-of dedication and development, to be determined by the City, may satisfy the remaining portion. Where park areas and recreational facilities are to be provided in a proposed subdivision, and where such areas and facilities are to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, these areas and facilities may satisfy the requirement of parkland dedication and park development if the following standards are met: 
1.  At a minimum, parkland dedication is in accordance of this section, as described above. 
2.  At a minimum, the park site is improved in accordance with park improvements of this section, as described above. 
3.  At a minimum, the site meets the park development standards of this section, as described below as identified by the Director of Parks and Recreation, or designee. 
4.  The private ownership and maintenance of such park areas and facilities are adequately provided for by recorded written park development agreement, conveyance, deed, plat, and/or restrictions. 
5.  The use of such areas and facilities are restricted for parks and recreational purposes by a recorded covenant, which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the City. 
6.  The property owners association or equivalent is responsible for the maintenance of the private parkland and any park amenities in perpetuity. The City Attorney shall review and approve the property owners association or equivalent documents as it relates to the maintenance of the private parkland and any park amenities. 
7.  In order to receive the private parkland credit, the developer shall provide documents to the City at the time of final plat filing sufficient to establish that the requirements as described above have been satisfactorily met.

Where planting of mitigation trees on site is impractical, in lieu of tree replacement, if approved by the Director of Planning, a payment of $100.00 per 1" diameter for every protected tree removed, shall be deposited in the Tree Trust Fund, in accordance with this ordinance. Requests for payment of fee-in-lieu of planting must demonstrate a unique circumstance in which the planting of the tree is not practical (topography, limited planting space, etc.). The request may not be based off of inconvenience or financial gain. 
5.  The Director of Planning may consider off-site tree replacement at his or her discretion and may consider said request from the developer/contractor. Maintenance of the off-site tree should be the responsibility of the owner/developer requesting off-site planting. 
6.  Tree Credits. In order to offer an incentive for tree preservation, a tree credit will be given towards the tree planting requirement in Section 5.2.4 for all protected trees that are preserved. Credits will be calculated on a one for one caliper inch basis, i.e. one 6" caliper oak retained = a caliper credit of 6" towards the planting requirement. 
7.  Tree Trust Fund. A tree trust fund shall be created for the purpose of purchasing, growing, and/or maintaining trees within the City limit. The Tree Trust Fund shall be administered by the Director of Planning in accordance with policies established by the Seguin City Council. 
C.  Tree Survey. Prior to approval of a building permit or site development permit for any nonresidential or subdivision development, the developer/contractor shall provide to the City the following materials: 
1.  A site plan depicting all existing and proposed improvements including new buildings, proposed utility location, easements, paving and grade changes; 
2.  A site plan indicating all protected trees and identifying said trees by type and caliper; 
3.  A description of protective measures that will be used in accordance with requirements as stipulated in this ordinance; 
4.  A list of all protected trees to be removed and identified on the site plan; 
5.  A list of replacement trees, including on-site and off-site, by type, diameter and location on the site plan. 
5.2.10.  General Planting Specifications. Unless otherwise specified above all plantings required by this section shall meet the following requirements: 
A.  [Generally.] Landscaping shall devoted to plant materials adaptable to this region, including, but not limited to, trees, shrubs, grasses, ground covers, mulch and other landscape features. 
B.  Shrubs and Hedges. Shrubs shall be a minimum of two (2) feet in height upon planting or 5-gallon or larger container grown. 
C.  Trees. A tree shall be minimum of 8 feet in overall height, with the exception of approved multi-trunk specimens, immediately upon planting, and a minimum caliper of 2 inches measured 4.5' from the ground. All trees shall be selected from the list provided in the Technical Manual. Variations may be permitted by City staff if it can be shown that the proposed tree(s) are adaptable to this region and provide similar drought tolerance as those recommended. 
D.  Grasses. Grass requiring copious amounts of water are discouraged, i.e. St. Augustine. Any generally accepted method of planting is approved, including hydro-mulching, seeding or sodding. 
E.  [Varieties required.] All planting material shall be of drought tolerant, disease resistant varieties, preferably indigenous species or those readily adaptable to this region. In addition, plantings of shrubs/groundcovers shall be located in a prepared planting bed. 
F.  Maintenance of Plantings. 
1.  Watering: Priority should be given to drought tolerant species. Xeriscape and drip irrigation designs are highly recommended. Mulching shall be included in designs in order to preserve water. 
2.  The owner, agent or manager of the property shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscape areas. Maintenance shall include watering, pruning, replacement and other activities necessary to keep the landscape area in a neat, healthy and attractive condition. 
3.  Whenever required maintenance, in accordance with this ordinance, is identified, the City shall notify the property owner and tenant of the required action in writing. The property owner/tenant shall have ten (10) days from the date of receipt of the written notification to advise the City of plans to correct the deficiency. Failure to remedy the maintenance problem, or an unacceptable plan to correct the maintenance problem, shall constitute a violation of the ordinance. 
4.  Plans for corrective maintenance may include the following: availability of plants, availability of water (drought policies), and availability of qualified contractors or work force. 
G.  Oak Wilt Abatement and Treatment. 
1.  All tree cutting/pruning wounds shall be immediately sealed with a tree paint or protective compound. 
2.  All infected tree cuttings (limbs, trunks) shall be disposed of in such a way as to not infect healthy oak trees. 
3.  All oak firewood shall be wrapped in a clear plastic covering, with ends tucked into the ground, from February 1 until June 15, to prevent the spread of oak wilt by insects. 
4.  All cutting/pruning tools shall be disinfected using a commercial disinfectant (i.e. bleach, Lysol spray) between each oak tree trimmed, pruned or removed. In addition to those precautions listed above, which are required of all commercial tree cutting businesses, residents are encouraged to consider the following. 
5.  If oak wilt is identified in the vicinity of other healthy oaks, particularly in a rural setting, trenching around the infected tree (cut at least 48" deep, then immediately filled) may prevent the underground transmission of the disease through the root system. Underground trenching is extremely difficult in an urban or suburban development because of the presence of underground utilities and the proximity of property lines. Therefore, in many cases this is not an option. 
6.  Tree injection with systemic fungicide for infected trees may be used as a preventative of the disease. A tree professional should be contacted to verify the extent of oak wilt infection and to outline treatment alternatives and specifications. County Extension Agents, Texas Forest Service representatives, or other professionals should be contacted before any treatment. 
( Ord. No. 2015-44, § 3, 7-21-15 ) 
Sec. 5.3. - Off-street parking and loading. 
5.3.1.  Intent. Off-street parking and loading requirements are established to ensure that all developments within the City provide adequate and reasonable parking necessary to serve the development or use. 
5.3.2.  Applicability. Off-street parking and loading standards required by this Chapter apply in the following circumstances, in addition to any additional standards or requirements provided for this Code: 
A.  New Development: The off-street parking and loading standards apply to any new building constructed and to any new use established. 
B.  Expansions and Alterations: In the case of a redevelopment of an existing site or structure only the new portion of the site or structure shall come into conformance with the applicable requirements of the off-street parking and loading section unless one of the following exists: 
1.  The redevelopment of the property includes a 50% or more increase in square footage; or 
2.  If the extent of the proposed modifications is 50% or more of the site's assessed value over a 5-year time period. For the purposes of the code the assessed value of a structure shall be the value cited by the Guadalupe County Appraisal District. 
In such case the site in its entirety must be brought into conformance with the requirements of this code. 
C.  Change in Use: The off-street parking and loading standards shall be required to be met when a change in use is proposed. 
5.3.3.  General Provisions. 
A.  Unclassified use: Where the proposed land-use cannot be classified within the uses herein specified, the Planning Director shall determine the specified use most closely related to the proposed use and the minimum requirements for the specified use so determined shall apply to the proposed use. 
B.  Parking spaces used for the parking of trucks or buses shall not be counted towards meeting the requirements of this section. 
C.  When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of 1/2 or less will be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than 1/2 will be rounded up to the next higher whole number. 
D.  A public street or right-of-way shall not be classified as off-street parking in computing the parking requirements for any use. 
E.  Compact parking spaces may account for up to twenty-five (25) percent of the total required off-street parking spaces.

5.3.4.  Exceptions and Permitted Reductions in Parking. 
A.  Off-street parking is not required for properties within the Downtown Historic District. 
B.  An Alternative Parking Plan may be approved by the Planning Director for the following instances: 
1.  Groups of uses requiring vehicle parking space may join in establishing group parking areas with capacity aggregating that required for each particular use. Where it can be established before the Planning Director that parking for two (2) specific uses occurs at alternating periods, the parking space requirements of the use requiring the greater number of spaces may be applied to both uses in a combined parking area. Such parking shall be within three hundred (300) feet of all uses to be served by such parking. Example: church and professional office building. A shared parking plan will be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Director for recordation. Recordation must take place before issuance of a Building Permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. 
2.  Specific uses which are deemed to require less parking than the standards outlined in this ordinance based on the following criteria: 
  The user provides a detailed breakdown of his/her parking requirements indicating employee counts, shift distribution and visitor or customer needs.

ARTICLE III. - ACQUISITIONS 

Sec. 1. - Artwork selection criteria. 
    Artistic integrity and highest quality of aesthetic experience will be the primary considerations in the selection of public art in Seguin. The following criteria shall be applied by SAC in the selection process: 
1.  Media: All visual art forms and materials consistent with the purpose of acquisition will be considered. 
2.  Quality: Artwork shall be of lasting value and artistic merit that will enhance the City's collection. 
3.  Audience: The artwork will be suitable for display to a diverse audience including children. It should enhance its setting and help create a sense of place. The City may not acquire public art that would, when displayed, create a hostile environment. 
4.  Style: The artwork should be suitable in scale materials and form for its surroundings, or capable of being suited in a variety of public areas. Artwork selected for the City's collection should advance the purpose specified by SAC at the time an acquisition project is undertaken. 
5.  Range: Artwork may be functional or non-functional; conceptual or tangible; portable or site specific; folk art, craft or fine arts; temporarily or permanently installed. 
6.  Condition and Permanence: The artwork will be of materials and method of construction suitable to the setting. Artwork for outdoor exhibition will be resistant to theft, vandalism, weathering, and constructed to avoid extensive maintenance and repair. At the time of acquisition, the artwork will be in good condition or worthy of restoration. 
7.  Technical Feasibility: The City will consider only such artwork for commissions from those artwork proposals it finds likely to be completed according to design. The City will only select artworks for which it has an immediate location. 
8.  Fiscal Feasibility: The City will consider only such artworks for which it possesses adequate funding for appropriate installation, display, maintenance, insurance and safeguarding. Prior to acceptance of a work, an estimate based upon past experience or knowledge of maintenance expenses associated with the proposed artwork shall be presented to the City Council by the SAC in its Acquisition Recommendation. 
9.  Public Safety: The City will not consider works that the City determines may pose a threat to public safety. 
Sec. 2. - Artwork selection process. 
    The City may acquire artwork for specific purpose (e.g. for a particular location or to commemorate an event) or in response to an offer of donation separate from a specific acquisition process. All acquisitions shall be approved by City Council. 
1.  Specific Purpose Acquisitions: When artwork is to be acquired for a specific purpose, SAC shall adopt a resolution stating the purpose of the acquisition and the process to be used for selecting artwork to be recommended to the City Council for acquisition. In the selection process, the SAC shall provide an opportunity for review of the proposed acquisition by any other City Agency or Commission that might be affected. All recommendations to the City Council shall be adopted by SAC at a regular or special meeting of SAC. 
2.  Proposed Donations: When artwork is proposed to be donated to the City, the proposed donation shall be reviewed by SAC. SAC may recommend immediate acceptance or rejection of the offer or may adopt a resolution establishing a process for further review of the offer. SAC shall consult with any other city agencies affected by the proposed donation. All recommendations to the City Council shall be adopted by SAC at a regular or special meeting. 
3.  SAC procedures: The SAC shall make recommendations by way of majority vote on the recommendation regarding the selection at issue. If it finds there is insufficient merit in the submission, make no selection. 
4.  Conflict of Interest: The SAC may not consider art owned or created by any member of the Commission. A Commission member who maintains a close personal or professional relationship with the artist submitting a proposal must recuse him/herself from the review. 
5.  Historic District: For any art that is proposed to be located in the Downtown Historic District, the SAC shall present the project for approval by the Historic Design Review Committee before making a recommendation to the City Council. 
Sec. 3. - Acquisition methods. 
    Artwork may be acquired by purchase, commission, donation, as follows: 
1.  Purchase: When an existing artwork satisfies the selection criteria of the Public Art Program or a specific public art project, SAC may recommend that the City Council authorize direct purchase of the artwork. 
2.  Commission: Based on a recommendation from SAC the City Council may award commissions by competition or invitation. The selected artist would be commissioned to create original work consistent with the artist's proposal. Commissions may be awarded as follows: 
a.  Juried invitational: Artists may be chosen through a competition, for which selected artists are invited to submit proposals according to criteria established by SAC. Such criteria will reasonably expedite the goals of the competition without unduly excluding qualified participation; or 
b.  Open Competition: Artists may be chosen through a competition whereby all artists are invited to submit their qualifications (RFQ) as demonstrated by past work, past experience with public art, and successful completion of previous projects similar in scope and demand. Those artists meeting the qualification requirements established by SAC will then be asked to submit a proposal; or 
c.  Invitation: Artists chosen by SAC on the basis of their qualifications, as demonstrated by past work, past experience with public art, and successful completion of previous projects similar in scope and demand will be asked or paid to develop a proposal; or 
3.  Donation: SAC may recommend that the City Council accept artwork offered as a contribution to the City by a citizen if the work satisfies Public Art Program selection criteria and an appropriate site exists to exhibit the work; or 
4.  Proposal: Artist may propose to the Commission specific artwork to be displayed at a specific location. The proposal should include design, list of materials and construction or installation costs. The Commission may review such proposal, including location, to see that it fits within the set criteria and budgetary restraints. 
Sec. 4. - Ownership of purchased, commissioned or donated artwork. 
1.  Artwork purchased, commissioned, or accepted as a donation will be the property of the City of Seguin. Title for each work will be transferred to the City as necessary.

Sec. 5. - Responsibilities of artists/donors. 
1.  When an artwork has been selected for inclusion in the Public Art Program, the artist or donor must agree to:

f.  Warrant that the work is the original product of the designated artist's creative efforts and does not infringe on any third party's copyrights or other intellectual property rights; and 
g.  Correct or allow correction of any safety issues not foreseen in the installation of the artwork, or that develop after the artwork has been on public view. 
Sec. 6. - Criteria for artwork placement. 
    When identifying the proposed location of artwork, SAC shall consider, public safety, visibility, lighting, traffic patterns (including interior, exterior, foot and auto), function of the existing facility or site, relationship of the proposed artwork to pre-existing artworks on the site, future development plans for the area, landscape design, environmental assessment, public accessibility, appropriateness of the physical characteristics of the site; and relationship of the social and cultural identity of the immediate local community. 
    With regard to public safety, no Artwork will be displayed before the City has inspected it and ascertained that it poses no threat to public safety. Through evaluation by qualified staff, the City will ascertain that no aspect of the installed artwork creates a substantial risk of injury when the work and any adjacent property are used with due care and in a reasonably foreseeable manner. The City will further ascertain that installation of the work will not pose a substantial or unreasonable risk of serious bodily harm to persons near the work or on adjacent property with due care appropriate to their age in a reasonably foreseeable manner. After an artwork has been installed, the City will monitor the installation as needed to ensure that no such risks are created due to changed circumstances. 
Sec. 7. - Relocation or removal of purchased or commissioned artwork. 
    The City may, as necessary or appropriate, transfer or remove a City-owned artwork from one public site to another, remove artwork to storage, or make a temporary loan of artwork to another agency or organization. 
1.  SAC will review proposals to relocate or remove a city-owned artwork and make a recommendation to the City Council. Considerations include, but are not limited to:

c.  Review written correspondence, press, and other public suggestions; 
d.  Explore means of resolving the concerns prompting the relocation proposal short of relocation or removal; 
e.  If no such means are satisfactory, seek a suitable relocation of the artwork. If the artwork was designed for a specific site, SAC will endeavor to relocate it to a site consistent with the artist's intention. If possible, SAC will obtain the artist's assistance in making this determination; and 
f.  If no relocation is suitable, SAC will seek to store the work or deaccession it consistent with the deaccession policy below. 
    Nothing in this policy shall limit the City's ability to take whatever action is deemed appropriate to protect human health and safety in the event of an emergency. 
ARTICLE IV. - DEACCESSION OF CITY-OWNED ARTWORK 
    The City of Seguin recognizes that the deaccession of artwork must be handled with great care, as concern that public art might be disposed of to pay operating expenses or satisfy changing desires of the City could discourage potential donors or artists. Moreover, haphazard deaccession could cause irreparable harm to the City's collection. The City of Seguin has a fiduciary obligation to maintain the collection for the benefit of its citizens. 
    SAC may recommend that an artwork should be permanently removed for from the City's collection according to the procedures established in this article. 

Sec. 1. - Criteria for selecting works for deaccessioning.

d.  Maintenance costs are higher than can reasonably be absorbed by the City; 
e.  The artwork requires repairs that are unfeasible; 
f.  The artwork's condition requires restoration in excess of its aesthetic value; 
g.  The work is so deteriorated that restoration would prove unfeasible or misleading; 
h.  As erected, the artwork poses risks to public safety not identified in the selection process; 
i.  It is determined that the work lacks significant aesthetic, historical and/or cultural value;

l.  The work is determined to be a copy or pastiche without significant historical, documentary, or aesthetic value; or 
m.  The work is determined to be a forgery or fake. SAC is responsible for ensuring that any such forgery or fake is identified as such when it leaves the City's collection. 
Sec. 2. - Deaccessioning review. 
    Every five years, or as needed, the SAC will review the City's collection and compile a list of those artworks it recommends by deaccessioned. SAC may also review and recommend that individual works be deaccessioned as necessary. The following procedures will apply: 
a.  SAC will prepare a written report for each artwork it recommends for deaccessioning, to be circulated to each SAC member one month prior to the meeting at which deaccession will be formally considered. The report will include:

ii.  Provenance; 
iii.  Slide(s) and/or photograph of the work;

e.  For artwork with the value of $500.00 or more. SAC will forward its report and the City Attorney's approval to the City Council for action by the City Council. Artwork with a value of less than $500.00 may be deaccessioned without Council approval; and 
f.  When the formal decision to deaccession has been reached, the work will be removed from the City's insurance log and the acquisition file will be retrieved, annotated in red as "Deaccessioned", and transferred to a deaccessioned file located in the Department of Recreation. All documentation regarding the deaccession of the work, including the report of SAC, the approval of the City Attorney, and the correspondence with the donors or heirs will be filed herein. 
Sec. 3. - Notifying donors/heirs. 
    Once it is determined that a work is to be deaccessioned, the City will make all reasonable effort to locate the donor or his/her heirs. The city will explain in writing its decision to deaccession the work and the other appropriate assurance that: 
a.  If the work is sold, the City will attempt to use any monies realized to purchase other works for the collections; and 
b.  Every effort will be made to honor the wishes of the donors/heirs concerning the sale. Written concurrence of donors/heirs will be solicited, but is not required. 
Sec. 4. - Disposal procedures.

iii.  The City may sell the work through competitive bidding; and 
iv.  The City may sell the work at a Public Sale. 
b.  Trade. Trade or Exchanges may be negotiated under special circumstances with a dealer or artist. The City may also trade a work to be deaccessioned for another work by the same artist. 
c.  Destruction. If a marginally significant work has deteriorated to such an extent that it is irreparable and unsuitable for exhibition SAC may, with the approval of City Council, elect to destroy it upon deaccession. 
d.  Negotiation. The City Council may authorize SAC to determine the best manner to negotiate the sale or trade of a deaccessioned work. After soliciting estimates from at least three dealers, SAC shall choose the offer most favorable to the City and negotiate terms with the agent on behalf of the City. Copies of all such agreements will be filed in the deaccession folder of the relevant work. 
    No works may be sold, traded or transferred to a member of the Seguin Municipal Arts Commission., its support staff, or its agents, or the City Council. Once deaccessioned from the City's collection, the work may not be installed on City property.

The Commission will transmit a final report informing City Council of the removal of the object from the City's collection. 
Sec. 5. - Monies raised from the deaccession. 
    All monies raised from the deaccession will be deposited into the City's General Fund. The City will endeavor to use such funds for future acquisitions.
