PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Port Neches, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, as supplemented through September 4, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1962 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. H. P. Wright, City Attorney, and Ms. Nancy Doise, City Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Former Charters were adopted on April 4, 1967, and April 16, 1955. 
State Law reference- Adoption, amendment, etc., of home rule Charter, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 9. 

ARTICLE I. - FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND BOUNDARIES 

Sec. 1.01. - Form of government. 
    The municipal government provided by this Charter shall be known as the "Council-Manager Government." Pursuant to its provisions and subject only to the limitations imposed by the State Constitution, the statutes of this State and by this Charter all powers of the City shall be vested in an elective council, hereinafter referred to as the "City Council," which shall enact local legislation, adopt budgets, determine policies and appoint the City Manager, who in turn shall execute the laws and administer the government of the City. All powers of the City shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this Chapter, or if the manner be not prescribed, then in such manner as may be prescribed by ordinance, the State Constitution or the statues of the State. 
Sec. 1.02. - The boundaries. 
    The boundaries of the City of Port Neches are and shall be those in existence as of January 1, 1967. Such boundaries in existence as of January 1, 1967, shall remain in effect until such time as the City Council may make amendments thereto. 
Sec. 1.03. - Extension of boundaries. 
    The boundaries of the City of Port Neches may be enlarged and extended by the annexation of additional territory in any of the methods hereinafter designated: 
(a)  Extending limits in accordance with State of Texas applicable law: Where such additional territory adjoins the corporate limits of the City and contains three or more inhabitants qualified to vote for members of the state legislature, such adjacent territory may be annexed to the City in the manner and in conformity with the procedure set forth in State of Texas applicable law, as now or hereafter amended. 
(b)  Extension of limits by election: The City Council shall have the power to order an election or elections for the purpose of annexing territory lying adjacent to the City of Port Neches. Such order shall include the survey notes of the area sought to be annexed. The City Council shall give notice of the date and place of balloting at such election by publication of the order in the official newspapers of the City at least thirty days prior to date on which such election is ordered. The residents of the City of Port Neches and the territory sought to be annexed, who are qualified to vote for members of the state legislature, shall be qualified to vote at such election. The City Council shall, at its next meeting, canvass the return of such election and if a majority of the votes cast at such election by the residents of Port Neches, and if a majority of the votes cast at such election by the residents of said territory being considered for annexation, favor such annexation, the Council shall declare the said territory annexed to the City of Port Neches, and the boundary limits of the City of Port Neches shall thereafter be extended and fixed so as to include such territory. 
(c)  Annexation of unoccupied lands on petitions of owners: The owner or owners of any land which is without residents, or upon which less than three voters reside, contiguous and adjacent to the City may, by petition in writing to the City Council, request the annexation of such contiguous and adjacent land describing it by metes and bounds. The City Council shall thereafter, and not less than five and not more than thirty days after the filing of such petition, hear such petition and the arguments for and against the same, and grant or refuse such petition as the City Council may see fit. If the City Council grants such petition, it may by proper ordinance receive and annex such territory as a part of the City. 
(d)  Annexation by amendment to charter: The boundary limits of the City may be fixed and additional territory added or annexed thereto by amendment to the charter of the City. 
(e)  Extending limits by action of the City Council: The City Council may by ordinance annex territory lying adjacent to the City, with or without the consent of the inhabitants in such territory or the owners thereof, not inconsistent with the procedural rules prescribed by law applicable to cities operating under Charters adopted or amended under Article XI, Section 5, of the Constitution of the State of Texas. 
(f)  Additional territory may also be annexed to the City in any manner and by any procedure that may now be provided by law or that may be hereafter provided by law. Same shall be in addition to the methods herein provided.

Protect customer identifying information. In order to further prevent the likelihood of identity theft occurring with respect to utility accounts, the utility will take the following steps with respect to its internal operating procedures to protect customer identifying information: 
(1)  Ensure that its website is secure or provide clear notice that the website is not secure; 
(2)  Where and when allowed, ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and computer files containing customer information; 
(3)  Ensure that office computers are password protected and that computer screens lock after a set period of time; 
(4)  Change passwords on office computers on a regular basis; 
(5)  Ensure all computers are backed up properly and any backup information is secured; 
(6)  Keep offices clear of papers containing customer information; 
(7)  Request only the last four digits of Social Security numbers (if any); 
(8)  Ensure computer virus protection is up to date; and 
(9)  Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that are necessary for utility purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2008-17, § 2(Exh. A, § V), 11-6-2008) 
Sec. 2-90. - Program updates. 
    This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in risks to customer and the soundness of the utility from identity theft. At least annually, the program administrator will consider the utility's experiences with identity theft situation, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts the utility maintains and changes in the utility's business arrangements with other entities, consult with law enforcement authorities, and consult with other city personnel. After considering these factors, the program administrator will determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the program administrator will update the program or present the city council with his or her recommended changes and the city council will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the program. 
(Ord. No. 2008-17, § 2(Exh. A, § VI), 11-6-2008) 
Sec. 2-91. - Program administration. 
(a)  Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies with an identity theft committee for the utility. The committee is headed by a program administrator who may be the head of the utility or his or her appointee. Two or more other individuals appointed by the head of the utility or the program administrator comprise the remainder of the committee membership. The Program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of utility staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program. 
(b)  Staff training and reports. Initially, all utility staff shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected. Thereafter, all utility staff shall undergo update training not less than annually. Additionally, all new utility employees shall undergo training. 
All utility staff shall submit reports monthly concerning the utility's compliance with the program, the training that has been given and the effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft, including recommendations for changes to the program. While incidents of identity theft are to be reported immediately to the program administrator, the monthly reports shall contain a recap of the incident and include the steps taken to assist with resolution of the incident. 
(c)  Service provider arrangements. In the event the utility engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, including, but not limited to, franchise utility providers, the utility will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. 
(1)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and 
(2)  Require, by contract or contract amendment, that service providers review the utility's program and report any red flags to the program administrator. 
(d)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the utility's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices are to be limited to the identity theft committee and those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.

The official time will begin when Port Neches Fire Department is notified of the priority one call and end when the ambulance is on scene with MICU transport capabilities (paramedic on scene). However, if the call has been triaged by an emergency medical dispatcher and meet current EMD guidelines of a nonlife-threatening medical emergency, the call can be reclassified by the EMS providers dispatch as a priority two call. 
(d)  EMS providers will have a maximum response time of ten minutes 59 seconds to all priority two medical calls 95 percent of the time. The official time will begin when the Port Neches Fire Department is notified of the call and end when the ambulance is on scene with MICU transport capabilities (paramedic on scene). 
(e)  All response times will be computed on a calendar-month basis. 
(f)  The Port Neches Fire Chief shall determine compliance with the 95-percent requirements on priority one and priority two calls. If a provider is found to be out of compliance with minimum response times specified in this article, the provider will be notified of the findings. The EMS provider will immediately take all steps necessary to remedy these problems, including, but not limited to, increasing the number of in-service ambulances available. 
(g)  In determining whether a run to a call is exempt from the response time standard, the following factors shall include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Any calls where information on medical need is not immediately available. (This situation exists when an ambulance is not originally dispatched after the PSAP receives the call, but is subsequently requested by on-scene police, fire, or public safety personnel). 
(2)  Ambulances that are unable to proceed due to an intersection blocked by a train or other unforeseeable traffic stoppages. (Ambulances will immediately notify their dispatch and Port Neches Fire Department when an ambulance is blocked by a train and when the train is cleared and travel resumes). 
(3)  In the event of MCIs, the initial responding ambulance will meet required response times. All others shall be accountable to the medical officer on scene for the type of response needed. 
(4)  Any severe weather conditions including dense fog, heavy rain or flooding, snow, or ice, except if inclement weather was predicted sufficiently in advance that levels of preparedness should have been increased and such steps not taken. 
(5)  Any situations where the dispatch center received false or inaccurate information or was unable to obtain adequate response information. 
(6)  Calls for standby at fire service calls. 
(7)  Calls for standby at law enforcement incidents. 
(h)  The EMS provider's senior paramedic on a medical scene shall determine if the patient requires ALS care (EMT-I), or MICU care (EMT-P) for the transport of a patient to an emergency-medical facility. This will be the sole responsibility of the EMS provider's senior paramedic and reflect the company's medical director's guidelines via standing protocols or online medical direction. At no time shall the senior paramedic or other EMS personnel delay the transport of sick or injured patients stable or unstable to allow for another ambulance to transport. 
(i)  The incident command system will be used on all mass casualty incidents (MCI). The incident commander will be the most senior firefighter or police officer on scene. All emergency medical, fire, police, and public safety personnel will report to the incident commander or his/her designee for accountability. At no time will any emergency response personnel enter the scene without notifying the incident commander or his/her designee of their presence. 
(j)  The EMS provider that initially responds to an MCI shall provide a liaison (medical officer) to the incident commander to assist with coordinating EMS response and transport. 
(k)  The medical officer shall not be involved with direct patient care and shall be available to the incident commander at all times. 
(l)  The medical officer shall be responsible for accountability of EMS personnel, number of patients, types of transportation needed, and the status of local emergency medical facilities. The medical officer may delegate responsibilities to other EMS staff on scene, but will remain responsible to the incident commander for EMS operations for that incident. 
(m)  EMS providers shall respond, at minimum, an ALS ambulance priority two to all known structure fires or incidents that could be hazardous to life or health. Central dispatch shall notify the EMS provider on rotation the location, type, and any known response hazards that may exist at the scene of the stand-by. 
(n)  Ambulances that respond to a scene designated as a standby, should stage in an area that would enable the EMS personnel to render speedy medical attention and transport if needed. These ambulances shall not stage in any area that would prevent transporting immediately from the scene or interfere with emergency operations. 
(o)  If the EMS provider is unable to respond to a standby, the incident commander shall be notified via central dispatch. The EMS provider shall make every effort to supply an ambulance in an expedient manner. 
(p)  EMS providers that respond to a standby may at any time request the ambulance be returned to service when it is deemed necessary by the EMS provider. 
(q)  EMS vehicles responding to emergency calls within the city response area shall be operated in accordance with Texas traffic laws pertaining to emergency vehicles as outlined in V.T.C.A., Transportation Code chapter 546, as currently defined and subsequently amended. The EMS provider shall ensure all employees know and understand these traffic laws. 
(Ord. No. 2004-14, § 1, 10-21-2004) 
Sec. 42-39. - Vehicle inspections. 
(a)  Every EMS vehicle which operates in the city response area shall be made available to the fire chief or his designee for inspection upon request. The EMS provider will be notified of the unit or units to be inspected. There shall be only one ambulance at the fire station being inspected at a time. This unit will be brought to the Port Neches Fire Department for inspection before 5:00 p.m. the day of request. However, if the request is made after 1:00 p.m., the EMS provider may request to have the inspection the following business day. 
(b)  Every ambulance operated by a permitted EMS provider may also be spot inspected at any time. The EMS vehicle will not be kept out of service for any length of time and shall be returned to service immediately if the ambulance is needed. However, if the ambulance is unsafe or found to be out of compliance with this article or any federal or state laws, the ambulance permit will be suspended immediately. (See subsection (f)). 
(c)  If there is reason to believe an ambulance is in violation of state or local rules or regulations, the fire chief or his designee may suspend the ambulance permit. The ambulance will not be allowed to return to service until it has been inspected and meets all state and local rules and regulations. 
(d)  When inspecting an EMS vehicle, it will be taken into consideration that the ambulance has been in service and reasonable usage of supplies will have occurred. No ambulance shall respond to calls of any nature, emergency or transport, within the service area if the supplies are below the EMS provider's protocols minimum. 
(e)  An ambulance permit may be suspended at any time an ambulance fails an inspection. This will not be used as a reason for poor response times. It is the EMS provider's responsibility to maintain the ambulances, equipment, and supplies as set forth by the state, this article, and the EMS provider's protocols. 
(f)  Any EMS vehicle that has had its ambulance permit suspended will not be allowed to operate in the city response area until the ambulance has passed reinspection. When the ambulance has met all requirements of this article and all applicable state laws, the ambulance permit will be reinstated and the ambulance may return to service. 
(g)  A record of all revoked or suspended ambulance and or provider's permits, and any incident reports will be kept in the EMS provider's file. This information will be used when considering the renewal of an EMS providers permit and for assessing penalties or fines. 
(Ord. No. 2004-14, § 1, 10-21-2004) 
Sec. 42-40. - Liquidated damages as remedy.

(1)  For failure to respond within seven minutes 59 seconds following dispatch for two consecutive months on a minimum of 95 percent of priority one calls, the EMS provider shall be assessed a fine of $2,000.00 for each percentage point below the 95 percent level. 
However, if an ambulance has an extended response time of more than 15 minutes to any priority one call, there can be assessed a fine of $500.00 per incident. 
(2)  For failure to respond within ten minutes 59 seconds following dispatch for two consecutive months on a minimum of 95 percent of priority two calls, the EMS provider shall be assessed a fine of $1,000.00 for each percentage point below the 95 percent level.

(c)  The EMS provider will have ten calendar days from the receipt of notice to appeal the assessment to the Port Neches Fire Chief.

ARTICLE IV. - WATER CONSERVATION PLAN 

Sec. 46-125. - Introduction and objectives. 
    Water supply has traditionally been a key issue in the development of Texas. In recent years, the increasing population and economic development in region I have led to growing demands for water. At the same time, local and less-expensive sources of water supply are largely developed. Additional supplies to meet higher demands will be expensive and difficult to develop. Therefore, it is important that the city make efficient use of existing supplies in order to utilize these sources as long as possible. Such efforts will delay the need for new supplies, minimize the environmental impacts associated with developing new supplies, and delay the high cost of additional water supply development. 
    Recognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has created guidelines and requirements governing the development of water conservation and drought contingency pans for public water suppliers. The TCEQ guidelines and requirements for water suppliers are included in appendix A. The city has adopted this water conservation plan pursuant to TCEQ guidelines and requirements. 
    The objectives of the water conservation plan are as follows: 
• To reduce water consumption; 
• To reduce the loss and waste of water; 
• To identify the level of water reuse; 
• To improve efficiency in the use of water; 
• To extend the life of current water supplies. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(Exh. A, § 1), 5-7-2009) 
Sec. 46-126. - Texas Commission on Environmental Quality rules. 
(1)  Conservation plans. The TCEQ rules governing development of water conservation plans for public water suppliers are contained in title 30, part 1, chapter 288, subchapter A, rule 288.2 of the Texas Administrative Code, which is included in appendix A. For the purpose of these rules, a water conservation plan is defined as: 
"A strategy or combination of strategies for reducing the volume of water withdrawn from a water supply source, for reducing the loss or waste of water, for maintaining or improving the efficiency in the use of water, for increasing the recycling and reuse of water, and for preventing the pollution of water. A water conservation plan may be a separate document identified as such or may be contained within another water management documents(s)" 
According to TCEQ rules, water conservation plans for public water suppliers must have a certain minimum content (Section 3), and must have additional content for public water suppliers that are projected to supply 5,000 or more people in the next ten years (section 46-127), and may have additional optional content (section 46-129). 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(Exh. A, § 2), 5-7-2009) 
Sec. 46-127. - Minimum required water conservation plan content. 
    The minimum requirements in the Texas Administrative Code for water conservation plans for public drinking water suppliers covered in this report are as follows: 
• §288.2(a)(1)(A)-Utility Profile-Section 46-127(1) and appendix C; 
• §288.2(a)(1)(B)-Specification of Goals before May 1, 2009-Section 46-127(2); 
• §288.2(a)(1)(C)-Specification of Goals After May 1, 2009-Section 46-127(2); 
• §288.2(a)(1)(D)-Accurate Metering-Sections 46-127(3) and (4); 
• §288.2(a)(1)(E)-Universal Metering-Section 46-127(4); 
• §288.2(a)(1)(F)-Determination and Control of Unaccounted Water-Section 46-127(5); 
• §288.2(a)(1)(G)-Public Education and Information Program-Section 46-127(6); 
• §288.2(a)(1)(H)-Non-Promotional Water Rate Structure-Section 46-127(7); 
• §288.2(a)(1)(I)-Reservoir System Operation Plan-Section 46-127(8); 
• §288.2(a)(1)(J)-Means of Implementing and Enforcement-Section 46-127(9), appendix B; 
• §288.2(a)(1)(K)-Coordination with Regional Water Planning Group-Section 46-127(10) and appendix D. 
(1)  Utility profile. Appendix C to this water conservation plan is a water utility profile for the City of Port Neches, based on the format recommended by the TCEQ. Table 3.1 summarizes key facts from the water utility profile. 
(2)  Specification of water conservation goals. Table 3.2 shows historical and projected per capita municipal water use for the city. Water use is shown in units of gallons per capita per day (gped). Per capita municipal water use is municipal water use divided by population. The per capita municipal water use includes industrial use. 
Projected per capita municipal uses were obtained from the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and interpolated to match the appropriate years for the five-year and ten-year goals. The TWDB projections are applicable for a dry year, in which outdoor water use would be high. Per capita municipal water use in a year with normal or high precipitation during the summer should be less than projected. 
(3)  Accurate metering of raw water supplies and treated water deliveries. Raw water and treated water pumpage for all customers of city, including public water supply, is metered. Each meter has an accuracy of plus or minus five percent. The raw water and finished water meters are calibrated annually by qualified personnel to meet the state requirements set by TCEQ. The meters are repaired or replaced as needed. 
(4)  Metering of customer and public uses and meter testing, repair and replacement. Water usage for all customers of city, not including public and governmental users, is metered. All meters in the city were replaced in 2005-2006 and were upgraded to a radio-read system. As part of water conservation, the city operates a meter replacement program that will replace every meter based on its usage identified life cycle. In addition, meters registering any unusual or questionable readings are tested and repaired to restore full functionality. 
(5)  Determination and control of unaccounted water. Unaccounted water is the difference between raw water drawn from the Lower Neches Valley Authority Canal and metered deliveries to customers. (This includes authorized but unmetered uses such as fire fighting and releases for flushing of lines). Unaccounted water can include several categories: 
• Inaccuracies in customer meters (customer meters tend to run more slowly as they age and under-report actual use). 
• Losses due to water main breaks and leaks in the water distribution system; 
• Losses due to illegal connections; 
• Firefighting; 
• System maintenance/line flushing. 
The city will conduct a water audit every five years using the format recommended by the Texas Water Development Board. The audit will divide water losses into apparent losses and real losses. Apparent water losses include water that was actually used, but not accounted for, such as customer meter errors or theft. Accounting for apparent losses increases the city's utility revenue, but does not reduce water usage. Real losses include leakage and overflows at the water treatment plant. Identifying and preventing real losses decreases a utility's costs and decrease water usage. The city will target real losses under this conservation strategy. 
As shown in appendix C, unaccounted water for the city has varied from seven percent to 20 percent in the last five years. With the measures described in this plan, the city intends to maintain the unaccounted water below 18 percent in 2020 and subsequent years. If unaccounted water exceeds this goal, the city will implement a more intensive audit to determine the source(s) of water loss and reduce the unaccounted water. 
(6)  Continuing public education and information campaign. The continuing public education and information campaign on water conservation for the City of Port Neches includes the following elements: 
• Promote the city's water conservation measures (presented in this section and sections 46-128 and 46-129); 
• Include information of water conservation on water bills, or on mailouts at least twice per year. Inserts will include material developed by city staff and material obtained from the TWDB, TCEQ, and other sources; 
• Encourage local media coverage of water conservation issues and the importance of water conservation; 
• Notify local organizations, schools, and civic groups that city staff is available to make presentations on the importance of water conservation and ways to save water; 
• Make water conservation brochures and other water conservation materials available to the public at the Port Neches Public Library and other public places; 
• Make information on water conservation available online at www.ci.port-neches.tx.us and will include links to information on water conservation on the TWDB and TCEQ websites. 
(7)  Nonpromotional water rate structure according to this section. The city uses an ascending rate structure to promote water conservation. (See table 3.3) 
(8)  Reservoir system operation plan. The city does not have a reservoir and, therefore, a reservoir system operation plan is not applicable. 
(9)  Implementation and enforcement of the water conservation plan. Appendix B contains a copy of the ordinance approved by Port Neches City Council adopting this water conservation plan. The ordinance designates responsible officials to implement and enforce the water conservation plan. 
(10)  Coordination with regional water planning group. Appendix D includes a copy of a letter sent to the chair of the Region I Water Planning Group with this water conservation plan. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(Exh. A, § 3), 5-7-2009) 
Sec. 46-128. - Additional required water conservation plan content. 
    The Texas Administrative Code also includes additional requirements for water conservation plans for public drinking water suppliers that serve a population of 5,000 people or more and/or a projected population of 5,000 people or more within the next ten years: 
• §288.2(a)(2)(A)-Leak Detection, Repair, and Water Loss Accounting-Sections 46-127(5) and 46-128(1); 
• §288.2(a)(2)(B)-Record Management System-Section 46-128(2); 
• §288.2(a)(2)(C)-Requirement for Water Conservation Plans by Wholesale Customers-Section 46-128(3). 
(1)  Leak detection and repair; pressure control. Measures to control unaccounted water are part of the routine operations of the city. Data from the radio-read system is used to find and report signs of illegal connections so they can be addressed quickly. Crews and personnel look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system. Maintenance crews respond quickly to repair leaks reported by the public and city personnel. The city spends $30,000.00 per year to repair and replace water distribution lines and uses two distribution line maintenance crews. Areas of the water distribution system in which numerous leaks and line breaks occur are targeted for replacement as funds are available. 
To reduce real water losses, the city will maintain a proactive water loss program. As part of this program, the city will implement the following actions: 
• Conduct regular inspections and soundings of water main fittings and connections; 
• Conduct intermittent night-flow measurements; 
• Reduce repair time on leaks by additional repair staff when needed; 
• Limit surges in pressure; 
• Reduce night-time pressure, where feasible, to reduce losses from background leaks; 
(2)  Record management system. As required by TAC title 30, part 1, chapter 288, subchapter A, rule 288.2(a)(2)(B), the record management system for the city records water pumped, water delivered, water sold, estimates for water losses, and allows for the separation of water sales and uses into residential and commercial categories. 
(Ord. No. 2009-10, § 1(Exh. A, § 4), 5-7-2009) 
Sec. 46-129. - Optional water conservation plan content. 
    TCEQ rules also list optional (not required) conservation strategies, which may be adopted by suppliers to achieve the stated goals of the plan. The following optional strategies are listed in the rules and included in this plan: 
• §288.2(a)(3)(A)-Conservation Oriented Water Rates-Section 46-127(7); 
• §288.2(a)(3)(B)-Ordinances, Plumbing Codes or Rules on Water-Conserving Fixtures-Section 46-129(1); 
(1)  Ordinances, plumbing codes, or rules on water-conserving fixtures. The state has required water-conserving fixtures in new construction and renovations since 1992. The state standards require flows of no more than 2.5 gallons per minute (gpm) for faucets, 3.0 gpm for showerheads, and 1.6 gallons per flush for toilets. Similar standards are also required under federal law. These state and federal standards assure that all new construction and renovations in the city will use water-conserving fixtures. 
In addition, federal rules requiring energy-conserving clothes washers by 2007 are expected to assure that new clothes washers in the city will be water-efficient.

(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 54-64(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted in subsections (a) through (f) of this section and the intent of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article (section 54-34). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Prerequisites for granting variances are as follows: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(j)  Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in section 54-65(a) through (i) are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

    In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 54-37, section 54-62(8), or section 54-83(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in section 54-64(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice, as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the city's FIRM on sites: 
(i)  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(ii)  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
(iii)  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or, 
(iv)  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred 'substantial damage' as a result of a flood, 
be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the city's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or, 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than three inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH and AE on the city's FIRM are required to either: 
(i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
(ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
(iii)  Meet the permit requirements of subsection 54-64(a) and the elevation and anchoring requirements for 'manufactured homes' in paragraph (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.

Sec. 54-84. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-37 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow, therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's flood insurance rate map (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's flood insurance rate map (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 54-64(a)(1), are satisfied. 
(4)  Within zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes, to guide floodwater around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 1987-22, art. V, § D, 11-19-1987) 
Sec. 54-85. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this article by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction, be subject to penalties as prescribed by state law for each violation and, in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(1)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a service retirement annuity if the member has at least 25 years of credited service in that system performed for one or more municipalities that have participation dates after September 1, 1987, or have adopted a like provision under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.202(f). 
(2)  If a member described in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.204(b) shall die before becoming eligible for service retirement and leaves surviving a lawful spouse whom the member has designated as beneficiary entitled to payment of the member's accumulated contributions in the event of the member's death before retirement, the surviving spouse may, by written notice filed with the system, elect to leave the accumulated deposits on deposit with the system subject to the terms and conditions of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.204. If the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse in the amount that would have been payable to the surviving spouse had the member lived and retired at that date under an optional annuity described by V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.104(c)(1). 
(3)  At any time before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity, a surviving spouse to whom subsection (2) of this section applies may, upon written application filed with the system, receive payment of the accumulated contributions standing to the account of the member in lieu of any benefits otherwise payable under this section. If such a surviving spouse shall die before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section, the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be paid to the estate of such spouse. 
(4)  The rights, credits and benefits authorized in subsections (1) through (3) of this section shall be in addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force on December 1, 1987, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Government Code ch. 851 et seq. 
(5)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a standard occupational disability retirement annuity under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.408, or an optional occupational disability retirement annuity under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.410, upon making application therefor upon such form and in such manner as may be prescribed by the board of trustees of the system, provided that the system's medical board has certified to the board of trustees that: 
a.  The member is physically or mentally disabled for further performance of the duties of the member's employment; 
b.  The disability is likely to be permanent; and 
c.  The member should be retired. 
Any annuity granted under this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.409.

(a)  On the terms and conditions set out in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.305, as amended, each member of the Texas Municipal Retirement System who is now or who hereafter becomes an employee of this city shall receive restricted prior service credit for service previously performed as any of any of the entities described in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.305, provided that the person does not otherwise have credited service in the system for that service, and the service meets the requirements of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.305. 
(b)  The service credit granted by this section may be used only to satisfy length-of-service requirements for retirement eligibility, has no monetary value in computing the annuity payments allowable to the member, and may not be used in other computations, including computation of updated service credits. 
(c)  A member seeking to established restricted prior service credit under this section must take the action required under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.305, while still an employee of this city. 
(Code 1962, § 2-4.10; Ord. No. 1997-02, § 7, 2-6-1997) 
Sec. 86-113. - Optional benefit for designated beneficiary of vested employee. 
(a)  If a member who has sufficient credited service performed for municipalities that have adopted or are subject to this section to entitle the member to withdraw from service, to leave on deposit with the retirement system the member's accumulated contributions and, on attainment of an age prescribed by this subtitle, to retire with a service retirement benefit, dies before becoming eligible for service retirement and leaves as surviving a person whom the member has designated as beneficiary entitled to payment of the member's accumulated contributions in the event of the member's death before retirement, the person may by written notice filed with the board elect to leave the accumulated deposits with the retirement system subject to the terms of this section. If the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the person designated as beneficiary may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly during the lifetime of the person in the amount that would have been payable to the person had the member lived and retired at that date under an optional annuity described by V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.104(c)(1). 
(b)  At any time before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity, a designated beneficiary to whom this section applies may, after filing a written application with the board of trustees, receive payment of the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member in lieu of any benefits otherwise payable under this section. If the designated beneficiary dies before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section, the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be paid to the estate of the designated beneficiary. 
(c)  A person eligible to file an election under subsection (b) of this section may, by written notice filed with the board of trustees not later than 180 days after the date of the member's death, elect to receive a reduced annuity under this subsection instead of the accumulated deposits or the annuity under subsection (b) of this section. An annuity under this subsection is payable monthly during the person's lifetime in the amount that would have been payable to the person if the member had been eligible to retire and had retired, on the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which death occurred, under an optional annuity described by V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.104(c)(1). 
(d)  If a member to whom this section applies has designated as beneficiary a person to whom a retirement plan that is qualified under section 401, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, cannot make payments for a period greater than five years after the date of the member's death without losing its qualified status and the beneficiary elects to receive an annuity under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the annuity payable by the retirement system is the actuarial equivalent of the monthly payments that the beneficiary would have received if the member had retired on the date the annuity begins under the optional annuity described by V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.104(c)(1), to be paid over 60 months. 
(e)  If a member to whom this section applies has designated more than one person as beneficiaries and those persons elect to receive an annuity under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the annuity payable by the retirement system is the actuarial equivalent of the monthly payments that the beneficiaries would have received if the member had retired on the date the annuity begins under the optional annuity described by V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.104(c)(4), to be paid over 180 months. 
(f)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a standard occupational disability retirement annuity under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.408, or an optional occupational disability retirement annuity under V.C.T.A., Government Code § 854.410, upon making application therefor upon such form and in such manner as may be prescribed by the board of trustees of the system, provided that the system's medical board has certified to the board of trustees that: 
(1)  The member is physically or mentally disabled for further performance of the duties of the member's employment; 
(2)  The disability is likely to be permanent; and 
(3)  The member should be retired. 
Any annuity granted under this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of V.C.T.A., Government Code § 854.409. 
(g)  The provisions relating to the occupational disability program as set forth in subsection (f) of this section are in lieu of the disability program heretofore provided for under V.C.T.A., Government Code §§ 854.301-854.308.

(c)  [Reduction.] An increase in an annuity that was reduced because of an option selection is reducible in the same proportion and in the same manner that the original annuity was reduced. 
(d)  [When no change indicated.] If a computation hereunder does not result in an increase in the amount of an annuity, the amount of the annuity will not be changed hereunder. 
(e)  [Obligation of city.] The amount by which an increase under this section exceeds all previously granted increases to an annuitant is an obligation of the city and of its account in the municipality accumulation fund of the system. 
(f)  Effective date. Subject to approval by the board of trustees of the system, this section shall be and become effective on the first day of January 2011.

Sec. 114-62. - Discharge of wastewater on public property; discharge of water originating from private system; infiltration/inflow policy. 
(a)  Discharge of wastewater on public property. The discharge of any wastewater or sewage of any kind, excepting only rainwater or the flow from natural streams, upon or across any public property, streets, alleys or dedicated rights-of-way is prohibited. 
(b)  Discharge of water from private system. It shall be unlawful to discharge wastewater originating from private sources, such as wells or privately owned water systems, into the city's sanitary sewage system. 
(c)  Infiltration/inflow policy. There is hereby established the following policy regarding the infiltration/inflow of rainwater into the sanitary sewer collection system of the city: 
(1)  It is strictly prohibited for any person to open his sewer line for the purpose of using the sewer line to dispose of rainwater, or water from flowing streams, or water collected into ponds. If such use is discovered by the city, it will result in immediate disconnection of the consumer from both the water and the sewer systems of the city, and reconnection will not be made until such time that the matter has been corrected to the satisfaction of the director of public works and payment has been made of charges for the new water and sewer taps and all related charges. 
(2)  Should a private sewer line be defective to the extent that it allows surface water from any source to infiltrate the sewer system, the city shall, upon discovery of such condition, notify such person of the defective service line and give such person 60 days in which to correct the problem. If, after such period of time has elapsed, the property owner has not repaired the defective service line and had such repairs inspected by an agent of the city, the city will institute a charge in the amount of $15.63 to cover the cost of treating the surface water that has been allowed to escape into the city's sewer system by way of the defective line. Such charge will be added to the customer's monthly water, sewer and garbage bill for each and every month such line remains defective. This charge will remain in effect on the customer's monthly bill until the property owner corrects the problem with the defective service line and contacts the city for an inspection of the repairs. When the city inspector approves the repair or line replacement, then the charge shall be thenceforth removed from the customer's bill. Failure to pay the monthly charge will carry the same penalties as normal water, sewer and garbage fees. 
(d)  Any violation of any of this section shall result in the immediate disconnection of the consumer from both the water and sewer system of the city, and reconnection will not be made until such time that the matter has been corrected to the satisfaction of the director of public works and payment has been made of the charges for new water and sewer taps and all related charges.

Sec. 114-63. - Sewer adjustments to utility bill. 
(a)  The city manager and/or his/her designee shall be authorized to make credit adjustments on the sewer charges of a utility bill when a documented water break has caused an above average consumption of water. No adjustments shall be made for leaking toilets, faucets left running or filling swimming pools. The customer must provide proof of repairs before an adjustment will be made. 
(b)  Adjustments to the sewer charges shall be for no more than two water bills. The adjustment shall be made based upon an average of the prior 12 months of service. If the customer has not had service for 12 months, a minimum period of three months can be used for the purpose of determining an average bill. If the customer has not had service for three months, an adjustment will not be made until three months of service has occurred after the repair has been made. 
(c)  In no case shall a sewer adjustment be granted if the city notified the customer of a potential water leak on his/her property and repair is not timely made. 
(d)  Sewer adjustments are limited to one per 12-month period.

(b)  However, should the driver of the vehicle be incapacitated and the officer not be able to promptly locate a person who has sufficient authority for the care of the vehicle, then the officer may, if it appears necessary and in such officer's judgment, order the removal of the vehicle to a place of safety for the benefit of the driver or owner of the vehicle. Charges for service or storage in such cases will be the responsibility of the owner. 
(c)  In any instance where the driver or owner of the vehicle does not have a preference and requests the officer to call a wrecker or if the driver is incapacitated as described in subsection (b), the officer will call central dispatch and request that the next towing company listed on the nonpreference list be called to move the vehicle to safety. The nonpreference list will be maintained by the police chief and it shall include only permitees that have obtained permits in compliance with this article. 
(Code 1962, § 23A-10; Ord. No. 1988-03, § 1, 5-9-1988; Ord. No. 2008-11, § V, 9-4-2008) 
Sec. 118-138. - Nonpreference rotation system; charges for towing and storage. 
(a)  The nonpreference rotation system has been established as a means of securing immediate wrecker service in cases of emergency relating to accidents on the public streets, abandoned vehicles on the public streets and other circumstances of public necessity arising out of law enforcement. The nonpreference rotation system, therefore, is subject to the governance of the police department in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  The police department shall maintain a list of participating vehicle storage facilities that hold a city permit. If owners/operators of disabled vehicles need towing company service but have no preference of towing companies or are unavailable to request a particular towing company, the police department will call participating vehicle storage facilities on a rotating basis until contact is made with a company that can perform the desired service. 
(c)  Police officers are empowered in exigent circumstances to select available tow trucks without regard to the rotation lists maintained by the police department. If a tow truck is utilized in the manner described in this subsection, that particular service will be charged to the towing company's next rotation turn. 
(d)  When a driver or owner of a vehicle to be towed away indicates or requests a particular towing company, the officer on the scene shall notify the communications dispatcher to summon that company by request. Any requested tow truck must be one that has obtained all necessary permits under this article. 
(e)  If the driver or owner of a vehicle to be towed expresses no preference as to wrecker service or for any reason cannot be questioned as to a preference, the officer on the scene shall notify the communications dispatcher to summon the vehicle storage facility whose name appears at the top of the nonpreference rotation list. All vehicles that need to be towed incidental to an arrest will be considered a nonpreference tow. 
(f)  Upon accepting a summons from the communications dispatcher, a towing company shall be allowed a maximum of 20 minutes to appear on the scene. If the company does not appear on the scene within such a time limit, its call may be canceled, its name placed on the bottom of the list and the next towing company on the list will be called. 
(g)  Towing companies participating in the nonpreference rotation system are also required to comply with the following: 
(1)  The participating vehicle storage facility permit holder is responsible for the actions of tow truck drivers and employees or anyone acting on behalf of the company. 
(2)  Vehicle storage facility owners, drivers and employees, or anyone acting in their behalf, must fully comply with all state laws and local ordinances. 
(3)  A vehicle storage facility called to perform service shall be required to perform such service in a tow truck that has a tow truck permit in its name. 
(4)  A tow truck business cannot refuse to respond to a call from the police department and perform the requested service unless its tow trucks are all incapacitated or otherwise unavailable due to another bona fide engagement for their service. 
(5)  Towing companies are required to be on call for summons by the police department 24 hours a day, including weekends and holidays. Repeated failure to respond to such summons shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this provision; such violation, however, is subject only to administrative action, which may be taken by the chief of police. 
(6)  Fees charged shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Fees charged by towing companies for nonpreference rotation tows, pickups or related towing service shall not exceed the following: 
1.  To remove any vehicle from any public or private property to any storage area or destination within the city by a standard tow truck, a basic fee may be charged not to exceed the following:

3.  To remove any vehicle from a canal, river, lake or waterway and transport to any storage area or destination within the city by a tow truck, an additional fee of $50.00 may be charged as well as costs for the actual cost of diver services. 
4.  When any standard or heavy-duty tow truck is called for towing service and is unable to perform the required service and has need of an additional tow truck to perform such service, upon prior approval by the police officer on the scene, the towing company initially summoned shall be allowed to select and employ an additional tow truck to assist in performing the required service. The additional tow truck so employed shall be one that is permitted under this article to engage in the towing business in the city, if possible. The basic fee for the additional tow truck shall be the same as the first. 
5.  A fee for storage of a vehicle shall not exceed the following and shall not be charged during the first 24 hours such vehicle is in the storage facility: 
Inside building, per day: $15.00 
Covered storage, per day: $10.00 
Storage in fenced yard, per day: $8.00 
b.  Fees established in this section with respect to nonpreference towing calls are inclusive. Additional fees for initial services are prohibited. This restriction does not apply to additional fees charged for subsequent services later requested by the vehicle owner or such owner's agent(s).

The regulations are necessary to encourage the most appropriate use of land; to reduce fire hazards and to improve public safety; to decrease traffic congestion and its accompanying hazards; to prevent the undue concentration of population; to lay a proper foundation for the reasonable termination of land use activities which are not in conformance with the city's long-range land use plans; to create a comprehensive and stable pattern of land uses; to maintain and stabilize property values; to develop an efficient and effective basis upon which to provide services for water supply, sanitary and storm sewer systems, pedestrian and automobile circulation, schools, parks, and other public facilities; and to provide for effective redevelopment of existing uses. 
    Within the zones or districts, the city may restrict and regulate the location, erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence and other specified uses; regulate the intensity of the use of lot areas, and regulate and determine the area of open spaces surrounding such uses; establish building lines and locations of buildings designed for specified industrial, business, residential and other uses within such areas, set standards to which buildings or structures shall conform; prohibit uses, set performance standards or prohibit buildings or structures incompatible with the characteristics of such districts; prevent additions to and alterations or remodeling of existing buildings or structures in such a way as to avoid the restrictions and limitations lawfully imposed hereunder; and provide for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses of land, buildings and structure.

Sec. 126.1.4. - Relationship to the city comprehensive plan. 
    The regulations contained herein have been developed in accordance with a comprehensive land use planning program for the orderly growth and development of the city, both within the current city limit, and in the legal extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. While it is recognized that this chapter is not valid outside the city limit, it is appropriate to make future planning decisions based on proposed land uses outside the city limit but within the legal extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. This chapter has been designed to incorporate and implement the goals, objectives, and policies found in the document titled Community Development Strategy for Port Neches (dated November 2001), including the community development concept contained therein, which is officially adopted as the long range plan for the city.

Sec. 126.3.1. - Provisions for official zoning map. 
    Official zoning map. There shall be a map known and designated as the official city zoning map, which shall show the boundaries of all zoning districts within the city's planning jurisdiction. This map shall be drawn on acetate or other durable material from which prints can be made, shall be dated, and shall be kept in a place under the direction and approval of the city secretary. The city may authorize digital copies of the official city zoning map with the notice that the only official city zoning map is kept by the city secretary. The official city zoning map which, together with all explanatory material thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. 
    Changes to be entered. If changes are made in the district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official city zoning map, such changes shall be entered on the official city zoning map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the city council. No amendment to this chapter shall become effective until after change and entry has been made on said map. 
    Identification of changes made. Approved zoning changes shall be entered on the official city zoning map by the building official under the direction of the city secretary, and each change shall be identified on the map with the date and number of the ordinance making the change. 
    Unauthorized changes prohibited. No change of any nature shall be made on the official city zoning map that is not in accordance with this section and chapter. 
    To be the final authority. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official city zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the official city zoning map, which shall be located in a place under the direction and approval of the city secretary, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings and other structures in the city. The official city zoning map shall be available to the public at all hours when the city hall is open to the public. 
    Replacement. Should the official city zoning map be lost, destroyed, or damaged, the building official may have a new map drawn on acetate or other durable material from which prints can be made. No further city council authorization or action is required so long as no district boundaries are changed. The latest date of the revision shall be added and the replacement map will supersede any older version. The new official city zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official city zoning map, but no such corrections shall have the effect of amending the original official city zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. 
    Prior map records. Unless the prior official city zoning map has been lost or has been totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. These copies shall be kept in a location under the direction of the city secretary. 
( Ord. No. 2015-03, § II, 3-12-2015 ) 
Sec. 126.3.2. - Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. 
    Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official city zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(a)  Boundaries shall be construed as the centerline of existing, future, or vacated streets, highways, railroads, alleys, or irrigation canals or other public rights-of-way; or 
(b)  Where property has been subdivided into block and lot, the boundaries shall be construed to be the lot line; or 
(c)  Where a lot or parcel of land (designated by metes and bounds instead of a lot as in the case of a subdivision) is split by zoning, the less-restricted zoning shall prevail for the entire lot; or 
(d)  Where property is not otherwise designated, divided, or subdivided, the boundary line shall be determined by the scaled distance shown on the official city zoning map; or 
(e)  Where, due to the scale, lack of detail, or illegibility of the official city zoning map, there is any uncertainty, contradiction, or conflict as to the intended location of any district boundaries shown thereon, interpretation concerning the exact location of a zone district boundary line shall, upon a written request submitted to the building official, be determined by the zoning board of adjustment. The zoning board of adjustment is authorized to interpret the zoning map and rule upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary lines and similar questions. An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to the zoning board of adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the building official. The application shall contain sufficient information to enable the zoning board of adjustment to make the necessary interpretation; or 
(f)  Where the zoning board of adjustment is unable to determine the location of a district boundary, the city council shall have the final decision and shall apply the designations shown in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the official city zoning map for the particular area in question.

    126.4.14.1. Policy. The old downtown historic area, along with other areas, has been a significant part of the development of the city. The city council realizes the importance of preserving theses historical areas as well as other historical places in the city. The city council hereby finds and declares as a matter of public policy that the protection, enhancement, preservation and use of historic places and areas are a public necessity. 
    126.4.14.2. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and: 
(a)  To protect, enhance and perpetuate places and areas which represent distinctive and important elements of the city's historical, cultural, archeological, political and architectural history; 
(b)  To promote tourism and strengthen the economy of the city; 
(c)  To foster civic pride and promote the enjoyment and use of historic resources by the city's residents; 
(d)  To preserve and enhance the beauty of historic areas; and to provide for new development in historic districts that is consistent with the existing historic structures. 
    126.4.14.3. Initiation of review. After determining that there is considerable interest among its membership or citizenry in designating a place or area as a historic district, the city council shall vote on whether or not to initiate a review to consider establishment of a historic overlay district. During this review period, which shall not last longer than 60 days, no building permit shall be issued for proposed work to the exterior of the affected property(ies) nor shall the affected property(ies) be demolished or removed. The city council shall provide notice of and conduct public hearings as provided in this chapter to consider the historical overlay district designation. 
    126.4.14.4. Criteria for establishment of districts. The city council may consult with experts in deciding whether to establish a historic overlay district. In making such a decision, the city council shall consider if the place or area has one or more of the following characteristics: 
(a)  Recognition as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, a National Historic Landmark, or entry on the National Register of Historic Places; 
(b)  Location as the site of a significant historic event; 
(c)  Identification with a person or persons who significantly contributed to the culture and development of the city, state or country; 
(d)  Embodiment of elements of architectural design, detail, materials, or craftsmanship that represent a significant architectural innovation;

(k)  Value as an aspect of community sentiment or public pride. 
    126.4.14.5. Establishment of districts. After notice and public hearing as required by law, the city council may establish a historic overlay district to preserve places and areas of historical, architectural, archeological, or cultural importance or value. These places and areas will be designated by "HP" on the official zoning map. At the time of establishing a specific historic district, the city council may impose additional regulations upon the district to preserve its historic value and fulfill any other purposes of the district. 
    An overlay district is "overlaid" upon other districts, and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying district only if such use is also permitted in the applicable overlay district. For any property in an overlay district, then, the regulations of both the overlay district and the underlying zoning district apply. In the case of conflict between the regulations of the underlying and overlay district, the most restrictive regulations take precedence. 
    126.4.14.6. Certificate of appropriateness. The building official shall issue no building permit for proposed work to the exterior of a structure in a historic overlay district or for new construction in a historic overlay district unless the planning and zoning commission has issued a certificate of appropriateness to the property owner. 
    When applying for such a permit, the applicant shall forward three copies of all detailed plans, elevations, perspectives, specifications and other documents pertaining to the work, to the building official, who shall forward one copy to the planning and zoning commission within five days of receipt thereof. 
    Upon review of the application, the planning and zoning commission shall determine, based on guidelines set by the city council, whether the proposed work is of a nature which will adversely affect any historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural feature of the historic structure, and whether such work is appropriate and consistent with the spirit and intent of this section and the ordinance establishing the historic overlay district. The planning and zoning commission shall deny or approve a certificate of appropriateness and forward such action to the building official within 30 days of receiving the application. The building official shall immediately notify the applicant of the planning and zoning commission's action. Upon request of the property owner, the city council may elect to entertain an appeal of the decision. In such case, upon appropriate notice being given and a public hearing being held, the city council may elect to uphold the denial of a certificate of appropriateness or overturn it. 
    126.4.14.7. Demolition or removal. If the building official receives an application for demolition or removal of any structure in a historic overlay district, the planning and zoning commission shall hold a hearing within 30 days after the application is filed. The planning and zoning commission shall hear all interested parties. The planning and zoning commission shall consider the state of repair of the structure, the reasonableness of the cost of restoration or repair, taking into account the purpose of preserving the historic structure, the character of the historic area, and all other factors that it finds appropriate. Based on these factors, the planning and zoning commission may determine that, in the interest of preserving historical value, the structure should not be demolished, and in that event, the application shall be denied. Upon request of the property owner, the city council may elect to entertain an appeal of the decision. In such case, upon appropriate notice being given and a public hearing being held, the city council may elect to uphold the application denial or overturn it. 
    126.4.14.8. Penalties. It shall be unlawful to construct, reconstruct, structurally alter, remodel, renovate, restore, demolish, raze, or maintain any structure in a historic overlay district in violation of the provisions of this section.

Sec. 126.4.16. - BC Business Corridor Overlay district. 
    126.4.16.1. Policy. The city council recognizes the long-term impact of commercial/retail development along certain established commercial roadway corridors and the lack of a cohesive, planned pedestrian-oriented environment in those areas, the efficient utilization thereof, and to the viability and diversification of the commercial/retail development of the city. The city council has recognized the potential positive impact for a higher-quality redevelopment of certain commercial/retail areas within the city that would provide for maximizing the potential to enhance the pedestrian shopping experience and improve the quality of life for the citizens and visitors of the city and to improve and enhance the utilization of the commercial/retail areas for economic development purposes. As a first step to realization of this goal, city council declares as a matter of public policy that the enhanced pedestrian use of commercial/retail development within certain commercial/retail roadway corridors and the visual aesthetic improvement of gateway entrances into the city is a public necessity. 
    126.4.16.2. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and:

ARTICLE 126.6. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 126.6.1. - Conditional use permits. 
    126.6.1.1. Purpose. This section provides the city council the opportunity to deny or to conditionally approve those uses for which conditional use permits are required as indicated as conditional uses in each zoning district. These uses generally have unusual nuisance characteristics or are of a public or semipublic character often essential or desirable for the general convenience and welfare of the community. Because, however, of the nature of the use, the importance of the use's relationship to the comprehensive plan, or possible adverse impact on neighboring properties of the use, review, evaluation and exercise of planning judgment relative to the location and site plan of the proposed use are required. 
    126.6.1.2. Permits required. A building permit or certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for any use to be located in a zoning district which permits that use only as a conditional use unless a conditional use permit has first been issued in accordance with the provisions of this section with the exception of a structure and/or use allowed to continue as a nonconformity as described in section 126.6.5. 
    126.6.1.3. Application procedure. An application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the building official. Upon receipt of an application, the public hearing and notification procedures prescribed in subsection 126.6.2.3 shall be followed. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan, which, along with the application, will become part of the conditional use permit, if approved. The accompanying site plan shall provide the following minimum information: 
(a)  Data describing all processes and activities involved with the proposed use; 
(b)  Boundaries of the area covered by the site plan; 
(c)  The location of each existing and proposed building and structure in, the area covered by the site plan and the number of stories, height, roofline, gross floor area and location of building entrances and exits;

Sec. 126.6.2. - Planning and zoning commission (P&Z). 
    126.6.2.1. Purpose. The planning and zoning commission has been established for the purpose of preparing, updating and implementing a comprehensive plan or other specific plans through various means such as zoning, subdivision, annexation, and other related techniques. The city council shall have final authority on all conditional use permits, subdivisions, replats, and modification of zoning district boundaries. 
    126.6.2.2. Application procedures. Application for all zoning district changes, conditional use permits, annexations, initial zonings and zoning text amendments shall be submitted to the city council. Any landowner or governmental agency may submit an application. 
    126.6.2.3. Public hearing and notice requirements. Upon receiving an application for a zoning district change, zoning text amendment, future land use plan change, conditional use permit, or initial zoning, City staff shall review the application for conformance with applicable requirements. When notice is required by the V.T.C.A. Local Government Code, § 211.006 or by any other provisions of the Texas Local Government Code prior to a public hearing being held by the city council or the planning and zoning commission regarding zoning regulations and/or zoning district boundaries, city staff may prescribe the type of notice to be given of the date and time and place of a public hearing by the city council and/or the planning and zoning commission. Upon completion of the review of an application, city staff shall schedule a public hearing with the planning and zoning commission and shall provide written notice of the public hearing to the applicant and to all persons who own property within 200 feet of the proposed property. Such notice shall be given not less than ten days before the date set for the public hearing by depositing in the mail such notice, properly addressed and postage paid, to each taxpayer as the ownership appears on the last approved city tax roll. A notice of the public hearing shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. Such notice shall state the time, place, and nature of such public hearing and such public hearing shall not be held earlier than 15 days from the date of publication of the notice. Concurrently with the scheduling of the public hearing for the planning and zoning commission, city staff shall also schedule a public hearing for the city council in accordance with the same notification procedures prescribed for the public hearing by the planning and zoning commission. At their meeting at which the public hearing is conducted, the planning and zoning commission, subsequent to the public hearing, shall make a recommendation regarding the application that will be forwarded to the city council. The city council, at their meeting at which a public hearing has been scheduled, shall conduct a public hearing to consider the application and the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission; subsequent to the public hearing, the city council shall make a determination as to whether to approve or deny the application request. The city council has final approval authority and may use the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission to determine whether to approve or deny the application request. If there is a protest filed with the city secretary against such proposed amendment, supplement or change, duly signed by the owners of 20 percent, or more, either of the lots or land included in the proposed change or of the lots or land immediately adjoining the same and extending 200 feet therefrom, such proposed amendment, supplement or change shall not become effective except by a four-fifths vote of all of the members of the city council. 
    126.6.2.4. Resubmittal of application. An application for a zoning district change or conditional use permit shall not be resubmitted or reconsidered for a period of one year after it has been denied by the city council, except application may be made for a different zoning district change or conditional use permit for the same property six months after such a previous action has been taken. In addition, any reapplication for a different zoning district change or conditional use permit shall be permitted if an additional double fee is charged. 
    126.6.2.5. Annual report required. On or before the first day of February of each year, the planning and zoning commission shall produce and disseminate to the city council and the citizens of the city, a report on the activities of the commission during the past year. Said report shall include, but shall not be limited to: 
(a)  The status of the city's comprehensive plan, including activities directly related to the implementation of the plan; 
(b)  The number, nature, location, and record of approvals/denials of requests for amendments to the zoning ordinance text and map; 
(c)  The number, nature, location, and record of approvals/denials of requests for conditional use permits; and 
(d)  The number, nature, location, recommendations and record of approvals/denials of requests for subdivision plats.

Sec. 126.6.3. - Zoning board of adjustment (ZBA). 
    126.6.3.1. Establishment. A zoning board of adjustment has been established in accordance with the provisions of V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.008, regarding the zoning of cities and with the powers and duties as provided in said code. The board of adjustment, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, is authorized to make special exceptions to the terms of this chapter that are consistent with the general purpose and intent of the chapter and in accordance with any applicable rules contained in the chapter. 
    The zoning board of adjustment shall consist of five members, each to be appointed by the city council for a term of two years and removable for cause by the appointing authority upon written charges and after public hearing. Vacancies will be filled for the unexpired term of any member, whose place becomes vacant for any cause, in the same manner as the original appointment was made. Three members shall serve until January 1 of odd-numbered years, as heretofore appointed, and two members, as heretofore appointed, will serve until January 1 of even-numbered years, and thereafter each member reappointed or each new appointee will serve for a full term of two years unless removed as hereinabove provided. The city council may also appoint four alternate members of the board who will serve in the absence of one or more of the regular members when requested to do so by the chairman of the board, so that all cases to be heard by the board will always be heard by a minimum number of four members. These alternate members, when appointed, will serve for the same period as the regular members, for a term of two years, and any vacancy will be filled in the same manner and they will be subject to removal by the same means and under the same procedures as the regular members. 
    126.6.3.2. Hearings. The hearings of the board will be public. Public notice will be given, including mail notice to all identified parties and interests listed below, no less than ten days before the hearing. The board will hear the testimony of any owner of property adjacent to, in the rear of, across the street, or within 200 feet from a lot as to which the granting of any permit is pending, and will also hear any other parties that are on the current tax rolls of the city. All hearings are to be heard by at least four members of the board. 
    126.6.3.3. Meetings. Regular meetings of the board will be held at such times as the board may determine. Special meetings of the board will be held at the call of the chairman or at the written request of two regular members of the board; said request to be submitted to the chairman. 
    126.6.3.4. Rules and regulations. The board will keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and will keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which will be immediately filed in the office of the board and will be public record. The board shall act by resolution in which four members must concur. The board will adopt from time to time such additional rules and regulations as it may deem necessary to carry into effect the provisions of the chapter, and will furnish a copy of the same to the zoning administrator and the building inspector, all of which rules and regulations will operate uniformly in all cases. All of its resolutions and orders will be in accordance therewith. 
    Each member of the board will attend no less than 75 percent of the regular meetings called by the officers of the board. The secretary of the board will make a quarterly report to the mayor and city council showing the attendance of each member of the board. Any representative failing to attend 75 percent of the regular meetings legally called during any calendar year without an excused absence, as determined by a majority vote of the board members, may be disqualified for service on the board and shall be replaced with a new board member by vote of the city council. Should any member of the board move from the city or otherwise become disqualified for any reason, he/she will be deemed to have vacated the office. 
    There shall be no limit on the number of terms a member may serve, provided the member is reappointed by the city council. 
    126.6.3.5. Powers and duties. The board will have the power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error of law in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the building official of the city, or the planning and zoning commission, in the enforcement of this chapter. 
    It is the intent of this article that all questions of interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the building official. Then, such questions shall be presented to the Board only on appeal from the decision of the building official. 
    The concurring vote of four members of the board is necessary to: 
(a)  Reverse an order, requirement, decision or determination of the building official; 
(b)  Decide in favor of an applicant on a matter on which the board is required to pass; or 
(c)  Authorize a variation from the terms of a zoning ordinance. 
    126.6.3.6. Procedure. Appeals may be taken to and before the zoning board of adjustment by any person aggrieved, or by any officer, department, board or bureau in the city. Such appeal shall be made by filing with the office of the board a notice of appeal and specifying the grounds thereof. An appeal requesting a variance to any front yard, side yard, and/or rear yard setback requirements shall only be accepted in conjunction with the submission of construction plans for a structure(s) on the lot for which such a variance is being requested. The office or department from which the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
    An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the building official shall certify to the zoning board of adjustment that, by reason of facts in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted or by a court of equity, after notice to the office from whom the appeal is taken. 
    The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it, and shall mail notices of such hearing to the petitioner and to the owners of property lying within 200 feet of any point of the lot or portion thereof on which a variation is desired, and to all other persons deemed by the board to be affected thereby, such owners and persons being determined according to the current tax rolls of the city. Depositing of such written notice in the mail shall be deemed sufficient compliance therewith. 
    The board shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm wholly or partly or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination as in its opinion ought to be made in the premises, and to that end, shall have all powers of the officer or department from whom the appeal is taken. 
    Recourse from the decisions of the zoning board of adjustment shall be to the courts as provided by the laws of the state. 
    126.6.3.7. Reapplications. When the board has denied a proposal no new applications of similar nature for the same lot shall be accepted by the board or scheduled for 12 months after the date of board denial. Applications that have been withdrawn at or before the board meeting, or board action thereon, may be resubmitted at any time for hearing before the board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection 126.6.3.3 and payment of all applicable and required fees. 
    126.6.3.8. Changes. The board shall have no authority to change any provisions of this chapter and its jurisdiction is limited to hardship cases that may arise from time to time. The board may not change the district designation of any land either to a more or less restrictive zone. 
    126.6.3.9. Annual report required. On or before the first day of February of each year, the zoning board of adjustment shall produce and disseminate to the city council and the citizens of the city a report on the activities of the commission during the past year. Said report shall include, but shall not be limited to: 
(a)  The number, nature, location, and record of approvals/denials of requests for zoning ordinance text and map interpretations; 
(b)  The number, nature, location, and record of approvals/denials of requests for variances; and 
(c)  The number, nature, location, and record of approvals/denials of recommended requests for subdivision plats. 
( Ord. No. 2015-03, § II, 3-12-2015 ) 
Sec. 126.6.4. - Variances. 
    126.6.4.1. Powers. The board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done, including the following: 
(a)  Permit a variance in the yard requirements of any district where there are unusual and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of the provisions due to an irregular shape of the lot or topographical or other conditions provided such variance will not seriously affect any adjoining property or the general welfare; 
(b)  Authorize, upon appeal, whenever a property owner can show that a strict application of the terms of this chapter relating to the construction or alterations of buildings or structures will impose upon him unusual and practical difficulties or particular hardship, such variances from the strict application of the terms of this chapter as are in harmony with its own general purpose and intent, but only when the board is satisfied that granting of such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship, or difficulty so great as to warrant a variance from the comprehensive plan as established by this chapter and at the same time, the surrounding property will be properly protected; and 
(c)  Carry out all duties assigned to it in the section on nonconformities, below. 
( Ord. No. 2015-03, § II, 3-12-2015 ) 
Sec. 126.6.5. - Nonconformities. 
    126.6.5.1. Nonconforming lots, structures, uses and characteristics of uses. Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted there exist: 
(a)  Lots; 
(b)  Structure; 
(c)  Uses of land and structures; or 
(d)  Characteristics of use; 
which were lawful before the effective date of this chapter, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed or comply with the terms of this chapter but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. It is not the intent of this chapter to authorize, and this chapter shall not be construed to authorize, uses that constitute public or private nuisances or are otherwise prohibited by law or regulations. 
    Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with, or not within the meaning of, permitted uses in the district in which they are located. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter by attachment or additions on a building or premises or by placement of additional signs intended to be seen from off premises or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would not be permitted generally in the district involved. To be considered legally nonconforming, all nonconforming lots, structures and uses must apply for a certificate of occupancy indicating a nonconforming status within 90 days of the effective date of this chapter. 
    126.6.5.2. Construction activities. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently according to the city's building official and within the timeframe outline in the required permits. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation, demolition, or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation, demolition, or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently as determined by the city's building official. 
    126.6.5.3. Nonconforming lots of record. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record as of the effective date of this chapter. Such lots must be in separate ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements for the area, width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area, width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the board of adjustment. 
    If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter. 
    126.6.5.4. Continuance of nonconformities. After the effective date of this chapter, the nonconformity may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, on to or with the same lot, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located; 
(b)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(c)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed; 
(d)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year period (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; 
(e)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction; 
(f)  An existing structure and/or use permitted in a district for which a conditional use permit is later required by this chapter or its amendments shall be allowed to continue in accordance with section 126.1.10. No structure and/or use allowed to continue as a nonconformity shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered without applying for and receiving a conditional permit for the portion of the building and/or use being enlarged or altered. 
    126.6.5.5. Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure, or conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on repairs to an extent not exceeding 25 percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or portion of the structure, provided that the enclosed area existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased and there are no structural alterations. 
    126.6.5.6. Other uses not nonconforming uses. Any use which is permitted as a conditional use or previously receiving a valid variance, prior to the effective date of this chapter and in compliance with all requirements of this chapter shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use. 
    126.6.5.7. Addition of third electric meter deemed nonconforming use. The addition of a third electric meter to an accessory structure or accessory building or to a principal structure but used by an accessory structure or accessory building within any residential district shall deem the principal and accessory structure as nonconforming and will require the electric meter serving the accessory structure or accessory building to be removed. 
( Ord. No. 2015-03, § II, 3-12-2015 ) 
Sec. 126.6.6. - Building permits and certificates of occupancy. 
    126.6.6.1. Building permits required. No building or other structure shall be erected, moved, added to, or structurally altered without a permit issued by the building official in accordance with the provisions of the city Charter. No building permit shall be issued by the building official except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter unless he receives a written order from the board of adjustment in the form of an administrative review or variance as provided by this chapter. 
    126.6.6.2. Applications. Applications for building permits must be in strict compliance with the provisions set forth in the ordinances of the city. All applications for building permits, made upon a prescribed form, shall be accompanied by plans in triplicate drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions and shape of the lot to be built upon; the exact sizes and locations on the lot of all structures already existing, if any, and the location and dimensions of the proposed structure or alteration. The application shall include such other information as lawfully may be required by the building official, including existing or proposed building or alterations; existing or proposed uses of the building and land; the number of families, housekeeping units, or rental units the building is designed to accommodate; conditions existing on the lot; and such other matters as may be necessary to determine conformance with, and provide for the enforcement of this chapter. 
    The application shall be accompanied by a site plan that should provide the following minimum information: 
(a)  Boundaries of the area covered by the site plan; 
(b)  Location of each existing and proposed building and structure in the area; 
(c)  The location of existing drainage ways and significant natural features; 
(d)  Proposed landscaping and screening buffers; 
(e)  The location and dimensions of all curb cuts, public and private streets, parking and loading areas, pedestrian walks, lighting facilities, and outside storage facilities; 
(f)  The location, height and type of each wall, fence and all other types of screening; and 
(g)  The location, height and size of all proposed signs. 
    Of the three copies of the plans originally submitted, one copy of the plans shall be returned to the applicant by the building official, after he or she shall have marked such copy either as approved or disapproved and attested to it by his signature on such copy. The original and one copy of the plans, similarly marked, shall be retained by the building official. In case the applicant desires to appeal from the building official's refusal to issue the permit, the latter shall assist the applicant in the preparation of an appeal. 
    126.6.6.3. Certificates for new, altered, or nonconforming uses. It shall be unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any structure, land, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, converted, altered or enlarged in its use or dimensions until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the building official stating that the proposed use of the structure or land conforms to the requirements of this chapter. 
    No nonconforming structure or use shall be maintained, renewed, or changed until the building official shall have issued a certificate of occupancy. The certificate of occupancy shall state specifically how the nonconformity differs from the provisions of this chapter, provided that upon enactment of this chapter, owners or occupants of nonconformities shall have 90 days to apply for certificates of occupancy. Failure to make such application within 90 days shall be presumptive evidence that the property was an illegal nonconformity at the time of enactment or amendment of this chapter. 
    No permit for erection, alteration, moving, or repair of any building shall be issued until an application has been made for a certificate of occupancy, and the certificate shall be issued in conformance with the provisions of this chapter upon completion of the work. 
    The building official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a period not to exceed six months during alterations or partial occupancy of a building pending its completion, provided that such temporary certificate may include such conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public. 
    The building official shall maintain a record of all certificates of occupancy, and a copy shall be furnished upon request to any person. 
    Failure to obtain a certificate of occupancy shall be a violation of this chapter and punishable under the penalty section of this chapter. 
    126.6.6.4. Expiration of building permit. If the work described in any building permit has not begun within 180 days from the date of issuance thereof, said permit shall expire; the administrative official shall cancel it, and written notice thereof shall be given to the persons affected. 
    If work described in any building permit has not been substantially completed within one year of the date of issuance, said permit shall be cancelled by the administrative official, and written notice shall be given to the persons affected, together with notice that further work as described in the cancelled permit shall not proceed unless and until a new building permit has been obtained. 
    126.6.6.5. Construction and use to be as provided in application, plans, permits and certificates. Building permits or certificates of occupancy issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by the building official authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications, and no other use, arrangement, or construction, as further stipulated in ordinances adopted by the city. Use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be a violation of this chapter, and punishable as provided the penalties section below. 
    126.6.6.6. Fees. Reasonable fees sufficient to cover the costs of administration, inspection, publication of notice and similar matters may be charged to applicants for building permits, sign permits, conditional use permits, variances and other administrative relief. The amount of the fees charged shall be as set forth in the city's budget or as established by resolution of the city council filed in the office of the city secretary. 
    Fees established in accordance with the above paragraph shall be paid upon submission of a signed application or notice of appeal. 
( Ord. No. 2015-03, § II, 3-12-2015 ) 
Sec. 126.6.7. - Penalty-Continuing violations. 
    126.6.7.1. Penalty for violations. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter or who shall build or alter any building in violation of any detailed statement or plan submitted and approved under this chapter, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined in any sum not more than $2,000.00 and each day such violation continues or exists shall constitute a separate offense. The owner of any building or premises, or part thereof, where anything in violation of this chapter shall be placed or shall exist and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, person or corporation employed in connection therewith and who may have assisted in the commission of any such violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense, and upon conviction thereof be fined as provided in this section. 
( Ord. No. 2015-03, § II, 3-12-2015 )
