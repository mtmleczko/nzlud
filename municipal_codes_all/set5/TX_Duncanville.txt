PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the ordinances of the City of Duncanville, Texas, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the republished Code were the City's 1969 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council through Ordinance No. 1834, adopted March 18, 2003. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the 1969 Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the fifth section of Chapter 4 is 4-5. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 5-4 and 5-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-4.1, 5-4.2 and 5-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included with alphabetical lettering next to the chapter number. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This 2003 republication of the Code was under the supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and Bonnie Mitchell, Supplement Editor, of the corporation. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Jeanne Fralicks, City Secretary, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2.04. - Vacancies in council. 
    In the event a vacancy occurs in the office of the Mayor or Councilman, the Council shall call a special election to fill such vacancy for the unexpired term if there remains more than six (6) months remaining in such unexpired term at the time such vacancy occurs. If such unexpired term shall be less than six (6) months and more than ninety (90) days at the time such vacancy occurs, then such vacancy shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members of the Council within thirty (30) days of the vacancy and the person chosen shall serve for the unexpired term only. If such vacancy occurs within ninety (90) days prior to a general City election, then no special election shall be held and no appointment shall be made to fill such vacancy. 
    The special election shall be held during the period not less than thirty (30) days and not more than forty (40) days after the vacancy occurs, or if not permitted by prevailing law during such period, then such election shall be held on the earliest date after such period as permitted by prevailing law. 
    Nominations for a special election called pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall conform to the requirements of Section 7.03 of this Charter. Filing with the City Secretary shall be within the time fixed by the ordinance calling such special election.

Sec. 2.05. - Presiding officer: the mayor. 
    The Mayor shall preside at meetings of the City Council, and shall be recognized as head of City government for all ceremonial purposes and by the Governor for purposes of military law, but shall have no regular administrative duties. He may participate in the discussion of all matters coming before the Council. He shall be entitled to vote as a member thereof on legislative or other matters, commencing of and from the date that the Council member elected at large assumes the duties of office following the City's general election in May, 2003. The Council shall elect from among the councilmen a Mayor pro tempore who shall act as Mayor during the absence or disability of the Mayor. If a vacancy in the office of Mayor occurs, the Council shall select a Mayor from its own members who shall serve until the next regular election. His former place as councilman shall be deemed vacant and filled as provided for in Section 2.04. 
(Ord. No. 1783, approved 3-19-02, adopted at election 5-4-02) 
Sec. 2.06. - Powers. 
    Except as otherwise provided by this Charter, all powers of the City and the determination of all matters of policy shall be vested in the Council. Without limitation of the foregoing powers of the Council, the Council shall also have power to: 
(1)  Appoint and remove the City Manager;

(Ord. No. 1783, approved 3-19-02, adopted at election 5-4-02) 
Sec. 2.07. - Appointment of city manager. 
    The Council shall appoint a City Manager, at their discretion, for an indefinite term, who shall be the chief administrative and executive officer of the City. No member of the Council shall, during the term for which elected, be chosen as City Manager. The City Manager shall receive such compensation as may be fixed by the Council. Until such time the Council appoints a City Manager, the duties and functions of the City Manager shall be performed by the City Council. 
Sec. 2.08. - Removal of city manager. 
    The Council may remove the City Manager, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of full membership of the Council. If removed after serving three (3) months, he may demand written charges and the right to be heard thereon at a public meeting of the Council prior to the date on which his final removal shall take effect; but pending such hearing the Council may suspend him from office. The action of the Council in suspending or removing the City Manager shall be final, it being the intention of the Charter to vest all authority and fix all responsibility for such suspension or removal in the Council. 
Sec. 2.09. - Removal of other appointive officials. 
    The Council may, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the full membership of the Council, remove members of its appointive boards or commissions without notice, except as otherwise provided by state law.

Sec. 2.10. - Council not to interfere in city manager's appointments or removals. 
    Neither the Council or any of its members shall direct or request the appointment of any person to or his removal from office by the City Manager or by any of his subordinates. However, the Council may consult and advise the City Manager, make inquiry regarding the appointments or removals and may express their opinion in regard thereto. In regard to administrative and executive duties under the City Manager, the Council and its members shall deal solely through the City Manager and neither the Council nor any member thereof shall give orders to any subordinate of the City Manager, either publicly or privately. 
    Willful violation of the foregoing provisions of this Charter by any member of the Council shall constitute official misconduct and shall authorize the Council by a vote of a majority of its membership to expel such offending member from the Council if found guilty after a public hearing, and thereby create a vacancy in the place held by such member. 
Sec. 2.11. - Creation of new departments or offices.

He shall receive such salary as may be fixed by the Council. All costs and fines imposed by the municipal court shall be paid into the City Treasury for the use and benefit of the City. The Council shall have the authority to appoint alternate or temporary municipal court judges as provided by state law. 
(Ord. No. 1186, adopted 12-19-88, approved at election 1-21-89; Ord. No. 1491, adopted 1-21-97, approved at election 5-3-97) 
Sec. 2.13. - Induction of council into office; meetings of council. 
    The Council shall meet regularly at such times as may be prescribed by ordinance, but no less frequently than once each month. The first meeting of each newly elected Council, for induction into office, shall be the next regularly scheduled meeting following the election. All meetings of the Council shall be conducted in accordance with the Texas Open Meetings Act, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 1491, adopted 1-21-97, approved at election 5-3-97) 
Sec. 2.14. - Council to be judge of qualifications of its members.

Sec. 2.15. - Rules of procedure; minutes. 
    The Council shall determine its own rules and order of business. It shall keep minutes of its proceedings, and the minutes shall be open to public inspection.

It is expressly provided herein that an investment or ownership in a publicly held company, in an amount less than $15,000.00 does not constitute a substantial interest. Substantial interest in real property means the person has an interest in the real property that is equitable or legal ownership with a fair market value of $2,500.00 or more; and it is reasonably foreseeable that an action on a matter involving the real property will have a special economic effect on the value of the real property distinguishable from its effect on the public. (Ownership includes any partnership, joint or corporate ownership, or any equitable or beneficial interest as a beneficiary of a trust.) An officer is considered to have a substantial interest under this code of ethics if a relative has a substantial interest under this code of ethics.

If the city attorney determines that a criminal violation may exist, the matter will be referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency. If the city council determines that the complaint does not allege a violation or there is insufficient evidence of the alleged violation, the matter will be considered concluded. If the city council determines that the complaint alleges a violation of the code of ethics and there is sufficient evidence of a prima facie violation the city council will conduct a hearing. An officer who is the subject of a code of ethics complaint has a right to be represented by counsel, to call and examine witnesses, and present evidence. The city council, upon completion of a hearing, will render a decision whether a violation occurred or setting forth any requirements for voluntary compliance.

The building official shall send a notice of hearing to the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee of the property which shall include a statement that the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee will be required to submit at the hearing proof of the scope of any work that may be required to comply with the Code and the time it will take to reasonably perform the work. After a public hearing before the city manager or his designee, if the fence is found in violation of the standards set out in the Code, the city manager or his designee may order that the fence or enclosure be repaired, replaced, secured or remedied by the owner within a reasonable time. If the owner does not take the ordered action within the allotted time, the city shall make a diligent effort to discover each mortgagee and lienholder having an interest in the property on which the swimming pool is located.

1.  An identification, which is not required to be a legal description, of the property on which the swimming pool is located; 
2.  A description of the violation of city standards present on the property; and, 
3.  A statement that the city will repair, replace, secure, or remedy the fence or enclosure if the ordered action is not taken within a reasonable time. 
b.  If the enclosure or fence is on unoccupied property or is on property occupied only by persons who do not have a right of possession of the property, the city shall:

4.  Post the notice near or on the fence or enclosure or the residence where the fence or enclosure is located. 
The notice must contain: 
i.  An identification, which is not required to be a legal description, of the property on which the swimming pool enclosure is located;

c.  If the city incurs expenses while repairing or replacing the fence or enclosure, the city may assess the expenses on and the city has a lien against the property unless the property is a homestead and is protected by the Texas Constitution. The lien shall be extinguished if the property owner or another person having an interest in the legal title to the property reimburses the city for the expenses. The lien arises and attaches to the property at the time the notice of the lien is recorded in the office of the county clerk in Dallas County. The notice shall contain the name and address of the owner, if that information can be determined with a reasonable effort, a legal description of the real property on which the swimming pool or enclosure or fence is situated, the amount of expenses incurred by the city, and the balance due. The lien is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens and all previously recorded bona fide mortgage liens attached to the real property to which the city's lien attaches.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 9A-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Texas has in the Texas Water Code, section 16.311, et seq., delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 2018, § 1(Exh. A), 3-7-07) 
Sec. 9A-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2018, § 1(Exh. A), 3-7-07) 
Sec. 9A-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and, 
(7)  Insure the potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2018, § 1(Exh. A), 3-7-07) 
Sec. 9A-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2018, § 1(Exh. A), 3-7-07)

ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 9A-11. - Words, terms defined. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appeal means a request for review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one percent annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one per cent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon showing a good and sufficient cause; a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the criteria outlined in subsections (a) through (j) above are met and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade, at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade, at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified) or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, the structure is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 9A-33 are satisfied. 
(4)  Within zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes is required to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2018, § 1(Exh. A), 3-7-07) 
Sec. 9A-45. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 9A-17 are areas designed as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, the city may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base elevations, provided that the city first completes all the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 2018, § 1(Exh. A), 3-7-07) 
Sec. 9A-46. - Maintenance of drainage facilities. 
    All open drainage courses shall be maintained by the owner(s) of the land upon which they are located.

(b)  Procedures for abatement. The city manager or his designee is authorized to abate such nuisances under the following procedures. The procedures must be administered by a regularly salaried, full time employee of the city. The person authorized to administer these procedures may enter private property to examine a public nuisance, to obtain information to identify the nuisance, and to remove or direct any person to abate or remove the nuisance. 
(1)  Written notice shall be personally delivered or sent by certified mail with a five-day return requested to the last known registered owner of the nuisance, to each lien holder of record, and to the owner or occupant of the property on which the nuisance is located or, if the nuisance is located on a public right-of-way, the property adjacent to the right-of-way.

If notice is returned undelivered, action to abate the nuisance shall be continued to a date not earlier than the 11th day after the date of the return. 
(3)  Prior to removal of a public nuisance, a public hearing shall be conducted by a municipal judge of the city to determine the existence of a public nuisance and whether the nuisance should be abated and removed. If a property owner to whom notice has been sent requests a hearing, such hearing shall be conducted not earlier than the 11th day after the date of service of the notice. At the hearing, the junked vehicle is presumed, unless demonstrated otherwise, to be inoperable. An order requiring or authorizing the abatement and removal of a nuisance must include the vehicle's description, vehicle identification number, and license plate number, if that information is available at the location of the nuisance. 
(4)  Notice identifying the vehicle or part of the vehicle shall be given to the Texas Department of Public Safety not later than the fifth day after the date of removal. If a vehicle is removed, the vehicle shall not thereafter be reconstructed or made operable. 
(5)  These procedures do not apply to: 
(i)  A vehicle or vehicle part that is completely enclosed in a building in a lawful manner and is not visible from the street or other public or private property; 
(ii)  A vehicle or vehicle part that is stored or parked in a lawful manner on private property in connection with the business of a licensed vehicle dealer or junkyard; or, 
(iii)  An antique or special-interest vehicle stored by a collector on the collector's property, if the vehicle or part and the outdoor storage area are maintained in an orderly manner, not a health hazard, and screened from ordinary public view by appropriate means, including a fence, rapidly growing trees, or shrubbery. 
(6)  The relocation of a junked vehicle that is a public nuisance to another location in the city after a proceeding for the abatement and removal of the public nuisance has commenced has no effect on the proceeding if the junked vehicle constitutes a public nuisance at the new location. 
(7)  The judge of the municipal court of the city may issue orders appropriate or necessary to enforce these procedures. 
(c)  Penalties. A person commits an offense if that person maintains a public nuisance as determined under this article and, on conviction in the municipal court, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed the sum of $200.00 for each offense, and each and every day such offense shall continue shall be deemed to constitute a separate offense. On conviction, the court shall order removal and abatement of the nuisance. A person who fails to abate and remove a public nuisance after being ordered to do so by the municipal court shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, on conviction in the municipal court, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed the sum of $200.00 for each offense, and each and every day such offense shall continue shall be deemed to constitute a separate offense. The abatement and removal procedures authorized herein are in addition to and not in lieu of any remedies, civil or criminal, at law or in equity, to which the city may otherwise be entitled and are cumulative of all other remedies.

(f)  The payments hereunder are not payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically provided in this section, or as required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a registrant that is obligated to pay a fee ceases to provide service for any reason, such registrant shall make a final payment of any amounts owed to the municipality within 90 calendar days of the date its operations in the municipality cease.

The registrant will have not less than ten days from the date the notice is mailed to respond to the notice and show why revocation should not occur. The notice letter shall specifically identify the alleged or perceived violations and indicate the scheduled date for revocation.

If the appeal is filed prior to the date scheduled for revocation, the action will be stayed for 30 days to provide an opportunity for the city council to consider the appeal. If the council agrees to entertain the appeal, the registrant may submit written materials to the council prior to the council's consideration of the matter in a noticed public hearing. However, oral presentations related to the appeal are a matter of council discretion and not a matter of the REP's right.

(8)  An applicant has been convicted of an offense under any federal or estate law providing recordkeeping or licensing requirements for persons purchasing or selling regulated metal property, and three years have not elapsed since the termination of any sentence, parole or probation. The fact that a conviction is being appealed has no effect.

Proof must also be shown that he has obtained approval by other affected agencies of the city to actually perform the work. 
b.  A plan must be prepared by the contracting agency showing where work is to be performed. The plan will include a standard barricading layout showing placement of barricades, cones and informational signs used on the project. In most cases, layouts will be similar to those shown in the latter part of the attached manual. Deviation from the manual will be allowed only with approval of the responsible person. 
c.  The plan as mentioned in step b. above must be submitted a minimum of five business days prior to actual beginning of the construction work. This time period will allow the designated department the opportunity to survey the construction site in an attempt to uncover any traffic problems which might develop as a result of the barricading. 
d.  Each contractor or construction agency will provide with his barricading plan a listing of all persons directly responsible for the safety on each project to include an address or a telephone listing at which said person can be reached at any hour of the day if a hazardous condition develops. 
(2)  Contract work by city prepared construction plans. In the event the contractor undertakes work based on plans prepared by a department of the city, all detour and barricading requirements will be inserted as part of the construction plans. 
In this situation, the contractor's acceptance of the construction project will serve as indication that he understands the layout and is responsible subject to the penalties established in this article. 
(3)  City forces and public utility company requirements. 
a.  All city forces, as well as public utility companies performing construction work within a street which requires that a set of plans be drawn up due to the extensive and/or complex nature of work, will be subject to the same requirements established in subsection (b)(1) above. Such work would include major street construction (street cuts, street widening, etc.), water and sewerage line laying or relocation or off-street construction which requires that a portion of the adjacent roadway be barricaded. 
b.  Construction work performed by city forces or utility companies, minor enough such that a set of plans need not be drawn up, will not be subject to the same requirements established in subsection (b)(1) above. Such work includes minor street construction (resurfacing, patching, striping), minor utility work (usage of manholes such that a lane must be barricaded), etc. These forces will be required, however, to comply with all other provisions set forth in the manual as to the construction site barricade layout and signing. In addition, the responsible person shall be contacted before said construction work is begun and be informed of the location and nature of construction. This work shall not be performed during the peak hour congestion periods of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., unless approved by the responsible person. 
(c)  Emergency situations. The requirements as mentioned above are to be used for all planned construction projects. In the event of an emergency type situation, notification of work to be done can be made by telephone directly to the responsible person, thereby bypassing the requirements mentioned above. Under these conditions the contractor or agency will still be required to follow the basic barricading standards as outlined in the attached manual.

ARTICLE X - ROAD HUMP POLICY 

Sec. 19-167. - Road hump policy for residential neighborhoods. 
(a)  Definitions. 
(1)  Application means the written initial request and the petition submitted by a resident or representative of a neighborhood group. 
(2)  Residential dwellings include single-family houses, townhomes and duplexes. 
(3)  Road hump is a geometric design feature of a roadway, consisting of a raised area in the roadway pavement surface extending transversely across the travelway, whose sole purpose is to reduce the speed of vehicles traveling along the roadway. 
(4)  Street refers to the street segment that must be petitioned. It should be a continuous street between two intersecting streets and should be a minimum of 1,000 feet in length. 
(b)  Eligibility requirements. Many factors must be considered in locating road humps for optimal effectiveness. Isolated humps provide only point speed reductions and do not achieve an overall speed reduction effect. 
(1)  A petition documenting that a minimum of 90 percent of the property owners of all residential dwellings on the street support installation of the requested road hump(s). 
(2)  The street where the road hump is proposed must be composed primarily of residential dwellings. 
(3)  Conditions for locating road humps, including operational and geometric characteristics of the street, are as follows: 
a.  The street must be a local residential street or a residential collector street. 
b.  The street must be paved. If the road hump is located on a street with no curb and gutter, then a special design must be used to prevent vehicles from driving around a road hump. 
c.  The street pavement width can be no wider than 36 feet wide. 
d.  There must be no more than one moving lane of traffic in each direction. 
e.  Traffic volumes must be more than 400 vehicles per day but less than 3,000 vehicles per day. 
f.  The street must not be identified as a primary route for emergency vehicles. 
g.  The street must have a speed limit of 30 miles per hour or less in accordance with State law. 
h.  Vehicle speed must equal or exceed an 85th percentile speed of five miles over the posted speed limit. 
i.  The street must have adequate sight distance to safely accommodate the hump(s) as determined by the public works department. 
j.  The street must not have curves or grades that prevent safe placement of the hump(s). Road humps may be located on streets that contain curves and/or grades but the hump itself must be located not less than 200 feet from any horizontal curve with a radius of 1,000 feet or less. The vertical grade of the street may not exceed eight percent. 
k.  The elevation of property adjacent to a hump location must be above the top of the curb, or as determined by the public works department, to minimize potential flooding due to the presence of the hump in the roadway. 
l.  A road hump must be located downstream of drainage inlets. 
m.  A road hump must be placed perpendicular to the direction of travel. 
n.  A road hump must not be installed within 150 feet of an intersection. 
o.  A road hump should be located on property lines rather than in front of a residence, however it must not be located in front of a property if the owner objects to its placement. It is the responsibility of the applicant(s) to obtain approval from the property owner of majority of households to place road humps on property lines or in front of a residence. 
p.  A road hump should not be located at driveways or between ends of a loop driveway that presents an attractive run-around route. 
q.  A road hump must not be located over manholes, gate valves, utility vault accesses and similar features. 
r.  A road hump should be installed to take advantage of existing street lighting. 
(c)  Cost responsibility. The cost for the road hump installation (including signs, pavement markings and, if necessary, special design features such as curbing or guard rail) and/or removal is the property owner's responsibility. The cost for transportation engineering studies and maintenance of the road hump is the responsibility of the city. The term property owner, when used in cost sharing, does not necessarily refer to the petitioners, but is used to define the share of the cost that is not the responsibility of the city and should be paid by one or more or the residents or from other private resources. The city council reserves the right to waive the cost in cases of financial hardship. 
(d)  Design standards and procedures. The director of public works shall prepare and maintain current design standards and installation procedures for road humps in accordance with this article. 
(e)  Procedure for road hump installation. 
(1)  The initial request for the installation of road humps must originate from the property owners living on the street. A request in writing from a property owner or representative of a neighborhood group must be forwarded to: 
Road Hump Program 
Department of Public Works 
City of Duncanville 
P.O. Box 380280 
Duncanville, Texas 75138 
(2)  Upon receipt of the request, a preliminary determination of eligibility based on compliance with this article and available traffic data will be made in a timely manner. 
a.  If the street is determined not to be eligible, the applicant will be notified in writing of the reason for the denial. 
b.  The decision may be appealed in writing to the city manager within 15 days of the notification date. The city manager will review the determination and respond to the applicant within 30 days of the appeal request. Any subsequent petitions must show the reason for the original denial. 
c.  If the street is determined to be eligible for consideration of road hump installations, a meeting will be arranged between the applicant and staff to determine the petition area and the approximate road hump location range. The applicant will then be instructed to submit a petition containing the signatures of 90 percent of the property owners of all residential dwellings on the street in support of the installation of the road humps. Only petition forms (exhibit A) supplied by the city or photocopies of petition forms may be used for this purpose. 
(3)  Once the petition has been verified, the public works department will conduct the necessary studies and solicit comments and recommendations from other city departments. A determination of the street's eligibility for road hump installation will be made in a timely manner, based on the road hump ordinance. 
a.  If the street is determined not to be eligible for road hump installation, the applicant will be notified in writing giving the reason. 
b.  The decision may be appealed in the same manner as in subsection (2)b. above. 
c.  If the street is determined to be eligible, the street will be placed on a list of streets eligible for road hump installation. 
(4)  The city will make a determination of total installation cost. 
(5)  Once eligible for road hump installation, owners of real property lying within the notification area will be notified of the action by the city. The notification area consists of the area within 200 feet of the boundary of the street. The measurement of the 200 feet includes streets and alleys. The notice will include a return form to indicate support or objection to the proposed installation. 
(6)  If owners of 20 percent or more of the real property (as measured by front footage) within the notification area object to the installation within 30 days of the notice, the request will then be scheduled before a public hearing before the city council. The public works department will notify the applicant, and the owners of all property within the study area of the public hearing. 
(7)  If objections from less than 20 percent of the real property owners within the notification area are received or the city council approves the installation after a public hearing, then the city will place the street on a list of streets approved for road hump installation. 
(8)  Once a street is placed on the list of streets approved for road hump installation, the city will submit a statement to the applicant for the cost of the road hump installation. Upon receipt of payment of the cost, the humps will be installed as scheduling permits. If full payment has not been received within six months from the statement date, the street will be removed from the list of streets approved for road hump installation and all monies received, if any, returned to the payor. 
(f)  Road hump removal/alteration. The process for road hump removal or alteration by the property owners is the same as the process for installation. 90 percent of the property owners of all residential dwellings on the street must sign a petition in favor of removal. The cost for removal or alteration will be determined by the city and is the property owners' responsibility to pay. 
(g)  Road hump design. For information purposes only, the attached exhibit "B" shows typical road hump designs. 
The undersigned hereby petition for road humps on _______ _______ between _______ and _______. I understand that signing this petition does not obligate me to financially participate in their cost. I also understand that the provisions of the Road Hump Policy stipulate no road humps will be installed until prepaid for by parties other than the city.

ARTICLE XI. - AUTOMATED TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2226, § 1, adopted August 19, 2014 repealed ch. 19, art. XI, §§ 19-180-19-186, in its entirety; and enacted a new art. XI, to read as set out herein. Former art. XI pertained to "Automated Traffic Signal Enforcement," and was derived from Ord. No. 1971, § 1, adopted February 7, 2006 and Ord. No. 2028, § 1, adopted August 21, 2007. 

Sec. 19-180. - Definitions. 
    In this article: 
    Department shall mean the police department of the city of Duncanville, Texas. 
    Intersection shall mean the place or area where two or more streets or roadways intersect and is defined as the common area at the junction of two or more streets or roadways, the dimensions of which include only the common area within the connection of the lateral curb lines or, in the absence of curb lines, the lateral boundary lines of the streets or roadways. 
    Owner shall mean the owner of a motor vehicle as shown on the motor vehicle registration records of the state department of motor vehicles or the analogous department or agency of another state or country. 
    Photographic traffic signal enforcement system shall mean a system that:

(Ord. No. 2226, § 1, 8-19-14) 
Sec. 19-181. - Imposition of civil penalty for violations. 
(a)  The city council finds and determines that a vehicle that proceeds into an intersection when the traffic control signal controlling that vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal damages the public by endangering motor vehicle operators and pedestrians alike, by decreasing the efficiency of traffic control and traffic flow efforts, and by increasing the number of serious accidents to which public safety agencies must respond at the expense of the taxpayers. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsection (c), the owner of a motor vehicle is liable for a civil penalty of $75.00 if, while facing only a steady red signal displayed by an electrically operated traffic-control signal located in the city, the vehicle is operated in violation of the instructions of that traffic control signal, as specified by V.T.C.A. Transportation Code, Section 544.007(d). 
(c)  An owner who fails to timely pay the civil penalty shall be subject to a late payment penalty of $25.00. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 1, 8-19-14) 
Sec. 19-182. - Enforcement; procedures. 
(a)  The department shall be responsible for the enforcement and administration of this article.

b.  That imposition of the civil penalty may be contested by submitting a written request for an administrative adjudication hearing before the expiration of the period specified under subsection (c)(5); and 
c.  That failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely matter is an admission of liability and waiver of owner's right to appeal the imposition of the civil penalty.

(12)  Any other information deemed necessary by the department. 
(d)  A notice of violation under this article is presumed to have been received on the fifth day after the date the notice of violation is mailed.

(Ord. No. 2226, § 1, 8-19-14) 
Sec. 19-183. - Administrative adjudication hearing. 
(a)  A person who receives a notice of violation may contest the imposition of the civil penalty by requesting, in writing or by contacting the customer service representative at the phone number provided in the notice, an administrative adjudication of the civil penalty. Request for a hearing must be made on or before date specified in notice, which may not be earlier than the 30th day after the date the notice was mailed. Upon receipt of a timely request, the department shall within 60 days hold a hearing and notify the person of the date and time of the hearing on the administrative adjudication. The date for the hearing may be re-scheduled one time, provided a written request for continuance is filed by the owner of the vehicle at least five days prior to the scheduled hearing date. The administrative adjudication hearing shall be held before a hearing officer appointed by the city manager. 
(b)  Failure to pay a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner or failure to appear at a requested administrative adjudication hearing is an admission of liability in the full amount of the civil penalty assessed in the notice of violation, and is a waiver of the right to appeal. 
(c)  The civil penalty shall not be assessed if after a hearing, the hearing officer enters a finding of no liability. 
(d)  In an administrative adjudication hearing, the issues must be proved at the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(1)  The reliability of the photographic traffic signal enforcement system used to produce the recorded image of the violation may be attested to in an administrative adjudication hearing by affidavit of an officer or employee of the city or the entity with which the city contracts to install or operate the system and who is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system. An affidavit of an officer or employee of the city that alleges a violation based on an inspection of the pertinent recorded image is admissible in a proceeding under this article and in an appeal under section 19-187 and is evidence of the facts contained in the affidavit. 
(2)  The hearing officer shall have the authority to administer oaths and to issue orders compelling the attendance of witnesses and production of documents. 
(e)  A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing or who requests an administrative adjudication hearing and thereafter fails to appear at the time and place of the hearing is liable and must pay the civil penalty within 31 days of the date of the hearing. If the civil penalty is not paid timely, on the 32nd day following the hearing the person will become liable for a late payment fee in the amount of $25.00 in addition to the amount of the civil penalty assessed for the violation. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 1, 8-19-14)

(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, a person who fails to pay the amount of a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing on the violation if: 
(1)  The person files an affidavit with the hearing officer stating the date on which the person received the notice of violation; and 
(2)  Within 30 days from the date the notice was received as stated in the affidavit, the person requests an administrative adjudication hearing. 
(b)  If a person is granted a hearing pursuant to this section and is thereafter found liable, the person must, within 31 days of the date of the hearing pay the civil penalty or request an appeal in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 19-187. 
(c)  If the person was subject to a late payment penalty at the time of submission of the affidavit and request for a hearing under this section and: 
(1)  The person appears for the hearing and is found non-liable, then the person shall not be liable for the civil penalty or the previously imposed late payment penalty; or 
(2)  The person appears for a hearing and is found liable, if the person pays the amount of the civil penalty or submits a request for an appeal within 31 days of the date of the hearing, then the previously imposed late fee shall be waived. If the person is found liable but fails to timely pay the civil penalty within 31 days of the hearing or fails to timely file an appeal, then the previously imposed late payment penalty shall not be waived; or 
(3)  The person fails to appear for a hearing, then the previously imposed late payment penalty shall not be waived. 
(d)  If, at the time of submission of the affidavit and request for a hearing under this section, the city had notified the county assessor of nonpayment of the civil penalty and: 
(1)  The person appears for the hearing and is found non-liable, then the city shall promptly notify the county assessor to remove the hold on the person's registration; or 
(2)  The person appears for a hearing and is found liable, if the person timely pays the amount of the civil penalty or files a request for an appeal within 31 days of the date of the hearing, then the city shall notify the county assessor to remove the hold on the person's registration at the time of the payment; or 
(3)  The person appears for a hearing and is found liable but fails to timely pay the civil penalty within 31 days of the hearing or fails to timely file an appeal, then the city is not required to notify the county assessor to remove the hold on the person's registration; or 
(4)  The person fails to appear for a hearing, then the city is not required to notify the county assessor to remove the hold on the person's registration. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 1, 8-19-14) 
Sec. 19-185. - Presumption; defenses. 
(a)  It is presumed that the owner of the motor vehicle committed the violation alleged in the notice of violation mailed to the person if the motor vehicle depicted in a photograph or digital image taken by a photographic traffic signal enforcement system belongs to the owner of the motor vehicle. 
(b)  It shall be an affirmative defense to the imposition of civil liability under this article, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, that: 
(1)  The traffic-control signal was not in proper position and sufficiently legible to an ordinarily observant person; 
(2)  The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of a police officer; 
(3)  The operator of the motor vehicle violated the instructions of the traffic-control signal so as to yield the right-of-way to an immediately approaching authorized emergency vehicle; 
(4)  The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle under Chapter 546 of the Texas Transportation Code and that the operator was acting in compliance with that chapter; 
(5)  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle and being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner. To demonstrate that at the time of the violation the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate, the owner must submit proof acceptable to the hearing officer that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency; 
(6)  The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was a stolen plate and being displayed on a motor vehicle other than the motor vehicle for which the plate had been issued; 
(7)  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually hazardous road conditions existed that would make compliance with this article and with the traffic control signal more dangerous under the circumstances than noncompliance; or 
(8)  The person who received the notice of violation was not the owner of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. 
(9)  If, at the time of the violation, the motor vehicle depicted in the photograph or digital image was owned by a person in the business of selling, renting or leasing motor vehicles or by a person who was not the person named in the notice, the presumption under subsection (a) is rebutted upon presentment of evidence that the vehicle was at the time: 
a.  Being test driven by another person; 
b.  Being rented or leased by the vehicle owner to another; or 
c.  Owned by a person who was not the person named in the notice. 
(10)  If an affirmative defense of non-ownership or in the business of selling, renting or leasing a motor vehicle under subsection (b)(8) or (b)(9), then owner may submit an affidavit or written statement under penalty of perjury by mail to the department attesting to the facts under such subsections. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 1, 8-19-14) 
Sec. 19-186. - Order. 
(a)  Following an administrative adjudication hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written order stating:

(b)  The notice of appeal must be filed not later than the 31st day after the date on which the administrative adjudication hearing officer entered the finding of civil liability and must be accompanied by payment of the costs required by law for the court. In order to perfect the appeal the person must file a notarized statement of personal financial obligation to perfect such appeal. Upon filing of this statement, the appeal will stay the enforcement and collection of the civil penalty. 
(c)  An appeal shall be determined by the municipal court by trial de novo. Any affidavits submitted at the administrative adjudication hearing to establish the reliability of the photographic traffic signal enforcement system shall be admitted by the municipal judge in the trial de novo, and the facts must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.

(3)  a.  The fixed rate established for residential users is $14.07 per unit for the first 1,000 gallons per unit (minimum charge) 
b.  The variable rate for residential users is based on a user charge of $6.01/1,000 gallons of wastewater. The monthly volume of wastewater generated by a residential user shall be assumed equivalent to the average monthly water consumption for the preceding December, January, and February, with a 20,000 gallon maximum. The wastewater fee will become effective and applied to all bills starting with April. This fee will be held constant and reflected in the following months of April through March. In the case of a customer moving into a residence during the months of April through March for which a wastewater charge has previously been established, the new customer shall pay the usage for similar customers or may assume a monthly volume of wastewater of 7,000 gallons wastewater charge for that residence until the next rerating. The city manager or his designee may adjust this rate in appropriate situations and, if no previous rate has been established because the residence is newly constructed, may set the rate until the next rerating. In setting the rate for newly constructed residences, the city manager or his designee shall take into consideration the usage for similar customers or may assume a monthly volume of wastewater of 7,000 gallons. 
(4)  a.  The fixed rate for each unit in a multifamily dwelling is $6.63 per for the first 1,000 gallons per unit (minimum charge). 
b.  The variable rate for multifamily users is based on a user charge of $6.76/1,000 gallons. The monthly volume of wastewater generated by a multi-family user shall be assumed to be 0.90 times the volume of water consumed for the month. 
(5)  a.  The fixed rate established for each commercial, school and municipal user is $6.63 per unit for the first 1,000 gallons per unit (minimum charge). 
b.  The variable rate for commercial, school and municipal users is based on a user charge of $6.76/1,000 gallons. The monthly volume of wastewater generated by a commercial, school or municipal user shall be assumed to be 0.85 times the volume of water consumed for the month. 
(6)  Upon a showing by a commercial user that a portion of the water consumed by the user does not reach the sanitary sewer system of the city, a reduction shall be allowed for the water shown to the satisfaction of the city not to have reached the sanitary sewer system of the city; provided, however, that where the volume of water shown exceeds 50,000 gallons per month or 20 percent of the total water consumed by the user, whichever is more, no reduction shall be allowed to any commercial user where consumption is less than an average of 50,000 gallons per month. 
(7)  Every user who discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids other than normal sewage shall be charges and pay a surcharge in addition to the charge for normal sewage. Such surcharge shall be determined in accordance with the following schedule: 
S=13.24×10 4 (Vs) (BOD-250) +7.33×10 4 (Vs) (SS-250) 
where 
S = Surcharge in dollars monthly 
Vs = Sewage volume in thousand gallons per month 
BOD = BOD concentration in mg/l of waste being treated 
SS = SS concentration in mg/l of waste being treated 
250 = Allowed concentration on BOD in mg/l 
250 = Allowed concentration of SS in mg/l 
This formula is based on a unit charge for BOD of $0.159 per pound and unit charge for SS of $0.088 per pound. 
(8)  The user charge portion of the rate structure will be reviewed annually to accomplish the following: 
a.  Insure that the extant user charge rate is adequate to cover operation, maintenance, and replacement costs. 
b.  Insure that operation, maintenance, and replacement costs are being distributed proportionally among users and user classes. 
(9)  The said rates shall never be reduced below an amount sufficient to provide for the operation and maintenance of the said wastewater treatment system and for the principal of and interest on existing bonds and shall, when necessary, be increased to provide for said operation and maintenance and for the payment of the principal of and interest on existing bonds. 
(10)  None of the facilities or services afforded by the wastewater treatment system shall be furnished without a charge being made therefor. In the event the city, or any instrumentality thereof, shall avail itself of any of the facilities or services so afforded, the reasonable value thereof shall be charged against the city, or such instrumentality, and shall be paid for as the charges thereof accrue. The revenues so received from the city shall be deemed to be revenues so received from the operation of the wastewater treatment system and shall be used and accounted for in the same manner as any other revenues derived from its operation; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the city, or any instrumentality thereof, to avail itself of the facilities or services afforded by the wastewater treatment system.

Cross reference- Rules of construction generally, § 1-3. 
(Ord. No. 338, § 1, 2-12-65; Ord. No. 640, § 1, 9-15-75) 
Sec. 20-31. - Authority to make. 
    The water department may extend water and sanitary sewer mains in the streets, alleys, or easements, within the city limits, in order to permit connections by persons desiring and seeking water service and sanitary sewer service. 
(Ord. No. 338, § 2, 2-12-65) 
Sec. 20-32. - Work to be done by city or under city contract; exception. 
    All water and sanitary sewer main extensions provided for in this article shall be laid, constructed and installed by the city directly, or under a contract made by the city, except as otherwise provided in section 20-37. 
(Ord. No. 338, § 11, 2-12-65) 
Sec. 20-33. - Pro rata charge generally. 
    A charge, which shall be known as the "pro rata" shall be made against each lot or tract of land, and the owner thereof, whose water or sewer line is connected with any water mains or sewer mains in the city, and the charge shall be at the rates established by appropriate resolution of the city council from time to time. In addition to the pro rata charge on water and sewer mains to be established by said resolution, the property owner must pay the tap charges as established by appropriate ordinance or resolution. 
(Ord. No. 1161, § 1, 6-6-88) 
Sec. 20-34. - Purpose of article; variation in method of determining charges. 
    The intent and purpose of this article is to provide an equitable charge for water and sanitary sewer connections as a proportionate distribution of the cost of water and sanitary sewer main extensions to serve property in the city. In case property or a tract of land is so situated or shaped that the pro rata charge established by resolution of the city council creates an inequitable basis as between it and other tracts of land in the city, the city engineer shall determine the proper charge in accord with the intent and purpose of this article and shall recommend such charge to the city council for consideration and approval by appropriate amending resolution. 
(Ord. No. 1161, § 2, 6-6-88) 
Sec. 20-35. - Extension for individual owners. 
(a)  Upon request of the owner, or his agent, of a given lot or tract of land, accompanied by the payment of the charges due under this article, the city shall extend, lay or construct all necessary sanitary sewer and water mains, including valves and hydrants, a distance of 100 feet, plus the distance across the frontage necessary to provide the service for which application has been made. The applicant to be served shall be required to pay the charges herein provided for. The owners of all intervening property served by the given main extensions shall be required to pay the charges provided for herein at such time as their property is connected to the mains thus laid. Where an applicant for service secures an extension and service under this particular option for main extension, he shall pay the pro rata charges on all property owned by him and which is served by the requested extension. In applying the 100-foot rule, the required extension of the main shall be figured in such a manner as to leave out of the calculation that portion of any main adjacent to property already having other than a temporary water service and for which the pro rata charge thereon has been paid or credited under the terms of this article. 
(b)  An exception to the above 100-foot rule shall be made where two or more individual applicants desire water and/or sewer service and the nearest applicant is more than 100 feet from existing water lines, in which case the city will extend its mains upon payment of the charge due under this article, provided there is one customer for every 100 feet of such extension, excluding street intersections and that portion of the extension adjacent to property already having other than temporary water and/or sewer service. 
(c)  At the option of the city, the following method for extending water and sewer mains may be used where the applicant's property is more than 100 feet from an existing water or sewer main. This method shall be available only for use by an individual owner, person or corporation to secure water and sewer service for the individual's residence or place of business. Where eligible for this option, the owner may advance and pay to the city the entire pro rata cost as set forth in this article. On all property served by the desired main extension, the city, when said money has been actually deposited with the city, will construct the desired water or sewer main along the street, alley or easement. When any property for which such person has advanced the pro rata cost is connected to the main extension, then, in that event, the pro rata cost so advanced on that particular property shall be refunded by the city to the person making the original deposit. 
(d)  Where an extension is requested by an industry or commercial concern using large quantities of water and which cannot meet the requirements of one customer per 100 feet of extension, such extension may be made at the discretion of the city council, provided 40 percent of the estimated annual revenue from such customer will support interest and principal for a ten-year payout of the cost of such extension, bearing interest at the rate of ten percent per annum. 
(Ord. No. 338, §§ 3, 4, 2-12-65) 
Sec. 20-36. - Extension for property subdivided or platted for development and resale-Generally. 
(a)  Where extensions of water and sewer mains are required to serve property which has been subdivided or platted for development and resale, the city will construct such main upon deposit of the total cost of such extensions, including the cost of approach mains fronting property not owned by the developer, but necessary to connect the area for which application is made with the city water and sewer system. 
    The developer will bear the total cost for construction of off-site or approaching mains required to interconnect property to be developed with existing mains, the sizes to be determined by the city, and with the only refunds to be the pro rata cost as collected by the water department. 
    Any refund to the developer shall not exceed the cost of the pro rata charges if this means has been used to calculate the cost of water and sewer mains. 
    There shall be a maximum of ten years as the period of eligibility wherein the original depositor may request a refund of pro rata payments under this section. The period of eligibility shall begin as of the date of final inspection and acceptance of the extensions by the city. 
(b)  The developer will bear the cost of on-site mains, with sizes to be determined by the city, except that the city will refund the increment of cost on water and sewer mains over eight inches in diameter proportionately as the frontage served is connected. The increment of cost borne by the city shall be determined on the basis of the difference between the price bid for eight inch water and sewer mains and the larger size required; provided that, in the event the bid price for mains larger than eight inches are not considered reasonable by the city, the city will not be obligated to proceed under the terms of this article. 
(c)  Where temporary lines are constructed as an expedient to develop a particular area, such as across easements within the subdivision of which no frontage can be connected, or where sewers are constructed which otherwise are not required in the ultimate plan of development for the sanitary sewer system, the developer will bear the total cost without refund. 
(Ord. No. 338, §§ 5-7, 2-12-65) 
Sec. 20-37. - Same-Alternative plan. 
(a)  At the option of the city and as an alternative plan to that prescribed in section 20-36, the developer may be permitted to pay for the total cost of installation of water and sewer extensions as provided for in this section in lieu of paying the pro rata charge provided for in this article. Upon approval by the city, a developer of an addition or plat shall design and prepare construction plans of water and sanitary sewer facilities, or either of them, to serve the subdivision, including any access or off-site facilities that may be required. These plans shall conform in all details to the city's standards as to the design, grade, location, size and quality of materials and construction. 
(b)  Plans and profiles submitted by the developer's engineer shall be inked and on standard 24 inch by 36 inch sheets of tracing linen. Plans and profiles shall be shown at scales of not less than one inch to 100 feet horizontal, and one inch to six feet vertical. Plans and profiles shall show clearly all surface improvements, all existing or proposed subsurface utility lines and obstructions, and street and alley grades as approved by the water department or city engineer. The engineer submitting the plans and profiles must be a registered professional civil engineer in the state, and he must affix his seal and signature to the tracings of all plans and profiles. The completed tracings for water and sewer plans and profiles shall be submitted to the water department or city engineer for approval, accompanied by three copies of the plans and profiles of the storm sewers and street grades as approved by the city engineer and one copy of the plat of the addition that has been recorded in the records of the County of Dallas and has been so stamped. Upon final approval, the tracings will be returned to the developer's engineer for the purpose of making such prints as he may require, after which the tracings shall be returned to become the permanent property of the city. 
(c)  When the project is ready for construction, line and grade stakes will be set by the developer's engineer, but these stakes will not be set until after the developer's engineer has properly staked, on the ground with iron pins, all points of curves, all points of tangency, all block corners, and all lot corners within the subdivision. All construction and installation of water and sewer mains shall be supervised by inspectors of the city. 
(d)  All construction contracts shall be let upon city standard specifications for materials and performance. 
(e)  Upon approval of the plans by the city, the developer may enter into a contract with any individual or may himself construct the system as so planned; provided, however, that the construction and installation of the waterlines and sewer lines, or either of them, shall be supervised by inspectors of the city, to see that the installation is made in accordance with the plans and the city's standard specifications, which, in every instance, shall be a part of such installation contract. 
(f)  No installation of water or sewer mains shall be made at any other location except a dedicated street, alley, or an easement running in favor of the city, which shall be filed of record by the owner of the addition. Any such installation, when made, shall become the property of the city, free and clear of all encumbrances, and any contract entered into between the developer and a contractor shall provide for a performance bond such as the city uses in its standard specifications and contract documents. In the event the developer makes the installation himself, he shall execute a performance bond in favor of the city in the same form and conditioned in the same manner as provided for in the standard contract documents used by the city in the making of water and sanitary sewer installations.

* No industry shall discharge wastewater containing BOD or TSS loading that causes the city pro-rata share of the total BOD or TSS loading to the POTW system to exceed the pro-rata share of the total flow to the system. (Example: If the city contributes 25 percent of the total wastewater flow to the system, the cumulative BOD or TSS loading to the system, as measured at the point of entry to the system, shall not exceed 25 percent of the total BOD or TSS loading to the system.) Any industry with a wastewater strength that will cause the cumulative wastewater loading at the point of entry to exceed the city's pro-rata share of the total wastewater loading based upon flow shall be required to install pretreatment facilities to reduce its wastewater strength to an acceptable level. 
**BOD(5) and TSS are surcharge limits only not to be used for compliance. 
    The above limits apply to the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations of metallic substance are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The director may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentrations-based limitations above. 
(e)  Right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
(f)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2114, § 1, 6-15-10) 
Sec. 20-56. - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
(a)  Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 20-55 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, the control authority, or the director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at user expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be acceptable to the director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(3)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided for the proper handling of wastewater containing grease, oil or sand as required in section 20-125 of this chapter. Such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interceptor units shall be of type and capacity approved by the director and shall be located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be designed, installed, inspected, cleaned, repaired, and maintained regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense per section 20-127 of this chapter. 
(4)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter, or other control device as deemed necessary by the director. 
(c)  Slug control plans. At least once every two years, the director shall evaluate whether each permitted SIU needs a slug control plan.

A slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the director and/or control authority of any slug discharge, as required by this article; and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(d)  Septage waste. 
(1)  Septage waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the director and/or control authority, and at such times as are established by the director and/or control authority. Such waste shall not violate section 20-55 of this article or any other requirements established by the city. The director and/or control authority may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
(2)  Septage waste haulers must provide a manifest form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the hauler, the waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, disposal site and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. The hauler shall retain a completed manifest in its business office for three years after disposal.

d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the director, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (j). 
3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (k). 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the user and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection (b). 
h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 20-57(f). 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (a)(2)g.:

All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 20-57(f). 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the discharge of the user. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed in subsections (j) and (k) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of any planned significant changes to its operation or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. 
(1)  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection 20-57(e). 
(2)  The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under subsection 20-57(g), or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection 20-58(d), in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants that are determined to be of concern. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director and the appropriate control authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director as the director may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the director monitors the facility at least once a month, or if the director samples between the initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such, constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place not later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsection (a), (c) and (d). 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued hereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (2), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(l)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director or control authority. 
(Ord. No. 2114, § 1, 6-15-10) 
Sec. 20-60. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Right of entry. Inspection and sampling. The director or control authority, TCEQ, EPA, or their authorized representative shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. User shall allow the inspecting or sampling person(s) ready access to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the inspecting or sampling person(s) will be permitted to enter without delay for purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The director or control authority shall have the right to set up on the property of the user, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the operations. Sampling performed by POTW to monitor compliance shall be at the expense of the user. 
(3)  The director or control authority may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at a minimum annually to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the director or control authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the inspecting or sampling person(s) access to the premises of the user shall be a violation of this article. 
(6)  In accordance with 40 CFR 403, the city shall inspect and monitor each permitted industrial user a minimum of once per year. If the city elects to perform compliance monitoring for the industry, the city will monitor the industry a minimum of once semi-annually. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the director or control authority representative has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the director or control authority representative may seek issuance of a search warrant from an appropriate court. 
(Ord. No. 2114, § 1, 6-15-10) 
Sec. 20-61. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director and/or control authority, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 2114, § 1, 6-15-10) 
Sec. 20-62. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
    The director shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation that the director and/or control authority believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that have caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or have resulted in the director and/or control authority exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s) which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 2114, § 1, 6-15-10) 
Sec. 20-63. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Reserved. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Administrative orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an administrative order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Administrative orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer, and pretreatment or control of the quantities and rates of discharge of wastewater to bring the discharge within the limits of this article. An order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does an administrative order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of an administrative order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Reserved. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a failure of a user to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection and/or water connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection (c) or (h). 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in subsection 20-58(f) any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the premises of the user for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 20-55. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection 20-63(c), why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 2114, § 1, 6-15-10) 
Sec. 20-64. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the district court for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $l,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The director may recover reasonable attorneys, fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through violation of the user, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution; criminal responsibility. 
(1)  A user who violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, further regulations and procedures established by the director and/or control authority or an administrative order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $2,000.00 per violation, per day. 
(2)  A user who introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to the same penalties described in subsection (c)(1). This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury for property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $2,000.00 per violation. 
(4)  Criminal responsibility. A culpable mental state is not required to prove an offense under this article. A person is criminally responsible for a violation of this article if: 
a.  The person commits or assists in the commission of a violation, or causes or permits another person to commit a violation; or 
b.  The person owns or manages the property or facilities determined to be the cause of the illegal discharge under subsection 20-55(a)(b)(d), subsection 20-56(d), or subsection 20-57(b). 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the enforcement response plan of the city. However, the director may take another action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(e)  Applicability of more stringent regulations. 
(1)  If national pretreatment standards, categorical or otherwise, more stringent than the discharge limits prescribed in this article are promulgated by the EPA for certain industries, the more stringent national pretreatment standards will apply to the affected industrial user. A violation of the more stringent national pretreatment standards will also be considered a violation of this article. 
(2)  Applicability of more stringent discharge limits. An industrial user within the city who discharges industrial waste ultimately received and treated by another governmental entity pursuant to a wholesale wastewater contract or a reciprocal agreement with the city is subject to the following additional rules: 
a.  If the governmental entity has more stringent discharge limits than those prescribed by this article, or by a discharge permit issued hereunder, because the EPA requires the more stringent discharge limits as a part of the governmental entity's wastewater pretreatment program, the more stringent discharge limits shall prevail. 
b.  The director is authorized to issue a discharge permit to an industrial user affected by subsection a., above, to insure notice of and compliance with the more stringent discharge limits. If the industrial user already has a discharge permit, the director may amend the permit to apply and enforce the more stringent discharge limits. An industrial user shall submit to the director an expected compliance date and an installation schedule if the more stringent discharge limits necessitate technological or mechanical adjustments to discharge facilities or plant processes. 
c.  If the director chooses not to issue or amend a permit under subsection b., above, the director shall notify the affected industrial user in writing of the more stringent discharge limits and their effective date. Regardless of whether or not a permit is issued or amended, an industrial user shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comply with the more stringent discharge limits. 
d.  The more stringent discharge limits cease to apply upon termination of the wholesale wastewater contract or reciprocal agreement of the city with the governmental entity, or upon modification or elimination of the limits by the governmental entity or the EPA. The director shall take the appropriate action to notify the affected industrial user of an occurrence under this paragraph. 
(3)  Variances in compliance dates. The director may grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry when, in the director's opinion, such action is necessary to achieve pretreatment or corrective measures. In no case shall the director grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry affected by national categorical pretreatment standards beyond the compliance dates established by the EPA. 
(4)  Authority to regulate. The director may establish regulations, not in conflict with this article or other laws, to control the disposal and discharge of industrial waste into the wastewater system and to insure compliance of the city's pretreatment enforcement program with all applicable pretreatment regulations promulgated by the EPA. The regulations established shall, where applicable, be made a part of any discharge permit issued to an industrial user by the director. 
(Ord. No. 2114, § 1, 6-15-10) 
Sec. 20-65. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Force majeure provision. 
(1)  An event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely by an act of God, war, riot, or other catastrophe is not a violation. 
(2)  In an enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, riot, or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. 
(3)  In the event that an act of God, war, riot, or other catastrophe has been established, the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent possible until such time as reduction, lose, or failure of its treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(b)  Reserved. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of the treatment facility of the user. 
b.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section. 
(3)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(4)  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(5)  Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsections (3) and (4) of this section. 
(6)  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (4) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2114, § 1, 6-15-10) 
Sec. 20-66. - Charges, fees, surcharge and termination. 
(a)  Termination of water and/or sewer service. The city reserves the right to terminate water and sewer service for any of the following: 
(1)  Failure to pay pretreatment charges and fees; 
(2)  Failure to pay surcharge fees; 
(3)  Failure to pay any other fees, fines and penalties chargeable by the city; 
(4)  Failure to notify the director of significant changes to wastewater prior to the changed discharge; 
(5)  Failure to provide prior notification to the director of changed conditions pursuant to subsection 20-59(e); 
(6)  Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge permit application; 
(7)  Falsifying self-monitoring reports; 
(8)  Tampering with monitoring equipment; 
(9)  Refusing to allow the director timely access to the facility premises and records; 
(10)  Failure to meet effluent limitations; 
(11)  Failure to meet compliance schedules; 
(12)  Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit application; 
(13)  Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business ownership of a permitted facility; or 
(14)  Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this article. 
(b)  Pretreatment charge and fees. The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program which may include: 
(1)  Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications; 
(2)  Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures, including the cost of collection and analyzing the discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
(3)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  Fees for filing appeals; and 
(5)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the city. 
(c)  Surcharge. The city may surcharge industrial users for the treating of abnormal strength wastes. Water or wastes having (1) a five-day biochemical oxygen demand greater than 250 milligrams per liter (mg/L) by weight or (2) containing more than 250 milligrams per liter (mg/L) by weight of total suspended solids shall be subject to the review and approval of the director and the control authority. Where the director has approved the admission of (1) or (2) above into the POTW, that discharge may be subject to a surcharge as determined by the director and control authority. In no case shall a discharge be accepted that will prevent the POTW from meeting its limits. 
    The surcharge will be assessed according to the following formula each month using the most current pollutant concentration data and the current month wastewater flow: 
    Surcharge = Q / 1,000,000 x [a(BOD - x) + b(TSS - y)][8.34] 
    where: 
Q = flow in gallons 8.34 = weight in pounds of one gallon of water x = normal limits of BOD in domestic wastewater expressed in milligrams per liter y = normal limits of TSS in domestic wastewater expressed in milligrams per liter a = unit of cost of treatment per pound of BOD b = unit of cost of treatment per pound of TSS  
    A surcharge is an additional charge by the POTW for the increased cost of handling discharge of unusual strength and character and shall not serve as a variance to the requirements of this article. Exercise of this provision shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

(1)  Primary operators of large construction activities, or who are otherwise required by the permitting authority to obtain authorization for stormwater discharges associated with construction activity, shall submit a notice of intent (NOI) to the permitting authority in accordance with the construction permit. A copy of the signed and certified NOI shall be provided to the control authority and any secondary operator in accordance with the construction permit. 
Primary and secondary operators shall sign and certify a completed TCEQ construction site notice in accordance with the construction permit. A copy of the construction site notice shall be provided to the control authority in accordance with the construction permit. 
All persons meeting the definition of secondary operator are regulated by the construction permit, but are not required to submit an NOI, provided that another operator at the site has submitted an NOI, or is required to submit an NOI and the secondary operator has provided notification to the operator of the need to obtain coverage (with records of notification available upon request). 
(2)  Primary operators shall post copies of the signed and certified NOI and construction site notice at the construction site in a location where they are safely and readily available for viewing by the general public and the control authority prior to commencement of construction activities, and shall be maintained at that location until final stabilization has been completed on all disturbed areas, or until a new operator assumes control over the construction activity and applies for permit coverage. 
Secondary operators shall post a copy of the signed and certified construction site notice at the construction site in a location where it is safely and readily available for viewing by the general public and the control authority prior to commencement of construction activities, and shall be maintained at that location until final stabilization has been completed on all disturbed areas, or until a new operator assumes control over the construction activity and applies for permit coverage. 
(3)  If the construction project is of a linear nature (e.g. highway, pipeline, etc.), the notices shall be placed in a publicly accessible location near where construction is actively underway, and shall be relocated, as necessary, along the length of the project. The notice shall be posted in a location where it is safely and readily available for viewing by the general public and the control authority. 
(4)  Discharges of stormwater runoff from construction support activities, including concrete batch plants, asphalt batch plants, equipment staging areas, material storage yards, material borrow areas, and excavated material disposal areas may not be required to be authorized under a separate construction permit, provided that the activity is conducted in accordance with the construction permit. 
(5)  If an operator becomes aware that it submitted incorrect information, failed to submit relevant information, or that relevant information submitted in the NOI has changed, the operator shall submit a notice of change (NOC) letter to the permitting authority, and provide a copy of the signed letter to the control authority, within 14 days of discovering such information. 
(6)  Operators of small construction activities may be automatically authorized under the construction permit, and operators of these construction sites are not required to submit an NOI provided that they: 
a.  Develop a stormwater pollution prevention plan in accordance with the provisions of the construction permit; 
b.  Sign and certify a completed TCEQ construction site notice; 
c.  Post a copy of the signed and certified construction site notice at the construction site in a location where it is safely readily available for viewing by the general public and the control authority, prior to commencement of construction activities, and maintain the notice in that location through the date of final stabilization, or until a new operator assumes control over the construction activity and applies for permit coverage; and 
d.  Provide a copy of the signed and certified construction site notice to the control authority in accordance with the requirements of the construction permit. 
(7)  All notices of intent, notices of termination, notices of change letters, and TCEQ construction site notices shall be signed in accordance with title 30 §§ 305.44 and 305.128 of the Texas Administrative Code. 
(8)  Construction activities that do not qualify as a small or large construction activity under the construction permit shall be exempt from this ordinance but satisfy all local permitting and approval requirements prior to being authorized to discharge stormwater. 
(d)  Best management practices. 
(1)  The operator, owner or contractor shall use best management practices to control and reduce the discharge, to the MS4 and water in the state, of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with clearing, grading, excavation, and any other construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. Such best management practices and erosion control measures are detailed in the NCTCOG iSWM Criteria Manual and may include, but are not limited to, the following measures: 
a.  Ensuring that existing vegetation is preserved where feasible and that disturbed portions of the construction site are stabilized, in accordance with the requirements of the construction permit, on portions of the construction site where construction activities have temporarily or permanently ceased. Stabilization measures may include, but are not limited to the following: 
1.  Temporary seeding; 
2.  Permanent seeding; 
3.  Mulching; 
4.  Sod stabilization; 
5.  Vegetative buffer strips; 
6.  Protection of trees; and 
7.  Preservation of mature vegetation. 
Stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable in portions of the site where construction activities temporarily or permanently ceased, and except as provided herein, shall be initiated no more than 14 days after the construction activity in that portion of the site has temporarily or permanently ceased. 
b.  Where construction activity on a portion of the site is temporarily ceased, and earth-disturbing activities will be resumed within 21 days, temporary stabilization measures are not required. 
c.  Where the initiation of stabilization measures by the 14th day after construction activity temporarily or permanently ceased is precluded by snow cover or frozen ground conditions, stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as practicable. 
Where stabilization measures are utilized, erosion and sediment control measures shall remain in place and be maintained until the area of disturbance meets the definition of final stabilization in this article. 
(2)  Use of structural practices to divert flows from exposed soils, store flows, or otherwise limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from the construction site to the extent feasible; 
(3)  Minimization of the tracking of sediments offsite by vehicles, the generation of dust, and the escape of other wind-blown wastes from the construction site; 
(4)  Prevention of the discharge of building materials, including cement, lime, concrete, and mortar, to the MS4 or water in the state; 
(5)  Providing general good housekeeping measures to prevent and contain spills of paints, solvents, fuels, septic waste, and other hazardous chemicals and pollutants associated with construction, and to ensure proper cleanup and disposal of any such spills in compliance with state, federal, and local requirements; 
(6)  Implementation of proper waste disposal and waste management techniques, including covering and minimizing ground contact with waste materials; 
(7)  Timely maintenance of vegetation, erosion and sediment control measures, and other best management practices in good and effective operating condition; and 
(8)  Installation of permanent structural measures during the construction process to control pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed. Such installed structural measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Stormwater detention structures (including wet ponds); 
b.  Stormwater retention structures; 
c.  Flow attenuation by use of open vegetative swales and natural depressions; 
d.  Other velocity dissipation devices; 
e.  Infiltration of runoff onsite; and 
f.  Sequential systems, which combine several practices. 
(9)  The washing out of concrete trucks at construction sites shall be permitted, provided the following requirements are met: 
a.  Direct discharge of concrete truck wash out water to the MS4 or surface water in the state is prohibited; 
b.  Concrete truck washout water shall be discharged to areas at the construction site where structural controls have been established to prevent direct discharge to the MS4 or surface water in the state or to areas that have a minimal slope that allow infiltration and filtering of wash out water to prevent direct discharge. Structural controls may consist of temporary berms, temporary shallow pits, temporary storage tanks with a slow rate release, or other reasonable measures to prevent runoff from the construction site; 
c.  Washout of concrete trucks during rainfall events shall be minimized. The direct discharge of concrete truck washout water is prohibited at all times and the operator shall ensure that its BMPs are sufficient to prevent the discharge of concrete truck washout water as a result of rain; 
d.  The discharge of wash out water shall not cause or contribute to groundwater contamination; 
e.  If a SWPPP is required to be implemented, the SWPPP shall include concrete washout areas on the associated map. 
(10)  Vehicular traffic onto and off of the construction site shall be prohibited during rainy conditions or when muddy conditions exist, unless measures are in place that prevent mud from being tracked offsite. 
(11)  All best management practices shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the details and specifications listed in the NCTCOG iSWM Criteria Manual. 
(12)  All plans and specifications that are prepared for the construction of site improvements shall illustrate and describe the best management practices that will be implemented at the construction site. The city may withhold any permit or approval necessary to commence or continue construction, if it determines that the best management practices are inadequate or inappropriate for the project. If the city observes upon a construction site inspection that the best management practices described in the plans and specifications are absent or ineffective at controlling or reducing the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with clearing, grading, excavation, or any other construction activities to the maximum extent practicable, the operator, owner or contractor will be notified, in writing. The operator, owner or contractor shall initiate repairs to deficient best management practices within seven calendar days of receiving notification. If no corrective measures have been initiated within seven calendar days of receiving notification of the deficiencies, the city may escalate enforcement actions including, but not limited to, issuance of a warning citation or citation, revocation or suspension of a development permit or building permit, or withholding issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final acceptance. If existing best management practices require repairs or modifications, or if additional best management practices are necessary, an implementation schedule (including a reasonable completion date) shall be developed and, wherever possible, those changes shall be implemented prior to the next storm event. If implementation before the next anticipated storm event is impracticable, these changes shall be implemented as soon as possible thereafter. If the deficient or absent best management practice is causing or allowing a discharge of a harmful quantity of any substance, as determined by the control authority, the operator, owner or contractor shall implement an interim control measure, or cease the activity associated with the discharge until the corrective action has been completed. 
(13)  The operator, owner or contractor shall make every reasonable effort to prevent dirt and sediment from accumulating on paved or impervious surfaces and locations where offsite discharge would occur during storm events. If installing structural control measures in these areas is impracticable, alternative measures such as frequent sweeping shall be implemented. 
(14)  If fuels, oils or other chemicals are used or stored on-site, these materials shall be used and stored in such a manner that discharge into the MS4, water in the state or the environment is prevented. In the event of a discharge of these materials, the responsible party shall remove all contamination and restore the area prior to the next storm event or as soon as possible thereafter. 
(15)  For large and small construction activities, the operator shall be responsible for the design, installation and maintenance of all stormwater pollution prevention practices in accordance with the construction permit. For all other construction activities, the owner or contractor shall be responsible for the design, installation and maintenance of all stormwater pollution prevention practices in accordance with the NCTCOG iSWM Criteria Manual. The operator, owner or contractor shall be responsible for the maintenance of all stormwater pollution prevention practices from the time of commencement of construction activities until final stabilization has been completed on all disturbed areas or until a new operator, owner or contractor has assumed control over the construction activity. For large construction activities, the operator shall retain responsibility until the construction activity qualifies for termination of permit coverage and a notice of termination has been submitted, in addition to any other requirements set forth in this article. 
(e)  Site inspection and monitoring requirements. 
(1)  Personnel (provided by the operator) shall inspect disturbed areas of any construction site that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, discharge locations, and structural controls for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the MS4 or water in the state. Personnel conducting these inspections shall be knowledgeable of the construction permit, familiar with the construction site, and knowledgeable of the SWPPP for the site. Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWPPP shall be inspected to ensure that they are operating correctly. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of offsite sediment tracking. Inspections shall be conducted at least once every 14 calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm event of 0.5 inches or greater. As an alternative to the above-described inspection schedule, the SWPPP may be developed to require that these inspections will occur at least once every seven calendar days. If this alternative schedule is developed, the inspection shall occur on a specifically defined day (e.g. an inspection occurs every Tuesday), regardless of whether or not there has been a rainfall event since the previous inspection. The specifically defined day, on which the inspections will occur, shall be documented in the SWPPP. The SWPPP shall clearly identify which inspection schedule will be implemented. The inspection may occur on either schedule provided that the SWPPP reflects the current schedule and that any changes in the schedule are conducted in accordance with the requirements of the construction permit. Where construction sites have been finally or temporarily stabilized, inspections shall be conducted at least once every month. In the event of flooding or other uncontrollable situations which prohibit access to the inspection sites, inspections shall be conducted as soon as access is practicable. 
(2)  The SWPPP shall be modified based on the results of inspections, as necessary, to better control pollutants in stormwater runoff. Revisions to the SWPPP shall be completed within seven calendar days following the inspection, or receiving written notification from the control authority. If existing BMPs are modified or if additional BMPs are necessary, an implementation schedule shall be described in the SWPPP and, wherever possible, those changes shall be implemented prior to the next storm event. If implementation before the next anticipated storm event is impracticable, these changes shall be implemented as soon as practicable. Any claims that implementation is not practicable before the next storm shall be verified and approved by the control authority. 
(3)  A report summarizing the scope of the inspection, names and qualifications of personnel making the inspection, the dates of the inspection, and major observations relating to the implementation of the SWPPP shall be made and retained as part of the SWPPP. Major observations should include: 
a.  The locations of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from the construction site; 
b.  Locations of BMPs that need to be maintained; 
c.  Locations of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate for a particular location; and 
d.  Locations where additional BMPs are needed. 
Actions taken as a result of inspections shall be described within, and retained as part of the SWPPP. Reports shall identify any incidents of noncompliance. Where a report does not identify any incidents of noncompliance, the report shall contain a certification that the construction site is in compliance with the SWPPP and the construction permit. The operator shall store the inspection reports with the SWPPP and make those reports available for onsite review within seven days from the date that the inspection was conducted. All inspection reports which are not included in the SWPPP, and which are greater than seven days old, shall be made available onsite within 24 hours of request by the control authority. 
(4)  All discharges of stormwater runoff from concrete batch plants that qualify for coverage, and that are authorized to discharge stormwater under the provisions of the construction permit, shall be monitored for compliance with benchmark values in accordance with such permit. Results of monitoring for determining compliance with benchmark values shall be recorded and, where applicable, reported to the permitting authority in accordance with the construction permit. The operator shall make records of discharge monitoring readily available to the control authority, upon request. 
(5)  It shall be the responsibility of the operator, owner or contractor to clean any spills or discharges of fuel, oil or any other chemicals used or stored at the construction site. If any harmful quantity of fuels, oils or other chemicals is spilled or discharged, the operator, owner or contractor shall provide documentation indicating that the area has been cleaned and restored in accordance with state and federal rules and regulations. 
(f)  Terminating authorization to discharge stormwater. Operators who have submitted an NOI shall terminate authorization for discharges associated with construction activity by submitting a notice of termination (NOT) in accordance with the requirements of the construction permit. The NOT shall be submitted to the permitting authority, and a copy of the signed and certified NOT provided to the control authority within 30 days after: 
(1)  Final stabilization has been achieved on all portions of the construction site that are the responsibility of the operator; or 
(2)  Another permitted operator has assumed control over all areas of the construction site that have not been finally stabilized; and 
(3)  All silt fences and other temporary erosion controls have been removed, scheduled for removal as defined in the SWPPP, or transferred to a new operator, if the new operator has sought permit coverage. Operators are not required to remove, or schedule the removal of, erosion controls, which are designed to remain in place for an indefinite period, such as mulches and erosion mats. Operators of small construction activities shall also meet the requirements listed in subsections (1)-(3), above in order to consider their automatic permit coverage to be terminated. Notification of the termination of automatic permit coverage shall be made to the control authority in accordance with the requirements of the construction permit. 
Operators of large and small construction activities shall remove the NOI and/or construction site notice immediately following termination of permit coverage. 
(g)  Final acceptance and certificate of occupancy. The public works department shall not recommend that small or large construction activities be approved for final acceptance unless those construction activities are in compliance with this article. If the operator seeking final acceptance will not be associated with any further construction activity after final acceptance is granted, the construction activity shall also meet the requirements necessary to qualify for termination of permit coverage. A final certificate of occupancy shall not be recommended until final stabilization has been achieved on all disturbed areas, all potential pollutants associated with the construction activity have been removed, and the construction activity meets any additional requirements necessary to qualify for termination of permit coverage. A final certificate of occupancy may be granted prior to meeting the above conditions, on a case-by-case basis, provided that the signatory authority certifies in writing that the construction activity will maintain compliance with the construction permit and/or this article until the construction activity has been completed. Recommendation for final acceptance or a final certificate of occupancy for all other construction activities shall not be made until final stabilization has been achieved on all disturbed areas. Final acceptance may be recommended, where final stabilization has not yet occurred, provided that either the disturbed soils have been temporarily stabilized or a new operator, owner or contractor has assumed control over the construction activity and the construction site will not remain inactive for more than 21 days. Final acceptance and a final certificate of occupancy may also be withheld in the event of outstanding violations or enforcement actions. A final certificate of occupancy may be granted prior to meeting the above conditions, on a case-by-case basis, provided that the signatory authority provides written documentation to the control authority certifying that the construction activity will maintain compliance with the construction permit and/or this article until the construction activity has been completed. 
(h)  Signatory authority. All applications, notices, reports, and all other applicable documents required under the construction permit shall be signed in accordance with the signatory requirements set forth in title 30 § 305.44 of the Texas Administrative Code as it now exists or as hereafter amended. The authority to sign documents other than the NOI, NOT, NOC letter and construction site notice may be delegated to other qualified personnel provided that the requirements set forth in title 30 § 305.128 of the Texas Administrative Code, as it now exists or as hereafter amended, are met. All operators, owners and contractors shall designate an authorized representative on a form provided by the control authority. The authorized representative will be the point of contact for all pollution prevention matters for the site. If no authorized representative is designated for a small or large construction activity, the signatory authority for the NOI or construction site notice shall be the default authorized representative. For all other construction activities, the default authorized representative shall be the property owner. All communications and enforcement actions shall be addressed to the authorized representative. 
(i)  Recordkeeping requirements. The operator shall retain a copy of the SWPPP, all reports, notices, applications, monitoring and inspection records and other documents required by the construction permit or this article, for the construction site, and records of all data used to complete the NOI, for a period of at least three years from the date that an NOT is submitted. For activities that are not required to submit an NOT (e.g. small construction activities that are not required to submit an NOI), records shall be retained for a period of at least three years from the date that either: final stabilization has been achieved on all portions of the construction site that are the responsibility of the operator; or another permitted operator has assumed control over all areas of the construction site that have not been finally stabilized. The operator shall make all documents and data, required by the construction permit or this article, readily available to the control authority, upon request.

    The standards and criteria contained within this section are deemed to be minimum standards and shall apply to all new construction, or any building expansion construction occurring within the city. The provisions of this section shall be administered by the building official or his designee. 
    No permits shall be issued for building, paving, grading or construction until a detailed landscape plan is submitted and approved by the city. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building or structure, all screening, buffering, and landscaping shall be in place in accordance with the landscape plan. 
    In any case in which a certificate of occupancy is sought at a season of the year in which the city horticulturist determines that it would be impractical to plant trees, shrubs or grass, or to lay turf, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the building official provided a letter of agreement from the property owner is submitted stating when the installation shall occur. All landscaping required by the landscaping plan shall be installed within six months of the date of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
    If at any time after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the approved landscaping is found to be in nonconformance to the standards and criteria of this section, the building official or designee shall issue notice to the owner, citing the violation and describing what action is required to comply with this article. The owner, tenant or agent shall have 30 days from date of said notice to restore the landscaping as required.

    Landscape Edge: At least 75 percent of the frontage of parking lots, adjacent to a public right-of-way and within the street yard (on private property), shall be screened from public streets with evergreen shrubs attaining a minimum height of three feet, earthen berm, or a low masonry wall of equal height. The minimum width of the landscape edge shall be five feet. Within this landscaped edge, shrubs (five gallon minimum) shall be planted at a four feet spacing. Use of a wall for parking lot screening should be accompanied with landscape planting in the form of low shrubs and ground cover to soften the appearance of the wall. (See Figures #1 and #2) In cases of extreme grade differential between the street grade and private property, the building official has the authority to modify and/or eliminate the berm requirement, or accept an alternative screening arrangement that would accomplish the same goal. 
    Necessary driveways, sidewalks, lead walks, accessibility ways/ramps from the public right-of-way shall be permitted through all required landscaping in accordance with city regulations. 
    Parking Lot: Any parking area which contains more than 20 parking spaces shall provide interior landscaping in addition to the required landscape edge. Landscape areas within parking lots should generally be at least one parking space in size, with no landscape area less than 50 square feet in area. Landscape areas shall be no less than five feet wide. There shall be a landscaped area with at least one small tree within 60 feet of every parking space. There shall be a minimum of one small tree planted in the parking area for every 15 parking spaces. Within parking lots, landscape areas should be located to define parking areas and assist in clarifying appropriate circulation patterns. A landscape island shall be located at the terminus of all parking rows, and should contain at least one small tree. All landscape areas shall be protected by a monolithic curb or wheel stops and remain free of trash, litter, and car bumper overhangs. Large trees may be planted in parking lot areas as long as sufficient permeable surface is provided for the ultimate drip line of the mature tree. (See Figures #3 and #4). 
    Where an existing parking area is altered or expanded to increase the number of parking spaces to more than 20, interior landscaping shall be provided on the new portion of the lot in accordance with the above standards. 
    Residential Adjacency: 
(A)  A landscaped area of at least ten feet shall be provided, planted with one large tree for each 30 linear feet or portion thereof of adjacent exposure. See Figure #5 for perimeter landscape area example. 
(B)  A solid brick or masonry screening wall (reinforced concrete, concrete block, concrete panels) of not less than six feet nor more than eight feet in height above finish grade shall be erected on the property line. Masonry walls shall be a minimum of five inches thick, with a foundation, and shall be designed by a licensed professional engineer. In cases of extreme grades, elevations, or drainage ways at the property line, the director shall have the authority to cause the wall to be built at the most advantageous location on the property to provide a visual barrier. 
    Miscellaneous: 
(A)  Any permeable surface not occupied by trees, shrubs, planting beds, signs or other permitted fixtures shall be planted with turf or other living ground cover. 
(B)  It is encouraged to plant a variety of ornamental trees and flowers in addition to the required plantings. 
(C)  Rigid compliance with these landscaping requirements shall not be such as to cause visibility obstructions and/or blind corners at intersections. See section 9, article XIV-E, Landscape Requirements and Figure #6 for additional information."

ARTICLE XII-L. - DOWNTOWN DUNCANVILLE DISTRICT "DD" 

Section 1. - General purpose. 
    The purpose of the Downtown Duncanville District is to support a pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use urban development environment, with convenient access to rail transit, shopping, employment, housing, and neighborhood retail services. The intent is to revitalize Duncanville's Main Street to be the center of life in the community. Therefore, an efficient, compact land use pattern; encouraging pedestrian activity; reducing the reliance on private automobiles; promoting a more functional and attractive community through the use of recognized principles of urban design; and allowing property owners flexibility in land use, while prescribing a high level of detail in building design and form are encouraged by the Downtown Duncanville District. The Downtown Duncanville District is intended to implement the vision laid out in the Downtown Duncanville Master Plan including maximizing development opportunities in the vicinity of the future rail transit stop at Center Street. Specifically, the zoning district will guide the private development decisions on a market based approach with flexibility in use and density. 
    The Downtown Duncanville District provides simple and clear graphic standards for the location, height, and building elements to achieve good urban design. 
(Ord. No. 2055, § 1, 6-17-08) 
Section 2. - Downtown Duncanville Master Plan. 
    The Downtown Duncanville Master Plan establishes the community vision for the redevelopment of city's downtown into a vibrant center of community life. The Master Plan builds on "Our Visions", Main Street Duncanville established 2003.

(2)  The Downtown Duncanville District is composed of following major elements: 
(A)  Downtown Regulating Plan: The frontage types are provided herein and establish the development standards for all lots within the district including: 
(1)  Frontage types - The frontage type establishes the building standards including height, bulk, building and parking location, and functional design for all lots within the Downtown Duncanville District. The frontage types in Section 4 classify all lots within the Downtown Duncanville Master Plan area into one of five (5) frontage types. The different frontage types are based on historic and regional architectural traditions to create a built environment that is consistent with the vision for Downtown Street, Duncanville. 
(2)  Build-to lines and zones (BTL/BTZ) - The Build-to line or zone establishes the location on the lot where the building shall be built. 
(3)  Parking setback lines (PSL) - The Parking setback line shall establish the location behind which surface parking is permitted on each lot, and 
(4)  Streetscape standards - The Streetscape standards shall establish a consistent character along Main Street that relates private development along the street to its public improvements. Public improvements along Main Street shall include the placement of street trees, sidewalks, pedestrian amenities, on-street parking, configuration of travel lanes, and the relationship between the street and buildings. 
(B)  Downtown Duncanville District Text: The Downtown Duncanville District Text shall enumerate the use and development standards with text and graphics including frontage, streetscape, landscape, architectural, signage, lighting, and all related standards for all private development. 
(C)  The development standards under Appendix A of the City of Duncanville Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, as amended, shall not apply to the Downtown Duncanville District except as specifically referenced herein. Development standards not addressed in this ordinance shall be governed by the City of Duncanville Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance to the extent they are not in conflict with the intent of the Downtown Duncanville District. 

(Ord. No. 2055, § 1, 6-17-08) 
Section 4. - General district standards. 
(1)  Nonconforming uses and buildings: Nonconforming uses shall be governed by Article XVI of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, as amended. Regardless of transfer of ownership, existing buildings that do not conform to the provisions of this District may continue in use as they are until the building is reconstructed or substantially modified such that the collective reconstructions or modifications to the building exterior or building façade within any five (5) year period are valued at more than either $50,000 or a total of fifty (50)% of the assessed value of the structure in the most recently certified tax rolls, whichever is greater. In addition, for all improvements over either $50,000 or 50% of the assessed value the structure, any changes to nonconforming buildings that do not comply with Section 6, Development Standards shall only be allowed if alternative compliance is approved in accordance with this Section 4, subsection (6), Alternative Compliance. 
(2)  Exemption. 
(A)  The provisions of this Ordinance shall not require a current property owner or occupant to conform to the development regulations as set forth herein for any structure, lot or property currently owned or occupied and used as of the effective date of this ordinance, if and only if, such property or structure is destroyed by an act of nature, such as tornado, flooding or natural disaster or by fire, not the cause of intentional negligence or gross negligence of the owner or occupant. 
(B)  The provisions of this exemption shall expire on the tenth anniversary date of enactment of this ordinance. 
(3)  Pedestrian Orientation: In order to facilitate walkability and livability, Main Street and intersecting streets within the Downtown Duncanville District shall provide accessible sidewalks with street trees.

The future edge of pavement as shown the adopted Downtown Master Plan shall be the basis for establishing the build-to zones, lines and parking setback lines along Main Street and any other street in the Downtown Duncanville District that requires public street improvements. If the existing street does not require any public improvements, the build-to zone, line and parking setback lines shall all be measured from the property/R-O-W line along that street frontage. The City Manager or designee may revise the build-to lines, zones, and parking setbacks to accommodate required streetscape improvements based upon a Council approved Streetscape Plan and survey. 
(3)  Landscaping. New landscaping or substantial reconfiguration of existing landscaping on all lots within the Downtown Duncanville District shall comply with the following standards: 
(A)  Landscaping Requirements for Surface Parking Lots: Where an existing off-street surface parking area is altered or expanded to increase the number of parking spaces to more than 20, interior landscaping shall be provided on the new portion of the lot in accordance with the following standards.

ARTICLE XIII-B. - "SU" SPECIFIC USE PERMIT REGULATIONS*** 

Section 1. - Specific uses. 
    The purpose of this district is to allow certain uses in districts that under most circumstances would not be compatible or have not been allowed with other permitted uses, but with certain conditions and development restrictions may be allowed. If a particular use is not listed or defined in any other specific zoning category, a specific use permit may be granted for such use. 
    The city council by an affirmative vote may, after public hearing and proper notice to all parties affected, and after recommendations from the planning and zoning commission and containing such requirements and safeguards as are necessary to protect adjoining property, grant a specific use permit by ordinance. 
    Application shall be accompanied by a site plan (see article XIV-H) drawn to scale and showing the general arrangement of the project, together with essential requirements such as off-street parking facilities; size, height, residential proximity slope, construction materials, landscaping, and locations of buildings and the uses to be permitted, location and construction of signs; means of ingress and egress to public streets; the type of visual screening such as walls, plantings and fences, and the relationship of the intended use to all existing properties and land uses in all directions to a minimum distance of 200 feet. The city Development Review Committee, planning and zoning commission or city council may require additional information, traffic impact study, or drawings (such as building floor plans), operating data and expert evaluation or testimony concerning the location, function and characteristics of any building or use proposed as deemed necessary to arrive at a decision. 
Section 2. - Specific use permit regulations. 
(1)  In considering an application for a specific use permit, the city plan commission and the city council shall consider the following: 
  The proposed use is consistent and compatible with the adjacent land use and zoning. 
  The proposed use is consistent with the architecture and characteristics of the adjacent properties. 
  The proposed use may promote innovative use of modern development concepts, without having an adverse impact on adjacent properties. 
  The proposed use is consistent with the goals and objectives of the City of Duncanville. 
  The proposed use is an enhancement or improvement beyond the minimum standards set forth by the City of Duncanville Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance. 
  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the general health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
  The proposed use would stabilize and improve property values within the City of Duncanville. 
  The proposed use would protect and enhance the city's attractiveness to residents, businesses, tourists, and visitors. 
  The proposed use would strengthen and help diversify the economy of the City of Duncanville. 
In recommending that a specific use permit for the premises under consideration be granted, the city plan commission and the city council shall consider that such uses are harmonious and adaptable to building structures and uses of abutting property and other property in the vicinity of the premises under consideration, and shall make recommendations as to requirements for paving (material/structure) of streets, alleys and sidewalks, means of ingress and egress to public streets, provisions for drainage, adequate off-street parking, screening, landscaping and open space, heights of structures, residential proximity slopes, special setbacks, and compatibility of buildings. 
(2)  In granting a Specific Use Permit, the planning and zoning commission may recommend and city council may impose conditions which shall be complied with by the owner or grantee before a certificate of occupancy may be issued by the building official for use of the building on such property pursuant to such specific use permit and such conditions precedent to the granting of the certificate of occupancy. Said special conditions shall be set forth in the amending ordinance granting the specific use permit. 
(3)  A building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be applied for and secured within six months from the time of granting the specific use permit. If an application for a building permit or a certificate of occupancy has not been applied for and secured after six months from the date of approval, the city council may direct the planning and zoning commission to call a public hearing to consider a change of zoning on the subject property. 
(4)  No building, premise, or land used under a specific use permit may be enlarged, modified, structurally altered, or otherwise significantly changed from the approved site plan unless an amended Specific Use permit is granted for such enlargement, modification, structural alteration, or change. 
    Minor changes or alterations may be approved by the director of public works. 
(5)  The board of adjustment shall not have jurisdiction to grant exceptions to the conditions contained in the specific use permit. 
(6)  The specific use permit may be issued for an unlimited or limited period of time. Prior to the expiration of a Special Use Permit with a limited time period, the owner may apply for an extension as provided below. 
(A)  As part of an SUP Ordinance or amendment, the city council may declare that an SUP is eligible for automatic renewal pursuant to this section. Automatic renewal is an alternative to the standard method of renewing an SUP by amending the SUP Ordinance. In order for automatic renewal to occur, the property owner or his representative must file a complete application for automatic renewal with the director after the one hundred eightieth day but before the one hundred twentieth day before the expiration of the current SUP time period. The applicant shall pay such fee as may be fixed by city council resolution. The renewal, if granted, shall be for a five-year extension of the SUP. The SUP may be extended in the same manner for three consecutive five-year periods. 
(B)  Automatic renewal does not result in an amendment to the SUP Ordinance. An applicant seeking to change the SUP conditions or to otherwise amend the SUP Ordinance must go through the procedure for obtaining a new specific use permit. 
(C)  An application for automatic renewal must be filed with the director on a form furnished by the city for that purpose. The applicant or its representative shall state that all existing SUP conditions have been complied with, and that no changes to the conditions or other SUP Ordinance provisions are being requested. 
(D)  Failure to timely file a complete application required under paragraph (A) renders the SUP ineligible for automatic renewal. The city council may, however, reinstate an SUP's eligibility for future automatic renewals as part of a new SUP Ordinance or ordinance amendment. 
(E)  Upon the filing of a complete application for automatic renewal, the director shall send written notice to owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the area governed by the SUP. The notice must state that the SUP is eligible for automatic renewal and may be automatically renewed without further notice. 
(F)  If the owners of 20 percent or more of the land within 200 feet of the area governed by the SUP file a written protest against the automatic renewal in accordance with this paragraph, the director shall forward the application to the city planning commission and city council for further action. Written protest against an automatic renewal must be filed with the director before 5:00 p.m. of the twenty-first calendar day after the date the notice is mailed. A protest sent through the mail must be received by the director before the deadline. If the deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or official City holiday, then the protest must be filed before noon of the following working day. To the extent that they do not conflict with this subsection. 
(G)  After the deadline for filing written protest has passed the director shall review the condition of the SUP and determine whether the conditions have been met. If the director determines that the conditions have not been met, he shall forward the application to the city planning commission and city council for further action. If the conditions have been met, the director shall notify the applicant in writing that the permit has been renewed. 
(H)  "Further action" as that term is used in paragraphs (F) and (G) means that the director shall schedule the application for public hearings before both the city planning commission and the city council. Notice of the public hearings must be given as would be required by law for a change in zoning district classification. The city planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council regarding the proposed renewal based on staff reports, field inspections, and the evidence presented at its public hearing. 
(I)  In connection with an application that has been forwarded to it by the director pursuant to paragraph (F) or (G), the city council may: 
(1)  Pass an amending ordinance to repeal the SUP's eligibility for automatic renewal, or to supplement, remove, or amend any of the conditions or other provisions in the SUP Ordinance; or 
(2)  Take no action and thereby allow the SUP to automatically renew as of a matter of law. 
(J)  No renewal or expiration of a SUP may occur while the application is pending before the city planning commission or city council. If the application is pending at the end of the current time period stated in the SUP Ordinance, the time period shall be extended as a matter of law. 
(1)  The day following the next succeeding official agenda meeting of the city council after the city council makes its final decision on the application; or 
(2)  If the council votes to pass an amending ordinance, until the effective date of the amending ordinance. 
(K)  The renewal of an SUP that is eligible for automatic renewal occurs as a matter of law at the end of the current time period as stated in the SUP Ordinance, or as extended pursuant to paragraph (J). Unless otherwise specified in the SUP Ordinance, an automatic renewal is for a period of five years. 
(L)  An SUP that is automatically renewed pursuant to this subsection may continue to be automatically renewed for not more than three five-year renewal periods so long as the owner or its representative continues to timely file the application for automatic renewal required under paragraph (A). Failure to timely file this application during any renewal period renders the SUP ineligible for further automatic renewal. The city council may, however, reinstate the SUP's eligibility for future automatic renewals as part of a new SUP Ordinance or ordinance amendment. 
(M)  Should an applicant desire to continue a specific use after the initial time period and all available extensions expire, a new application, complete with filing fees, site plan, drawings, background data, etc., must be filed. The city council by an affirmative vote may, after public hearing and proper notice to all parties affected and after recommendations from the planning and zoning commission, grant the specific use permit. 
(7)  When the city council authorizes granting a specific use permit, the zoning map shall be amended according to its legend to indicate that the affected area has conditional and limited uses, and said amendment is to indicate the appropriate zoning district for the approved use and prefixed by an "SU" designation. 
Section 3. - Use regulations. 
    Uses not listed or defined in any other specific zoning category contained in the City of Duncanville Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance shall be authorized by a specific use permit by ordinance. 
Section 4. - Development. 
    Following the issuance of a specific use permit, the building official shall insure that if the development is undertaken, it is completed in compliance with said permit. If the development has not been completed in accordance with the approved site plan within 12 months after the issuance of the building permit, the city council may direct the planning and zoning commission to call a public hearing to consider a change of zoning on the subject property.

--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1881, § 2, adopted Mar. 4, 2004, repealed the former App. A, Art. XIV, §§ 1-15, and enacted a new App. A, Art. XIV as set out herein. The former Art. XIV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 601, § 1, adopted Aug. 6, 1974. 

Section 1. - General purpose and description. 
    The City Council of the City of Duncanville, Texas, after public hearing and proper notice to all parties affected and after recommendation from the planning and zoning commission may authorize the creation of a Planned Development District. 
    The Planned Development District is a district which accommodates planned associations of uses developed as integral land use units such as industrial districts, offices, commercial or service centers, shopping centers, residential developments of multiple or mixed housing including attached single-family dwellings or any appropriate combination of uses which, may be planned, developed, or operated as integral land use units either by a single owner or combination of owners. A Planned Development District may be used to permit new or innovative concepts in land utilization not permitted by other zoning districts in this ordinance. While greater flexibility is given to allow special conditions or restrictions which would not otherwise allow the development to occur, procedures are established herein to ensure against misuse of increased flexibility. 
    In considering an application for a Planned Development District the city plan commission and the city council shall consider the following: 
 The proposed use or development is consistent and compatible with the adjacent land use and zoning. 
 The proposed use or development is consistent with the architecture and characteristics of the adjacent properties. 
 The proposed use or development may promote innovative use of modern development concepts, without having an adverse impact on adjacent properties. 
 The proposed use or development is consistent with the goals and objectives of the City of Duncanville. 
 The proposed use or development is an enhancement or improvement beyond the minimum standards set forth by the City of Duncanville Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance. 
 The proposed use or development will not be detrimental to the general health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
 The proposed use or development would stabilize and improve property values within the City of Duncanville. 
 The proposed use or development would protect and enhance the city's attractiveness to residents, businesses, tourists, and visitors. 
 The proposed use or development would strengthen and help diversify the economy of the City of Duncanville.

(A)  As part of an SUP Ordinance or amendment, the city council may declare that an SUP is eligible for automatic renewal pursuant to this section. Automatic renewal is an alternative to the standard method of renewing an SUP by amending the SUP Ordinance. In order for automatic renewal to occur, the property owner or his representative must file a complete application for automatic renewal with the director after the one hundred eightieth day but before the one hundred twentieth day before the expiration of the current SUP time period. If a fee is required, the application is not considered "filed" until the fee is paid. The fee shall be determined by city council resolution. The renewal, if granted, shall be for a five-year extension of the SUP. The SUP may be extended in the same manner for three consecutive five-year periods. 
(B)  Automatic renewal does not result in an amendment to the SUP Ordinance. An applicant seeking to change the SUP conditions or to otherwise amend the SUP Ordinance must go through the procedure for obtaining a new specific use permit. 
(C)  An application for automatic renewal must be filed with the director on a form furnished by the city for that purpose. The applicant or its representative shall state that all existing SUP conditions have been complied with, and that no changes to the conditions or other SUP Ordinance provisions are being requested. 
(D)  Failure to timely file a complete application required under paragraph (A) renders the SUP ineligible for automatic renewal. The city council may, however, reinstate an SUP's eligibility for future automatic renewals as part of a new SUP ordinance or ordinance amendment. 
(E)  Upon the filing of a complete application for automatic renewal, the director shall send written notice to owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the area governed by the SUP. The notice must state that the SUP is eligible for automatic renewal and may be automatically renewed without further notice. 
(F)  If the owners of 20 percent or more of the land within 200 feet of the area governed by the SUP file a written protest against the automatic renewal in accordance with this paragraph, the director shall forward the application to the planning and zoning commission and city council for further action. Written protest against an automatic renewal must be filed with the director before 5:00 P.M. of the twenty-first calendar day after the date the notice is mailed. A protest sent through the mail must be received by the director before the deadline. If the deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or official City holiday, then the protest must be filed before noon of the following working day. To the extent that they do not conflict with this subsection. 
(G)  After the deadline for filing written protest has passed the director shall review the condition of the SUP and determine whether the conditions have been met. If the director determines that the conditions have not been met, he shall forward the application to the planning and zoning commission and city council for further action. If the conditions have been met the director shall notify the applicant in writing that the permit has been renewed. 
(H)  "Further action" as that term is used in paragraphs (F) and (G) means that the director shall schedule the application for public hearings before both the planning and zoning commission and the city council. Notice of the public hearings must be given as would be required by law for a change in zoning district classification. The commission shall make a recommendation to the city council regarding the proposed renewal based on staff reports, field inspections, and the evidence presented at its public hearing. 
(I)  In connection with an application that has been forwarded to it by the director pursuant to paragraph (F) or (G), the city council may: 
(1)  Pass an amending ordinance to repeal the SUP's eligibility for automatic renewal, or to supplement, remove, or amend any of the conditions or other provisions in the SUP ordinance; or 
(2)  Take no action and thereby allow the SUP to automatically renew as of a matter of law. 
(J)  No renewal or expiration of a SUP may occur while the application is pending before the planning and zoning commission or city council. If the application is pending at the end of the current time period stated in the SUP ordinance, the time period shall be extended as a matter of law. 
(1)  The day following the next succeeding official agenda meeting of the city council after the city council makes its final decision on the application; or 
(2)  If the Council votes to pass an amending ordinance, until the effective date of the amending ordinance. 
(K)  The renewal of an SUP that is eligible for automatic renewal occurs as a matter of law at the end of the current time period as stated in the SUP ordinance, or as extended pursuant to paragraph (J). Unless otherwise specified in the SUP ordinance, an automatic renewal is for a period of five years. 
(L)  An SUP that is automatically renewed pursuant to this subsection may continue to be automatically renewed for not more than three five year renewal periods so long as the owner or its representative continues to timely file the application for automatic renewal required under paragraph (A). Failure to timely file this application during any renewal period renders the SUP ineligible for further automatic renewal. The city council may, however, reinstate the SUP's eligibility for future automatic renewals as part of a new SUP ordinance or ordinance amendment. 
(M)  This subsection does not impair the ability of the commission or city council to call a public hearing on its own motion for the purpose of passing an amending ordinance to repeal a SUP's eligibility for automatic renewal, or to supplement, remove, or amend any of the conditions or other provisions in an SUP ordinance. 
(3)  Towers. 
(A)  In addition to any information required for applications for an SUP pursuant to article XIII-B of the Zoning Ordinance, applicants for a SUP for a tower shall complete the application as prescribed in section 4(1) and shall submit the following prepared by professionals, licensed to practice their respective disciplines in the State of Texas:

(6)  Method of fencing, illumination, and finish. 
(B)  Availability of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures, or Alternative Technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city council that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the use of an additional tower or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed system needs. An applicant shall submit information requested by the city council related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed system may consist of any of the following: 
(1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
(3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed system. 
(4)  The applicant's proposed system would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed system.

(1)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from residential zoning, or uses. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound, to be approved by the director. 
(2)  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer, as approved by the director. 
(3)  If the natural growth in (2) is removed or is damaged, the director may require equivalent landscaping per (1). 
(4)  Antennas. 
(A)  In addition to any information required for applications for specific use permits pursuant to article III-B of the Zoning Ordinance, applicants for a specific use permit for an antenna shall complete the application as prescribed in section 4(1) and shall submit the following prepared for professionals, licensed to practice their respective disciplines in the State of Texas: 
(1)  A scaled site plan clearly indicating, but not limited to, the uses and zoning, adjacent land uses and zoning (including when adjacent to other municipalities), adjacent roadways, proposed means of access, setbacks from property lines, elevation drawings of the proposed antenna and any other structures, easements, topography, parking, and other information deemed by the City of Duncanville to be necessary to assess compliance with the ordinance. 
(2)  Legal description of the parent tract and leased parcel (if applicable).

    Any tower or antenna that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such tower or antenna shall remove the same within 60 days of receipt of notice from the director notifying the owner of such abandonment. Failure to remove an abandoned tower or antenna within said 60 days shall be grounds to remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense, or by execution of the Performance Bond. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.

ARTICLE XIV-E. - LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS 

Section 1. - Purpose. 
(1)  Landscaping is accepted as adding value to property and is in the interest of the general welfare of the city. The objectives of this ordinance are as follows: 
(A)  To ensure that the local stock of trees and vegetation is preserved and replenished. 
(B)  To provide visual buffering and enhance the beautification of the city. 
(C)  To safeguard and enhance property values and to protect public and private investment. 
(D)  To conserve energy, water, and natural resources through the use of Xeriscape materials and strategies. 
(E)  To protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Therefore, landscaping is hereafter required of new development and altered construction as described in section 2, as well as the resultant of an owner initiated zoning change of developed property to a zoning district listed below. A common development which includes more than one lot shall be treated as one lot for the purpose of this article. Split ownership, planning in phases, construction in stages, or multiple building permits for a project shall not prevent it from being such a common development. 
(2)  This article shall not apply to the following: 
(A)  Single-family residences where only one such dwelling structure is constructed per lot, and 
(B)  Agricultural uses. 
    This article XIV-E shall apply only to the following zoning districts, to wit:

(1)  All required landscaped open areas shall be completely covered with living plant material. Landscaping materials such as wood chips and gravel may be used under trees, shrubs and other plants. 
(2)  Plant materials shall conform to the standards of the approved plant list for the City of Duncanville and the American Standard for Nursery Stock. Grass seed, sod, and other material shall be clean and reasonably free of weeds and noxious pests and insects. 
(3)  Trees shall have an average spread of crown of greater than 15 feet at maturity. Trees having a lesser average mature crown of 15 feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of 15 feet crown of spread. Large trees shall be a minimum of three inches in caliper (measured 24 inches above the ground) and seven feet in height at time of planting. Small trees shall be a minimum of one inch in caliper and five feet in height. The above requirements are for new trees that are proposed to satisfy landscaping requirements. See chapter 12, article XVII, section 12-146, Duncanville Code of Ordinances for "replacement tree" requirements. 
(4)  Shrubs not of the dwarf variety shall be a minimum of three feet in height when measured immediately after planting. Hedges, where installed for screening purposes, shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual screen which will be five feet high within two years after time of planting, or an effective height of five feet of berm and shrub height measured together. 
(5)  Vines not intended as ground cover shall be a minimum of two feet in height immediately after planting and may be used in conjunction with fences, screens, or walls to meet landscape screening requirements as set forth. 
(6)  Grass areas shall be sodded, plugged, sprigged, hydro-mulched or seeded except that solid sod shall be used in swales, earthen retention ponds, earthen berms or other areas subject to erosion. 
(7)  Ground covers used in lieu of grass in whole and in part shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and reasonably completed coverage within one year of planting. 
(8)  All required landscaped open space shall be provided with adequate and inconspicuous irrigation systems. Areas totaling less than ten square feet may be irrigated by other methods. Freeze cut-off monitors shall be provided. 
(9)  Any trees preserved on the site under consideration meeting the herein specifications may be credited toward meeting the tree requirement of any landscaping provision of this section according to the following table: 
Caliper of 
Existing Tree Credit Against 
Tree Requirement 4" to 5" 1.0 tree 6" to 12" 2.0 trees 12" to 24" 3.0 trees 24" or more 4.0 trees  
Mesquite, bois d'arc, thorny honey locust, hackberry, cottonwood, cedar, china-berry (common), native black willow, and native red/white mulberry trees are exceptions to the above and will receive no credit for tree preservation. Existing trees beyond 50 feet in any direction beyond the proposed and/or existing structure (or to the closest property line, whichever is less) shall also receive no credit. All other existing trees may receive credit if they are not on the city's approved plant material list but approved by the building official or designee. 
Should any required tree designated for preservation in the landscape plan die, be damaged, or be removed, the owner shall replace the tree in accordance with chapter 12, article XVII, section 12-146, of the Duncanville Code of Ordinances. 
(10)  No protected trees greater than six inches in caliper may be cut, destroyed or damaged on the development site until a tree preservation plan is approved and appropriate permits issued. 
(11)  Earthen berms shall have side slopes not to exceed 33.3 percent [three feet of horizontal distance for each one foot of height]. All berms shall contain necessary drainage provisions as may be required by the director of public works. 
(Ord. No. 1882, § 1, 3-2-04) 
Section 7. - Minimum landscaping requirements for nonresidential and apartments. 
(1)  All nonresidential properties and apartments shall have at least 20 percent of the street yard in permanent landscape area. (See Figures #1 and #2) The required landscaping shall consist of a mixture of plant materials consisting of grass and/or ground covers, plants, shrubbery and trees of a variety of sizes as approved on the landscape plan. The street yard shall be defined as the area between the building front and the front property line. For any facility that provides gasoline sales on site, there is required a minimum 15 percent landscape area for the entire site, including a 600 square foot landscape area at appropriate intersection corners, which can be counted toward the 15 percent requirement. 
(2)  A minimum 15-foot landscape buffer (interior parkway) adjacent to the right-of-way of any existing or proposed major thoroughfare street is required. Corner lots fronting two major thoroughfares shall be required to observe the 15-foot buffer on both street frontages. All other street frontages shall observe a minimum ten-foot landscape buffer. Developers shall be required to plant one large tree per 40 linear feet or portion thereof of street frontage. In areas where overhead utilities are present, substitute trees (a minimum one inch) in caliper and a minimum five feet tall) shall be planted per the Approved Plant List made a part of this article. 
For the purpose of this section, driveway widths, measured at the property line, may be excluded from the street frontage calculation. Trees may be grouped or clustered to facilitate site design. The landscaped portion of interior parkways may be included in the required landscape area percentage. The interior parkway is defined as that area on private property between the street right-of-way line and the curb of the parking area or building area. 
(3)  Landscape areas within parking lots should generally be at least one parking space in size, with no landscape area less than 50 square feet in area. Landscape areas shall be no less than five feet wide and shall equal a total of at least 25 square feet per parking space. There shall be a landscaped area with at least one small tree within 60 feet of every parking space located in an island parallel to the parking spaces (See Figure #9). There shall be a minimum of one small tree planted in the parking area for every ten parking spaces. Within parking lots, landscape areas should be located to define parking areas and assist in clarifying appropriate circulation patterns. A landscape island shall be located at the terminus of all parking rows, and should contain at least one small tree. All landscape areas shall be protected from car bumper overhangs by installing a monolithic curb with an adjacent two-foot (2') wide concrete mow strip or wheel stops and shall remain free of trash and liter. Where landscape areas are used as a stormwater control, in accordance with the most recently approved iSWM Criteria Manual, Chapter 21, Article III, as amended, of the Code of Ordinances, monolithic curbs may be eliminated. Large trees may be planted in parking lot areas as long as sufficient permeable surface is provided for the ultimate drip line of the mature tree. (See Figures #3 and #5). 
(4)  All existing trees which are to be preserved, whether in the parking lot or in the street yard, shall be provided with a permeable surface in the critical root zone of the tree. All new trees as defined in section 6(3) of this article shall be provided with a permeable surface under the ultimate drip line of the mature tree. 
(5)  At least 75 percent of the frontage of parking lots, adjacent to a public right-of-way and within the street yard, shall be screened from public streets with evergreen shrubs attaining a minimum height of three feet, earthen berm, or a low masonry wall of equal height. Use of a wall for parking lot screening should be accompanied with landscape planting in the form of low shrubs and ground cover to soften the appearance of the wall. (See Figure #7) In cases of extreme grade differential between the street grade and private property, the building official has the authority to modify and/or eliminate the berm requirement, or accept an alternative screening arrangement that would accomplish the same goal. 
(6)  Necessary driveways, sidewalks, lead walks, and accessibility ways/ramps from the public right-of-way shall be permitted through all required landscaping in accordance with city regulations. 
(7)  Whenever an off-street parking area or vehicular use area abuts an adjacent property line, a perimeter landscape area of at least five feet shall be maintained between the edge of the parking area and the adjacent property line. See Figure #4 for perimeter landscape area example. 
(8)  Whenever the adjacent property is used or zoned for residential use, a landscaped area of at least ten feet shall be provided, planted with one large tree for each 30 linear feet or portion thereof of adjacent exposure. See Figure #4 for perimeter landscape area example. 
(Ord. No. 1865, § 2, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 1882, § 1, 3-2-04; Ord. No. 2162, § 1, 11-1-11) 
Section 8. - Tree preservation. 
    Protected trees, which are not required to be removed and/or have been identified on the tree preservation plan to be preserved, must be clearly marked and protected under the following conditions: 
(1)  No materials intended for use in construction and no waste materials accumulated due to excavations or demolition shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone. 
(2)  No equipment shall be cleaned or other foreign materials deposited or allowed to flow overland within the critical root zone of a protected tree. This includes without limitation, paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or similar materials. 
(3)  No signs, wires or other objects, other than those of a protective nature shall be attached to any protected tree. However, lighting of a decorative nature may be attached to a protected tree. The lighting shall be attached in a manner as not to damage the protected tree. 
(4)  No vehicular and or construction traffic or parking shall take place within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree other than on an existing paved surface. This restriction does not apply to access within the critical root zone for purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for routine utility maintenance or emergency restoration of utility service or routine mowing operations. 
(5)  Grade changes shall be allowed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree only upon approval by the city. 
(6)  No paving with concrete or other approved impervious materials shall be placed within the critical root zone of a protected tree. However, paving may encroach up to five feet from the trunk upon approval by the city. 
(7)  In those situations where a protected tree is within 50 feet of a construction area, a protective fence, minimum of four feet in height, shall be erected and maintained outside of the critical root zone of each protected tree or tree group. The protective fencing shall only be required on the subject site if the critical root zone extends onto adjacent property. It is not the intent of this provision to prohibit the development of a site in accordance with paragraph (6) of this section. 
(8)  No person, directly or indirectly, shall prune, cut down, destroy, remove or move, or effectively destroy through damaging, any protected tree on city-owned property unless otherwise permitted. 
(Ord. No. 1882, § 1, 3-2-04) 
Section 9. - Sight distance and visibility. 
    Rigid compliance with these landscaping requirements shall not be such as to cause visibility obstructions and/or blind corners at intersections. Whenever an intersection of two or more public rights-of-way occurs, a triangular visibility area, as described below, shall be created. Landscaping within the triangular visibility area shall be designed to provide unobstructed cross-visibility at a level no higher than two and one-half feet. The triangular areas are: 
(1)  The areas of property on both sides of the intersection of an alley access way and public right-of-way shall have a triangular visibility area with two sides of each triangle being a minimum of ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the other two sides. 
(2)  The areas of property located at a corner formed by the intersection of two or more public rights-of-way shall have a triangular visibility area with two sides of each triangle being a minimum of 35 feet in length from the point of the intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the other two sides. (See Figure #6). 
    Landscaping, except required grass and low ground cover, shall not be located or planted within the public right-of-way. 
    In the event other visibility obstructions are apparent in the proposed landscape plan, as determined by the building official or city horticulturist, the landscape plan shall be resubmitted with the visibility obstructions removed, and plantings depicted elsewhere on the plan. 
(Ord. No. 1882, § 1, 3-2-04) 
Section 10. - Maintenance. 
    The owner, tenant and/or their agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping and irrigation system components. All required landscaping shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner at all times. This shall include, but not be limited to, mowing, edging, pruning, fertilizing, watering, weeding, and other such activities common to the maintenance of landscaping. 
    Landscaped areas shall be kept free of trash, litter, weeds, and other such material or plants not a part of the landscaping. All plant material shall be maintained in a healthy and growing condition as is appropriate for the season of the year. Plant materials which die within one year of being planted shall be replaced with plant material of similar variety and size, within 30 days of notification of the city. Time extensions may be granted by the building official if substantial evidence is presented to indicate abnormal circumstances beyond the control of the owner or his agent. 
(Ord. No. 1882, § 1, 3-2-04) 
Section 11. - Appeal of specific requirements. 
    Upon denial of a building permit based on landscaping requirements by the building official, an applicant may appeal in writing to the zoning board of adjustment for consideration of a variance to the provisions of this article. The zoning board of adjustment shall have no jurisdiction to grant a variance to section 9 or any other section dealing with sight distance and visibility. Whenever the applicant can show that a strict application of the terms of this article will impose upon him unusual or practical difficulties, or affect the architectural design of the property, and the zoning board of adjustment is satisfied that granting such variation or variance will not merely serve as a convenience but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship or difficulty to warrant a variance, and that the surrounding property will be properly protected and not damaged by the granting of such variance, the zoning board of adjustment may grant such variance upon such conditions as it may require. 
(Ord. No. 1882, § 1, 3-2-04) 
Section 12. - Process for appeal. 
(1)  After denial of a building permit for failure to meet the requirements of this article, an applicant may within 15 days from the date of such denial appeal to the zoning board of adjustment for a variance from the strict compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  An appeal fee as provided for in the fee schedule established by the city council shall accompany such application. 
(3)  Site plan drawings and elevations of the property shall accompany the application for a variance. 
(4)  All property owners within 200 feet of the subject property shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing and the subject matter of the hearing. Notice must be given to such property owners by mail at least ten days prior to the hearing by depositing such notice in the United States mail, postage paid. 
(5)  The zoning board of adjustment shall hear the appeal from the applicant, and may either deny the request or may grant such variance or variances from the provisions of this section as it deems appropriate under the circumstances presented to the zoning board of adjustment at such hearing. 
(6)  The decision of the zoning board of adjustment shall be final. After a decision has been made on an application for a variance by the zoning board of adjustment, an aggrieved person or the city may within ten days after such denial, appeal to a state court of proper jurisdiction in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in Section 211.010 of the Texas Local Government Code, as amended.

ARTICLE XIV-F. - RESIDENTIAL PROXIMITY SLOPE 

Section 1. - General. 
    Residential Proximity Slope. The Residential Proximity Slope is a plane projected upward and outward from every site of origination as defined in Subsection 3.3. See Figures 1, 2, and 3 for graphic depictions. When referring to residential proximity envelopes, all slopes in this ordinance are stated as vertical rise to horizontal run. Specifically, the envelope is projected from the point formed by the intersection of: 
(1)  The vertical plane extending through the boundary line (common property line) or right-of-way line of the site or origination; and 
(2)  The finished floor elevation at grade level of the restricted building or structure, or 
(3)  From natural grade of the restricted structure or building prior to fill, in situations where property is filled. 
Section 2. - Purpose. 
    The Residential Proximity Slope will be utilized to define the separation distance between a structure that is being utilized as a dwelling from adjacent property/structures of a nonresidential nature. The Residential Proximity Slope is applicable only in those zoning districts where it is listed as a specific requirement. 
    This article XIV-F shall apply only to the following zoning districts, to wit: 
    "C-1" Light Commercial District 
    "C-2" Heavy Commercial District 
    "I-1" Light Industrial District 
    "I-2" Heavy Industrial District 
Section 3. - Definition of terminology. 
(1)  Private property means any property not dedicated to public use, except that "private property" does not include the following: 
(A)  A private street or alley 
(B)  Property on which a utility or public service use such as a commercial radio or transmitting station, electrical generating plant, electrical substation, water tower, local utility, drainage easement, post office or government installation is being conducted as a main use 
(C)  A railroad right-of-way 
(D)  A cemetery or mausoleum 
(E)  A church 
(F)  A school 
(B)  Restricted building or structure means the building or structure whose height is restricted by a Residential Proximity Slope. 
(C)  Site of origination means any private property in: 
(1)  Single-family, Duplex, or Apartment use or zoning district 
(2)  An identifiable portion of a Planned Development or Planned Development-2, which portion is restricted to residential uses not exceeding 36 feet in height 
Section 4. - Angle and extent of projection.

ARTICLE XXIV. - INTERPRETATION, PURPOSE AND CONFLICT 
    The provisions of this ordinance shall be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety, health, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. If a restrictive covenant or neighborhood deed restriction also applies to property and is more restrictive on the use of the property, it will prevail over this ordinance. If the provisions of this ordinance are more restrictive on the use of the property, this ordinance will prevail. A property owner must observe both sets of requirements and use the land to conform to both. 
    Both the city and an affected person may seek to enforce the city zoning ordinance. The city shall not seek to enforce a restrictive covenant or neighborhood deed restriction to which it is not a party. Any person entitled to benefit from a restrictive covenant or neighborhood deed restriction may seek to enforce it by civil action. 
(Ord. No. 1671, 8-30-00) 
ARTICLE XXIV-A. - CLASSIFICATION OF NEW AND UNLISTED USES 
    It is recognized that new types of land use will develop and forms of land use not anticipated may seek to locate in the City of Duncanville. In order to provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of a land use shall be made as follows: 
(1)  The building official shall refer the question concerning any new or unlisted use to the city planning and zoning commission requesting an interpretation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. The referral of the use interpretation question shall be accompanied by a statement of the facts listing the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity, sales, processing, type of product, storage, and amount or nature thereof, enclosed or open storage, anticipated employment, and the amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material and vibration likely to be generated. 
(2)  The planning and zoning commission shall consider the nature and described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses permitted in the various districts and determine the zoning district within which such use should be permitted. 
(3)  The planning and zoning commission shall transmit its findings and recommendations to the city council as to the zoning district proposed for any new or unlisted use. The city council shall by resolution approve the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission or make a determination concerning the appropriate district for such use. 
(4)  The city council may, at any time, instruct the planning and zoning commission to conduct public hearings to receive comments and to make a recommendation as to the appropriate zoning district for a proposed use. Upon final recommendation by the planning and zoning commission, the city council, after proper notice and public hearing, may amend the zoning ordinance by determining the appropriate zoning district for a new or unlisted use. 
(Ord. No. 1671, 8-30-00)

(A)  The district boundaries are street, alley and property lines unless otherwise shown, and where the districts designated on the map accompanying and made a part of this ordinance are bounded approximately by street, alley, or property lines, the property lines and the center line of the street, or alley shall be construed to be the boundary of the district. 
(B)  Where the district boundaries are otherwise indicated, and where the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks or lots, the district boundaries shall be construed to be property lines, and where the districts designated on the map accompanying and made a part of the ordinance are bounded approximately by lot lines, the lot lines shall be construed to be the boundary of the districts unless the boundaries are otherwise indicted on the map. 
(C)  In unsubdivided property the district boundary lines on the map accompanying and made a part of this ordinance shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map. 
(D)  In case of a district boundary line dividing a platted lot into two parts, the district boundary line shall be construed to be the property line nearest the less restricted district. 
(E)  Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action of the city council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall automatically be extended to the center of such vacancy and all area included in the vacancy shall then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended districts. 
(Ord. No. 1595, § 1, 10-19-99) 
ARTICLE XXVI. - COMPLETION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS 
    Nothing herein contained shall require any changes in the plans, construction or designated use of a building actually under construction at the time of the passage of this ordinance and which entire building shall be complete within one year from the passage of this ordinance. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plans, construction or designated use of a building for which a building permit has been heretofore issued and which entire building shall be complete within six months from the date of the passage of this' ordinance. If any amendment to this ordinance is hereafter adopted changing the boundaries of districts, the provisions of this ordinance with regard to buildings, or premises existing or buildings under construction or building permits issued at the time of the passage of this ordinance, shall apply to building permits issued in the area affected by such amendments at the time of the passage of such amendment. 
ARTICLE XXVII. - PRESERVING RIGHTS IN PENDING LITIGATION AND VIOLATIONS UNDER EXISTING ORDINANCES 
    By the passage of this ordinance, no presently illegal use shall be deemed to have been legalized unless specifically such use falls within a use district where the actual use is a conforming use. Otherwise, such uses shall remain nonconforming uses where recognized or an illegal use, as the case may be. It is further the intent and declared purpose of this ordinance that no offense was committed, and no liability, penalty or forfeiture, either civil or criminal, incurred prior to the time the zoning ordinance was repealed and the present zoning ordinance adopted, shall be discharged or affected by such repeal; but prosecutions and suits for such offenses, liabilities, penalties or forfeitures may be instituted or causes presently pending proceeded within all respects as if such prior ordinance had not been repealed. 
ARTICLE XXVIII. - REPEALING CLAUSE 
    All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed. 
ARTICLE XXIX. - VALIDITY 
    If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, phrase or provision of this ordinance shall be adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional, the same, shall not affect the validity of this ordinance as a whole or any part or provision thereof, other than the part so decided to be invalid or unconstitutional. 
ARTICLE XXX. - WHEN EFFECTIVE 
    The fact that the present zoning regulations are inadequate to properly safeguard the general public welfare, health, peace and safety, creates an urgency and an emergency, and requires that this ordinance become effective immediately upon its passage and publication of the caption of the ordinance as the law provides, and it is accordingly so ordained.

ARTICLE III. - PROCEDURE 
(A)  Preapplication. The subdivider shall avail himself of the advice and assistance of the city officials and consult early and informally with the Chief Administrative Officer before preparing the preliminary plat and before formal application for its approval, in order to save time and money and to make the most of his opportunities. 
(B)  Procedure for conditional approval of preliminary plat. 
(1)  On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended above, regarding his general program and objectives, the subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat, together with improvement plans and other supplementary material as applicable in other sections of these regulations. 
(2)  Five copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary materials specified shall be submitted to the director of public works of the City of Duncanville with the filing fee as provided herein and written application for conditional approval at least 21 days prior to the commission meeting at which it is to be considered. Copies or prints of the proposed subdivision drawn on sheets a maximum size of 24 inches by 36 inches and drawn to a scale of 100 feet to the inch (one inch equals 100 feet), or other appropriate scale as may be directed by the Chief Administrative Officer, shall be submitted in the number specified hereinabove. In cases of large developments which would exceed the dimensions of the sheet of 100 foot scale, preliminary plats may be 200 feet to the inch (one inch equals 200 feet). The five copies or prints of the proposed subdivision shall show the details required by article VI hereof. 
(3)  The following notice shall be placed on the face of each preliminary plat by the developer: "Preliminary Plat." 
(4)  The Chief Administrative Officer, or other person designated by the city council, shall make a study of the plat and give a written report to the commission before its final action on the preliminary plat. 
(5)  Following (a) review of the preliminary plat and other material submitted for conformity thereof to these regulations, and (b) negotiations with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements to be made by him, the commission shall, within 30 days after the filing of such preliminary plat, act thereon as submitted, or modified, and if approved, the commission shall express its approval as conditional approval and state the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express its disapproval and its reasons therefor. 
(6)  The action of the commission shall be noted on two copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions required by the commission. Action of the commission shall be certified by the Chief Administrative Officer. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained in the files of the City of Duncanville. 
(7)  Conditional approval of a preliminary plat by the commission shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layouts submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the installation of streets, water, sewer and other required improvements and utilities and to the preparation of the final or record plat. Except as provided for herein, approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute conditional approval of the final plat when all conditions of approval noted as provided in paragraph (5) of this section have been met. No work shall be done on the subdivision before the final plat is accepted and recorded unless with the written approval of the city planning commission. 
(8)  Conditional approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for two and one-half years unless reviewed by the commission in the light of new or significant information which would necessitate the revision of the preliminary plat. If no development or change in requirements has occurred which would affect the proposed plat at the end of two and one-half years of an effective approval, the commission may extend its approval another year without the submission of a new preliminary plat by reapproving the original preliminary plat. No filing fee is required for such reapproval. 
(C)  Procedure for approval of final plat. 
(1)  The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved and the requirements of chapter 212 of the Local Government Code, and shall incorporate all changes, directions and additions imposed by the commission. 
(2)  If so desired by the developer, the final plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and then develop, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all the requirements of these regulations. 
(3)  Upon receipt of the final plat, accompanied by a final filing fee as prescribed herein, the director of public works shall check the plat to ascertain its compliance with these regulations and the action of the commission. When the copy of the final plat has been checked and found to meet all general requirements and design standards, the developer or its engineers shall submit six copies and one sepia of the final plat to the director of public works. The director of public works shall stamp on each of the seven copies the certificate of approval of the planning commission attested by the chairman or secretary of the planning commission when such final plat has been approved. Three copies and the sepia of the recorded final plat stamped by the county shall be returned immediately upon recording to the director of public works. 
(D)  Procedure for approval of replats. A replat of property not limited by zoning or deed restriction or residential use for not more than two units per lot during the preceding five years shall be approved if it meets all the requirements of this ordinance for a final plat, is signed by only the owners of the property being replatted, is approved by the commission after public hearing, and does not attempt to remove any covenants or restrictions. A replat of property that is so limited by be likewise approved, provided notice of the public hearing is given to owners in the preceding plat in accordance with the requirements of § 212.015 of the Local Government Code, as amended.
