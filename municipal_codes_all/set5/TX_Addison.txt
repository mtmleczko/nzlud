PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Addison, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through August 26, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Bill Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Carmen Moran, City Secretary, and Mr. Kenneth C. Dipple, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the Town of Addison, Texas: 
    Section 1. The Code entitled "Code of Ordinances, Town of Addison, Texas," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of chapters 1 through 86, and appendixes A and B, each inclusive, is adopted. 
    Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before May 11, 1999, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00 except that a fine not to exceed $2,000.00 shall be imposed upon a person convicted for violation of this Code if the violation governs fire safety, zoning or public health or sanitation, including the dumping of refuse. The penalty for a violation of this code shall not exceed or be less than the penalty prescribed by state law for the same or similar offense. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the Town may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the Town to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Charter of the Town of Addison, Texas, as adopted by the voters on August 12, 1978. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. As Charter amendments altered the name of the municipality from city of Addison to Town of Addison, and at the instructions of the town, "City of Addison" has been changed to "Town of Addison" and "town hall" is substituted for "city hall."

(b)  When used in this section, the term "represent" shall include all communications with and appearances before the town in which the town is asked to make a decision, as that term is defined in this chapter. The term "represent" does not include communications and appearances involving only ministerial action on the part of the town. 
(c)  When used in this section, the term "case, project or matter" shall refer to specific cases, projects or regulatory matters, rather than generic policies, procedures or legislation of general application. For instance, the zoning process or site plan review process is not a "case, project or matter" within the meaning of this section; however, a specific zoning case or site plan would constitute a "case, project or matter" subject to the restrictions imposed in this section. It is not the intent of this division, and this division shall not be construed, to proscribe the practice of any profession or occupation by former town officials and employees other than before the town and as provided in section 2-96. 
(d)  An employee in a position which involves significant decision-making, advisory, or supervisory responsibility, or an officer who leaves the service or employment of the town shall not, within 12 months after leaving that employment or service, represent any other person or entity in any formal or informal appearance, if the officer or employee has received or shall receive remuneration from the person, entity or members of the entity being represented: 
(1)  Before the town concerning a case, project or matter over which the person exercised discretionary authority as an employee or officer; or 
(2)  Before any other agency on a case, project or matter over which the person exercised discretionary authority as an employee or officer. 
(e)  A former employee or officer who is subject to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section shall, during the 24 months after leaving the service or employment of the town, disclose his previous position and responsibilities with the town and the work performed, if any, as an employee or officer regarding the matter for which he is appearing before the town whenever he represents any other person or entity in any formal or informal appearance before the town. 
(f)  In any formal or informal appearance before the town, a person representing a person or entity which employs a former officer or employee who had discretionary authority over the project or matter for which the person or entity is appearing before the town shall disclose any former involvement of such former officer or employee in the project or matter. This disclosure requirement shall be in effect for 24 months after the former officer or employee leaves town service or employment. 
(g)  No employee or officer shall approve or vote to approve any oral or written contract for land services, supplies or materials between the town and either a former employee or officer or an entity which employs such former employee or officer during the 12-month period following such former employee's or officer's departure from the town's employment or service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a finding by the city council that the economic or other benefit to the former employee or officer is minimal or insignificant, the city council may vote to waive the prohibition contained in this subsection. 
(Code 1982, § 2-6) 
Sec. 2-96. - Accepting employment from an entity regulated by town prohibited. 
    An employee in a position which involves significant reporting, decision-making, advisory, regulatory or supervisory responsibility who leaves the service or employment of the town shall not, within six months after leaving that service or employment, seek or accept employment from an entity which had appeared for formal action or decision before the body of which such employee was a member or which had been subject to the employee's regulation or inspection during such employee's employment with the town.

DIVISION 2. - FINANCIAL POLICIES 

Sec. 2-171. - Purpose. 
    The Town of Addison, Texas financial policies set forth the basic framework for the fiscal management of the Town. These policies were developed within the parameters established by applicable provisions of the Texas Local Government Code and the Town of Addison City Charter. The policies are intended to assist the City Council and city staff in evaluating current activities and proposals for future programs. The policies are to be reviewed on an annual basis and modified to accommodate changing circumstances or conditions. Minor changes in policies have been adopted as a result of the issuance of GASB Statement 34 and are noted in italics. While the modified policies influenced how certain funds are displayed or organized, the changes did not affect the application of financial resources to government programs. 
(Code 1982, § 2-251; Ord. No. 001-008, § 1(Exh. A), 3-13-01; Ord. No. 010-037, § 2.A., 11-9-10) 
Sec. 2-172. - Annual budget. (Charter Requirements*) 
(a)  The fiscal year of the Town of Addison shall begin on October 1 of each calendar year and will end on September 30 of the following calendar year. The fiscal year will also be established as the accounting and budget year.* 
(b)  The City Manager, prior to August first of each year, shall prepare and submit to the City Secretary the annual budget covering the next fiscal year, which shall contain the following information:* 
(1)  The City Manager's budget message shall outline the proposed financial policies for the next fiscal year with explanations of any changes from previous years in expenditures and any major changes of policy and a complete statement regarding the financial condition of the Town. 
(2)  An estimate of all revenue from taxes and other sources, including the present tax structure rates and property valuations for the ensuing year. 
(3)  A carefully itemized list of proposed expenses by office, department, agency, and project for the budget year, as compared to actual expenses of the last ended fiscal year, and estimated expenses for the current year compared to adopted budget. 
(4)  A description of all outstanding bonded indebtedness of the Town. 
(5)  A statement proposing any capital expenditure deemed necessary for undertaking during the next budget year and recommended provision for financing. 
(6)  A list of capital projects which should be undertaken within the next five succeeding years. 
(7)  A five-year financial plan for the General, Hotel, Airport, and Utility Funds. 
(c)  The City Manager's budget should assume, for each fund, operating revenues that are equal to or exceed operating expenditures. The City Manager's budget message shall explain the reasons for any fund that reflects operating expenditures exceeding operating revenues.* 
(d)  At least one public hearing shall be conducted before the City Council, allowing interested citizens to express their opinions concerning items of expenditure, giving their reasons for wishing to increase or decrease any items of expense. The notice of hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the Town not less than 15 days or more than 30 days following date of notice.* 
(e)  Following the public hearing, the City Council shall analyze the budget, making any additions or deletions which they feel appropriate, and shall, at least three days prior to the beginning of the next fiscal year, adopt the budget by a favorable majority vote. If the City Council fails to adopt the budget, the Town shall continue to operate under the existing budget until such time as the City Council adopts a budget for the ensuing fiscal year.* 
(f)  On final adoption, the budget shall be in effect for the budget year. Final adoption of the budget by the City Council shall constitute the official appropriations for the current year and shall constitute the basis of the official levy of the property tax. Under conditions which may arise, the City Council may amend or change the budget to provide for any additional expense.* 
(g)  The annual budget document shall be published in a format that satisfies all criteria established by the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Program. The final budget document shall be published no later than 90 days following the date of the budget's adoption by the City Council.

Sec. 2-173. - Basis of accounting and budgeting. 
(a)  The Town's finances shall be accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). 
(1)  The accounts of the Town are organized and operated on the basis of funds and account groups. Fund accounting segregates funds according to their intended purpose and is used to aid management in demonstrating compliance with finance-related legal and contractual provisions. The minimum number of funds is maintained consistent with legal and managerial requirements. Account groups are a reporting device to account for certain assets and liabilities of the governmental funds not recorded directly in those funds. Governmental funds are used to account for the government's general government activities and include the General, Special Revenue, Debt Service and Capital Project Funds. 
(2)  Governmental fund types use the flow of current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recognized when susceptible to accrual (i.e., when they are "measurable and available"). "Measurable" means the amount of the transaction can be determined, and "available" means collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. Substantially all revenues are considered to be susceptible to accrual. Ad valorem, sales, hotel, franchise and tax revenues recorded in the General Fund and ad valorem tax revenues recorded in the Debt Service Fund are recognized under the susceptible to accrual concept. Licenses and permits, charges for services, fines and forfeitures, and miscellaneous revenues (except earnings on investments) are recorded as revenues when received in cash because they are generally not measurable until actually received. Investment earnings are recorded as earned since they are measurable and available. Expenditures are recognized when the related fund liability is incurred, if measurable, except for principal and interest on general long-term debt, which are recorded when due, and compensated absences, which are recorded when payable from currently available financial resources. 
(3)  The Town utilizes encumbrance accounting for its governmental fund types, under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the expenditure of monies are recorded in order to reserve that portion of the applicable appropriation. 
(4)  The Town's proprietary fund types are accounted for on a flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of accounting. Under this method, revenues are recorded when earned, and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. 
(b)  The Town's annual budgets shall be prepared and adopted on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles for all governmental and proprietary funds except the capital projects funds, which adopt project-length budgets. Also, depreciation of fixed assets is not recognized in proprietary fund budgets. All annual appropriations lapse at fiscal year end. Under the Town's budgetary process, outstanding encumbrances are reported as reservations of fund balances and do not constitute expenditures or liabilities since the commitments will be reappropriated and honored the subsequent fiscal year. 
(c)  The issuance of Statement 34 by GASB has influenced the creation and reporting of individual funds. GASB 34 essentially mandates dual accounting systems: one for government-wide (i.e. the government as a single entity) reporting and another for individual fund reporting. Under GASB 34 for individual funds, the Town will continue utilizing the accounting and budgeting processes as described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section. However, because GASB 34 mandates the flow of economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting for the government-wide reporting, extensive reconciliation must be performed to present aggregated fund information in the government-wide reporting model. Therefore, individual operating funds will be created with the objective of reducing fund to government-wide reconciliation as much as possible. When appropriate, individual funds will be examined as to whether it will be appropriate to account for them as proprietary fund types. Also, the Town will limit the use of internal service funds and incorporate the financial transactions of those funds into other governmental funds. 
(Code 1982, § 2-253; Ord. No. 001-008, § 1(Exh. A), 3-13-01; Ord. No. 010-037, § 2.A., 11-9-10) 
Sec. 2-174. - Budget administration. 
(a)  All expenses of the Town shall be made in accordance with the adopted annual budget. The department level is the legal level of control enacted by the Town Charter. Budgetary control is maintained at the individual expenditure account level by the review of all requisitions of estimated purchase amounts prior to the release of purchase orders to vendors. 
(b)  The following represents the Town's budget amendment policy delineating responsibility and authority for the amendment process. Transfers between expenditure accounts in one department may occur with the approval of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Transfers between operating departments may occur with the approval of the City Manager and CFO provided that a department's total budget is not changed by more than five percent. Transfers between funds or transfers between departments that change a department's total budget by more than five percent must be accomplished by budget amendment approved by the City Council. Budget amendments calling for new fund appropriations must also be approved by the City Council. 
(Code 1982, § 2-254; Ord. No. 001-008, § 1(Exh. A), 3-13-01; Ord. No. 005-060, § 2(2), 11-8-05; Ord. No. 010-037, § 2.A., 11-9-10) 
Sec. 2-175. - Financial reporting. 
(a)  Following the conclusion of the fiscal year, the Town's CFO shall cause to be prepared a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) in accordance with generally accepted accounting and financial reporting principles established by GASB. The document shall also satisfy all criteria of the Government Finance Officers Association's Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting Program. 
(b)  The CAFR shall show the status of the Town's finances on the basis of GAAP. The CAFR shall show fund revenues and expenditures on both a GAAP basis and budget basis for comparison purposes. In all but two cases this reporting conforms to the way the Town prepares its budget. Compensated absences (accrued but unused sick leave) are not reflected in the budget but are accounted for in the CAFR's long-term debt account group. Depreciation expense is not shown in the budget's proprietary funds, although the full purchase price of equipment and capital improvements is reflected as uses of working capital. 
(c)  Included as part of the CAFR shall be the results of the annual audit prepared by independent certified public accountants designated by the City Council. 
(d)  The CFO shall, within 60 days following the conclusion of each calendar quarter, issue a report to the City Council reflecting the Town's financial condition for that quarter. The quarterly report format shall be consistent with the format of the annual budget document. 
(Code 1982, § 2-255; Ord. No. 001-008, § 1(Exh. A), 3-13-01; Ord. No. 005-060, § 2(3), 11-8-05; Ord. No. 010-037, § 2.A., 11-9-10) 
Sec. 2-176. - Revenues. 
(a)  To protect the Town's financial integrity, the Town will maintain a diversified and stable revenue system to shelter it from fluctuations in any one revenue source. Recognizing that sales tax is a volatile, unpredictable source of revenue, the Town will attempt to reduce its dependence on sales tax revenue. 
(b)  For every annual budget, the Town shall levy four property tax rates: debt service, operation/maintenance, infrastructure investment and economic development. 
(1)  Debt service. The debt service levy shall be sufficient for meeting all principal and interest payments associated with the Town's outstanding general obligation debt for that budget year. The debt service levy and related debt service expenditures shall be accounted for in the Debt Service Fund. 
(2)  Operation and maintenance. The operation and maintenance levy shall be accounted for in the General Fund. The operation and maintenance levy will be established within the eight percent rollback rate as defined by the State of Texas Property Tax Code. City Council will consider exceeding the rollback rate only after options have been presented by staff to avoid the rollback by increasing revenue from other sources or reducing expenditures. 
(3)  Infrastructure investment. Each year, $0.006201 of the operation and maintenance levy shall be designated to fund the Infrastructure Investment Fund. Funds held in the Infrastructure Investment Fund may be appropriated to support pay-as-you-go capital projects or significant non-routine capital expenditures of not less than $500,000.00. The City Council may consider using these funds for projects or expenditures of a lesser amount on a case-by-case basis. 
(4)  Economic development. The economic development levy shall be $0.023716. The economic development levy and expenditures shall be accounted for in the Economic Development Fund. 
(c)  The Town will maintain a policy of levying the lowest tax rate on the broadest tax base. Minimal exemptions will be provided to homeowners, senior citizens, and disabled veterans. The Town may consider providing tax abatements or other incentives to encourage development. 
(d)  The Town will establish user charges and fees at a level that attempts to recover the full cost of providing the service. 
(1)  User fees, particularly utility rates, should identify the relative costs of serving different classes of customers. 
(2)  Where possible, utility rates should be designed to reduce peak (hour and day) demands on the utility systems. 
(3)  The Town will make every reasonable attempt to ensure accurate measurement of variables impacting taxes and fees (e.g. verification of business sales tax payments, verification of appraisal district property values, and accuracy of water meters). 
(e)  The Town will attempt to maximize the application of its financial resources by obtaining supplementary funding through agreements with other public and private agencies for the provision of public services or the construction of capital improvements. 
(f)  The Town will consider market rates and charges levied by other public and private organizations for similar services in establishing tax rates, fees and charges. 
(g)  When developing the annual budget, the City Manager shall project revenues from every source based on actual collections from the preceding year and estimated collections of the current fiscal year, while taking into account known circumstances which will impact revenues for the new fiscal year. The revenue projections for each fund should be made conservatively so that total actual fund revenues exceed budgeted projections. 
(Code 1982, § 2-256; Ord. No. 001-008, § 1(Exh. A), 3-13-01; Ord. No. 005-060, § 2(4), 11-8-05; Ord. No. 010-037, § 2.A., 11-9-10; Ord. No. 017-04, § 1, 2-14-17 ) 
Sec. 2-177. - Operating expenditures. 
(a)  Operating expenditures shall be accounted, reported, and budgeted for in the following major categories: 
(1)  Operating, recurring expenditures: 
a.  Personal services. 
b.  Supplies. 
c.  Maintenance. 
d.  Contractual services. 
e.  Capital replacement/lease. 
(2)  Operating, nonrecurring expenditures: 
a.  Capital equipment. 
(b)  The annual budget shall appropriate sufficient funds for operating, recurring expenditures necessary to maintain established (i.e., status quo) quality and scope of city services. 
(c)  The Town will constantly examine the methods for providing public services in order to reduce operating, recurring expenditures and/or enhance quality and scope of public services with no increase to cost. 
(d)  Personal service expenditures will reflect the minimum staffing needed to provide established quality and scope of city services. To attract and retain employees necessary for providing high-quality service, the Town shall maintain a compensation and benefit package competitive with the public and, when quantifiable, private service industries. 
(e)  Supply expenditures shall be sufficient for ensuring the optimal productivity of Town employees. 
(f)  Maintenance expenditures shall be sufficient for addressing the deterioration of the Town's capital assets to ensure the optimal productivity of the capital assets. Maintenance should be conducted to ensure a relatively stable level of maintenance expenditures for every budget year. 
(g)  The Town will utilize contracted labor for the provision of city services whenever private contractors can perform the established level of service at less expense to the Town. The Town will regularly evaluate its agreements with private contractors to ensure the established levels of service are performed at the least expense to the Town. 
(h)  For capital expenditures needed as a part of continued operations: 
(1)  Capital equipment is defined as equipment that exceeds $5,000.00 and has a useful life of at least three years. Existing capital equipment shall be replaced when needed to ensure the optimal productivity of Town employees. Existing capital equipment associated with General Fund operations will be depreciated by charges to the departments using the equipment. The depreciation charges will be sufficient for replacing the capital equipment at the end of its expected useful life. The depreciation charges and application of those funds will be accounted for in the Capital Replacement Fund.

(i)  Expenditures for additional capital equipment shall be made only to enhance employee productivity, improve quality of service, or expand scope of service. 
(j)  To assist in controlling the growth of operating expenditures, operating departments will submit their annual budgets to the City Manager within a ceiling calculated by the CFO.

(a)  The Town will issue debt only to fund capital projects and capital purchases such as vehicles and equipment that cannot be supported by current, annual revenues. 
(b)  To minimize interest payments on issued debt, the Town will seek to maintain a rapid debt retirement policy by issuing debt with maximum maturities not exceeding 15 years, except in instances when the capital improvements and capital purchases will significantly benefit the community beyond the 15-year period.

Sec. 2-181. - Capital project expenditures. 
(a)  The Town will develop a multi-year plan for capital projects, which identifies all projects likely to be constructed within a five-year horizon. The multi-year plan will reflect for each project the likely source of funding and attempt to quantify the project's impact to future operating expenditures. 
(b)  Capital projects will be constructed to: 
(1)  Protect or improve the community's quality of life. 
(2)  Protect or enhance the community's economic vitality. 
(3)  Support and service new development. 
(c)  To minimize the issuance of debt, the Town will attempt to support capital projects with appropriations from operating revenues or excess fund balances (i.e., "pay-as-you-go").

(a)  The City Manager appoints the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Financial Officer's designee(s) as the "investment officers" of the Town. Direct management responsibility for the investment program is delegated by the City Council to the Chief Financial Officer (hereinafter referred to as the "CFO"). The investment officers' authority will at all times be limited by all applicable laws and regulations in effect from time to time and this policy. The investment officers shall exercise the judgment and care, under prevailing circumstances, that a prudent person would exercise in the management of the person's own affairs. Unless authorized by law, a person may not deposit, withdraw, transfer, or manage in any other manner the funds of the investing entity. 
(b)  With written approval from the City Manager, the CFO may delegate any phase of the investment management program to any of the Investment Officers. Such approval shall state specifically the functions such person is authorized to perform or that the person is authorized to perform all activities of the CFO under this Policy. The CFO shall obtain and maintain, at the Town's expense, fidelity bonds for himself and each of his designees in amounts determined adequate by the CFO (which shall not be less than $250,000.00) for each fiscal year as shown by the approved budget. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the CFO. A current list of persons authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of the Town shall be maintained by the CFO. 
(c)  The CFO shall develop and maintain written administrative procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this policy. The controls shall be designed to prevent, identify and control losses of public funds arising from deviation from this policy, fraud, employee error, misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees and officers of the Town. 
(d)  In the discretion of the City Council and in any event upon the termination or reassignment of any investment officer authorized to conduct transactions for the Town pursuant to this Division, the authority of such person shall be revoked and such revocation of authority shall be immediately communicated by the CFO orally and in writing to each and every depository, broker/dealer, investment advisor, custodian and other agency or entity with whom the Town has any existing or continuing relationship in the management of its investments. 
(e)  The CFO and all Investment Officers shall attend at least one training session relating to the treasurer's or officer's responsibilities within 12 months after taking office or assuming duties; and attend a training session not less than once in a two-year period that begins on the first day of the Town's fiscal year and consists of the two consecutive fiscal years after that date, and receive not less than eight hours of training. Such training from an independent source shall be approved or endorsed by the Government Finance Officers Association, Government Finance Officers Association of Texas, Government Treasurers Organization of Texas, Texas Municipal League, or the North Central Texas Council of Governments to include education in investment controls, security risks, strategy risks, market risks, and compliance with the Public Funds Investment Act.

To be eligible for consideration, an investment advisor shall demonstrate to the CFO knowledge of, and experience in, the management of public funds. The CFO will satisfy himself as to the advisor's qualifications by all appropriate means, including reference checks with the advisor's other clients, the State Securities Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. An appointed investment advisor shall act solely in an advisory and administrative capacity, within the guidelines of this Division, and without any discretionary authority to transact business on behalf of the Town. 
(b)  Each investment advisor appointed by the Town shall agree that its investment advice shall at all times be given with the judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons paid for their special prudence, discretion and intelligence, in such matters exercise in the management of their client's affairs, not for speculation by the client or production of fee income by the advisor or broker, but for investment by the client with emphasis on the probable safety of the capital while considering the probable income to be derived. 
(c)  Appointment of an investment advisor shall otherwise be according to the Town's normal purchasing procedures for selecting professional services. Any approved investment advisor may be terminated with the approval of the City Manager if in the opinion of the CFO the advisor has not performed adequately. The term of any investment advisor contract may not exceed five years. Any renewal or extension of an investment advisor contract must be made by the City Council by resolution.

(b)  The overall investment program shall be designed and managed with a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the public trust. The CFO and the investment officers shall recognize that the investment activities of the Town are a matter of public record. 
(c)  The CFO and the investment officers, acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising the proper standard of care, shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided that this Division and the CFO's procedures were followed. In determining whether the CFO or an investment officer has exercised the proper standard of care, all investments over which the individual had responsibility will be considered rather than a single investment.

Sec. 2-208. - Other investment guidelines. 
(a)  The Town seeks active management of its portfolio assets. In the effort of meeting the objectives of this policy, the Town may, from time to time, sell securities that it owns in order to better position its portfolio assets. Sales of securities prior to maturity shall be documented and approved by the CFO before such a transaction is consummated. Sales of securities yielding net proceeds less than 98 percent of the book value of the securities must be approved in advance and in writing by both the City Manager and the CFO. 
(b)  Each investment transaction must be based upon competitive quotations received from at least three broker/dealers who have been approved by the Town in accordance with State law. 
(c)  The purchase and sale of all securities shall be on a delivery-versus-payment or payment-versus-delivery basis (i.e., for securities purchases, monies will not be released by the Town's safekeeping bank until securities are received at the Federal Reserve Bank for further credit to the Town's safekeeping bank. In the case of securities sales, monies will be received by the Town's safekeeping bank via the Federal Reserve Bank as the securities are simultaneously released to the purchaser). In this manner, the Town will always have possession of either its securities or its monies. 
(d)  An investment that requires a minimum credit rating does not qualify as an authorized securities investment during the period the investment does not have the minimum credit rating even if the investment had the appropriate rating at the time of purchase.

The weighted average maturity of all securities and certificates of deposit in the Town's total investment portfolio at any given time (excluding cash and demand deposits) shall not exceed one and one-half years. 
(c)  In the case of callable securities, the first "call" date may be used as the "maturity" date for investment purposes in this Section if, in the opinion of the CFO, there is little doubt that the security will be called prior to maturity.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division 3 shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this division, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Access permit means a permit issued by the Town of Addison to an off-airport user permitting the off-airport user the unique privilege of using the airport public area directly from the off-airport property for either a recreational/incidental business use or commercial aviation use. 
    Access taxiway means an aircraft taxiway located on off-airport property that connects or feeds into a taxiway on the airport and that is constructed for or intended to be used for the principal purpose of allowing aircraft to taxi between the airport and one or more off-airport properties and is approved as an access taxiway by the city as evidenced by plat approval, easement dedication or as reflected in the airport layout plan. 
    Airport public area expenses means an amount of money equal to all known expenses and costs incurred or expended by the city to operate the airport public area for the benefit, use and privilege of the general aviation public during the most recently completed fiscal year as accounted for by the city, and being an amount equal to total airport expenses adjusted by (i) a reduction for any expenses and costs directly attributed to the operation and maintenance of non-public airport facilities, (ii) a reduction using a commercially reasonable allocation of Airport related expenses and costs that cannot be specifically attributed to either the expense and cost of operating the airport public area or non-public airport facilities of the airport (e.g., without limitation, the pro-rated costs of city staff overhead related to airport operation and maintenance, airport management fee, and certain maintenance tools and material used while maintaining the airport without distinction to its public and non-public use), (iii) a reduction as a result of public revenue actually collected, and (iv) an allowance for the city's five-year airport capital improvements plan reserve. 
    Airport public area maintenance rate means a dollar amount calculated on a per square foot basis of the airport public area expenses by dividing the airport public area expenses by the total land area (in gross square feet) of all non-public airport facilities and total off-airport properties. 
    Affiliate means a person or entity owning a majority interest in an off-airport property or a family member of an owner of an off-airport property. 
    Aircraft owner means anyone who owns or leases a specific aircraft and holds the exclusive right to fly or sell the aircraft (including but not limited to an individual, corporation, chief pilot, leasing company, or aircraft manager). 
    Airport means the area known as the Addison Airport which is now or hereafter designated and set aside for the landing and taking off of aircraft, and accessory or appurtenant uses, facilities and improvements thereto, and used or to be used in the interest of the public for such purposes. 
    Airport director means the director or manager of the airport (whether designated pursuant to a contract between the city and a third party or otherwise). 
    Air navigation facility means: (a) a facility, other than one owned and operated by the United States, used in or available or designed for use in aid of air navigation, including a structure, mechanism, light, beacon, marker, communications system, or other instrumentality; (b) a device used or useful as an aid in the safe landing, navigation, or takeoff of aircraft or the safe and efficient operation or maintenance of an airport; or (c) a combination of those facilities or devices. 
    Airport public area means that portion of the airport, which is now or hereafter considered by the FAA, TxDOT, the city, or any other regulatory agency with oversight of the airport to be the obligation and responsibility of the city to operate and maintain for the common use and benefit of the general aviation public. The airport public area includes, without limitation, any air navigation facility or structure designed and intended to serve the general public not specifically subject to a lease agreement; all runways, taxiways and other common-use paved, graveled or turfed areas and their respective protection zones, safety areas and/or object free areas; any other facility or facilities at the Airport that are eligible for federal or state grants or subsidies awarded on the basis of their serving the benefit of the public (including runways, taxiways, vehicle streets and alleys, public aircraft aprons/tarmac, vehicle parking areas, and drainage structures); field lighting and associated beacon and lighted wind and landing direction indicators; security, fire, and emergency medical protection; protection of aerial approaches to the airport; directional signs; and perimeter or restricted access fences. Generally, the airport public area is the total area and facilities of the airport exclusive of all non-public airport facilities, and may vary from time to time depending on the total land comprising the airport and the change of land use at the airport. (The airport less non-public airport facilities equals the airport public area). 
    Access fee means the fee to be paid annually to the city for access to the airport from an off-airport property as described in this division. 
    City means the Town of Addison, Texas, a home-rule municipality. 
    City manager means the city manager of the city or the city manager's designee.

    FAA means the Federal Aviation Administration or its successor entity. 
    Non-public airport facilities means generally any land, building, or other facility or improvement on the airport that is subject to or otherwise intended to be subject to an arrangement that prohibits or restricts access or use by the general aviation public.

    Off-airport access means access to the airport for aviation purposes from off-airport property in accordance with this division, an access permit, and applicable law, rule, or regulation. Off-airport access is frequently referred to as a "through-the-fence" operation, even though an airport's perimeter fence may be imaginary.

    Off-airport user means an owner of the fee simple title of an off-airport property who is issued and holds an access permit to conduct off-airport access operations as either a recreational/incidental business user or as a commercial aeronautical user directly between the off-airport property and the airport in accordance with the access permit issued by the city. 
    Public revenue means a sum of revenue collected (or a commercially reasonable allocation thereof) by the city available for the offset of the cost to operate and provide airport services and benefits used by the general aviation public. Examples of public revenue include, but are not necessarily limited to, an allocated portion of fuel flowage revenue, fund account interest income, U.S. Department of Agriculture trash disposal revenue, and revenue received from the processing and clearing of U.S. Customs Operations. 
    Recreational/incidental business use means the use of an off-airport property for aviation operations which is either recreational in nature or is incidental to a non-aviation business conducted on the off-airport property (i.e., a business that uses an aircraft as an incidental use in support of the business, such as, for example, an architect, technology company, or an oil company using an aircraft to transport people, not product). 
    Total airport expenses means an amount of money equal to the all known expenses and costs incurred and expended by the city to operate the airport during the most recently completed fiscal year. 
    Total off-airport properties means the aggregate of all properties, each of which is or may become an off-airport property, as determined by the city. 
    TxDOT means the Texas Department of Transportation or its successor entity. 
Sec. 14-101. - Findings. 
    In enacting this division, the Town finds that: 
(1)  Off-airport access is a unique class of aviation operation at Addison Airport, which is neither itinerant in nature nor based from any aviation facility located within the airport. Within this class there are two distinct subclasses: 
a.  the recreational/incidental business use; and 
b.  the commercial aviation use. 
(2)  The airport public area constitutes the property and improvements on and within the airport that are maintained by the city for the public's common use and are available to and used by off-airport users. 
(3)  The airport public area expenses constitute the expenses and costs of operation to the city of the airport public area. 
(4)  Where the aviation use of an off-airport property is a commercial aviation use, such use may compete directly with the operation of commercial aviation enterprises located within the airport. Accordingly, it is fair, reasonable, and equitable, for the purpose of setting a fee for access to the airport from an off-airport property, to distinguish between those off-airport users who use their off-airport property primarily for a commercial aviation use, and those who use their off-airport property primarily for a recreational/incidental business use. 
(5)  Off-airport commercial aviation users can be expected to use the airport in proportion to the gross land area or parcel size of their off-airport property. It is fair, reasonable and equitable to use the gross land area or parcel size of an off-airport commercial aviation user to allocate and charge each such user for airport public area expenses as set forth herein. 
(6)  Off-airport recreational/incidental business users can be expected to use the airport significantly less than commercial aviation users. It is fair, reasonable and equitable to allocate and charge all such users for airport public area expenses through a flat fee. 
(7)  Airport public area expenses can be expected to rise with inflation. It is fair, reasonable and equitable to redetermine the airport public area maintenance rate and to adjust access fees for inflation as set forth herein. Other methods for estimating or measuring the changes in airport public area expenses over time would be impracticable and unreasonable under the circumstances. 
(8)  Off-airport users provide indirect benefits to the airport and enhance opportunities for future aeronautical growth and development for the benefit of the airport, the public and on-airport operations. It is fair, reasonable and equitable to adjust the airport public area maintenance rate as set forth herein to recognize these indirect benefits and to promote the further economic development and use of the airport and aeronautical properties adjacent to the airport while ensuring fair and equitable competitive operation as between on-airport and off-airport operations. 
(9)  The fees set forth in this division for access to the airport from an off-airport property are reasonable and uniform for the same class of privilege or service, and are established with due regard to the property and improvements used and the expenses of operation to the city. 
(10)  The terms of this division satisfy and comply with both federal law, rules and regulations and state law, including, without limitation, FAA grants and assurances and, to the extent that it applies, the Texas Transportation Code. 
Sec. 14-102. - Access to airport by off-airport user; lien. 
(a)  Any unauthorized access to the airport property either by foot, vehicle or aircraft is expressly prohibited. Except for authorized access, including authorized access from an off-airport property as set forth in this division, the city manager is charged with the responsibility to safeguard the airport by constructing and maintaining at all times a fence or other form of barrier sufficient to restrict unauthorized pedestrian, vehicle or aircraft access to and from the airport property. If access to the airport from an off-airport property is not authorized by the city for any reason (including, without limitation, for breach by an off-airport user of an access permit) and the city constructs or places a fence or other barrier to prevent access to the airport from an off-airport property, the off-airport user shall, as a condition precedent to obtaining access to the airport, reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city in constructing or placing and in removing the fence or other barrier. 
(b)  Use and access to the airport from an off-airport property may be permitted to an off-airport user subject to the terms and conditions of an access permit issued by the city as provided for in section 14-105 of this division (the "access permit"). The access permit allows an off-airport user the unique privilege of accessing the airport from an off-airport property for either recreational/incidental business use or a commercial aviation use. Such privilege is granted for the term specified in and is subject to all of the terms and conditions of this division, the access permit, and all other applicable laws, ordinances, rules, codes, standards, policies, regulations, grant assurances, and grant agreements, whether currently in effect, hereafter adopted, or as may be amended, modified, changed, or superseded, and subject to the use of the airport for airport purposes and the off-airport user's compliance with and fulfillment of all of the terms, conditions, provisions and regulations of this division, all other applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and the access permit. 
(c)  Any access permit, if issued in the town's sole discretion, is subject to the initial and ongoing approval and consent by the FAA and by TxDOT, and is subject to the terms, conditions and requirements of any existing or future grant agreement(s) or grant assurance(s) at or in connection with the airport (and may be revoked, terminated or canceled immediately if any such access permit(s) is in violation of any such grant agreement(s) or grant assurance(s) or any FAA or TxDOT policy, rule, permit, standard, or regulation, or any local, state or federal law, policy, rule, permit, standard, or regulation, whether currently in effect, hereafter adopted, or as may be amended, modified, changed, or superseded). 
(d)  The city, by and through the city manager, may issue an access permit in the form approved by the city manager, provided that such form shall comply with the terms of this division (but may include additional terms and conditions as approved by the city manager). 
(e)  An off-airport user shall comply at all times with and abide by all environmental laws, rules, regulations, standards, and policies of any governmental authority (whether federal, state or local, and including, without limitation, the Environmental Protection Agency (or its successor entity), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (or its successor entity) and the city), and shall file any and all reports and provide any such information as may be required by any such governmental authority in connection therewith. 
(f)  An off-airport user shall annually submit (on a date set by the airport director) a property security plan in form and content acceptable to the airport director. 
(g)  An off-airport user shall register and periodically affirm the appropriate contact information of the off-airport user as required by the airport director. The off-airport user shall also register or periodically affirm with the airport director all aircraft stored or based at the off-airport property by providing the airport director each aircraft's registration number ("N" number), make, model, and the aircraft owner's name and contact information. 
(h)  Access gates placed by an off-airport user which restrict access from the off-airport property to the airport shall include a sign stating no-trespassing, emergency contact information, the building address for city emergency personnel, and such other information as the city may require. The form and content of such sign shall be subject to the approval of the city. 
(i)  (1)  Lien. The city shall have a continuing lien against each off-airport property to secure payment of any delinquent annual off-airport access fee (or portion thereof), as well as interest thereon, late fees, and costs of collection, including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees. Although no further action is required to create or perfect the lien, the city may, as further evidence and notice of the lien, execute and record a document setting forth as to any off-airport property, the amount of delinquent sums due the city at the time such document is executed and the fact that a lien exists to secure the payment thereof. However, the failure of the city to execute and record any such document shall not, to any extent, affect the validity, enforceability, perfection or priority of the lien. 
(2)  Enforcement of lien. The lien may be enforced by judicial or non-judicial foreclosure. Each owner of an off-airport property, by accepting an access permit, grants to the city, whether or not it is so expressed in the access permit, a private power of non-judicial sale to be exercised in accordance with Chapter 51, Texas Property Code, as amended. The city may appoint, from time to time, any person including an officer, agent, trustee, substitute trustee or attorney, to exercise the city's lien rights on behalf of the city, including the power of sale. 
(3)  Subordination of lien. The lien provided for herein is subordinate to the lien of any recorded mortgage or deed of trust against an off-airport property. 
(4)  Effect of conveyance. An owner that conveys title to an off-airport property shall not be liable for any delinquent annual off-airport access fee that is attributable to the period after the conveyance of the off-airport property. However, a conveyance of title to an off-airport property shall not affect the lien or relieve the owner that conveys the off-airport property from personal liability for any delinquent annual off-airport access fee attributable to the period prior to the date of the conveyance. 
(5)  Effect of foreclosure. The foreclosure of a mortgage, trustee's sale of a deed of trust or a deed in lieu thereof will extinguish the lien described herein as to annual off-airport access fee payments attributable to the period prior to the foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu thereof; such foreclosure shall also cause the immediate termination of the access permit. However, a foreclosure of a mortgage, trustee's sale of a deed of trust or a deed in lieu thereof will not relieve such off-airport property or owner thereof from liability for any annual off-airport access fee payment attributable to the period after the foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu thereof. The foreclosure of a mortgage deed of trust or a deed in lieu thereof shall not release the owner whose off-airport property is being foreclosed, sold at a trustee's sale or conveyed pursuant to a deed in lieu from the owner's obligation to pay annual off-airport access fees attributable to the period prior to the date of such foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu thereof. 
(6)  Cumulative remedies. This subsection is cumulative of any other remedies, methods of collection or security available to the city under this division, the City Charter, or any other ordinances, laws, rules, regulations, standards, or permits of the city, the state, or the United States. This subsection does not affect the city's authority to refuse to furnish access to the airport, to terminate an access permit, or to take any other action, when any delinquent annual off-airport access fees exist. 
Sec. 14-103. - Security. 
(a)  The city manager may at any time require all pedestrian, vehicular and aviation access between the off-airport property and the airport to be controlled at all times using automated controlled-access devices, gate operators, closers with automatic locks or other such reliable devices, or any other means of affirmative control acceptable to the city manager, that serves to continually safeguard the airport from unauthorized access from the off-airport property. The city manager, the airport director, or any other authority responsible for operation and safety of the airport shall have the right to inspect the off-airport property from time to time for conformance with this division and/or the access permit. 
(b)  The city manager, the airport director, or any other authority responsible for operation and safety of the airport is authorized by this division to take appropriate action to ensure the airport is safeguarded at all times, including the temporary override of gates, closers and locks of damaged or otherwise found inoperable gates and/or doors, or the placement of blockades or other types of barriers or fencing material as needed. Such safeguards, when taken, shall be clearly posted and not removed except as authorized by the city manager or airport director. 
(c)  All safety and operational rules and regulations established by the FAA or TxDOT, by any city ordinance, rule, regulation, policy, standard, or permit, or by any other regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the airport (whether currently in effect, hereafter adopted, or as may be amended, modified, changed, or superseded), shall be applicable to each off-airport property. 
Sec. 14-104. - Access taxiways. 
(a)  An off-airport user may, with the city manager's approval and with any approval as may be required of the FAA, TxDOT or any other regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the airport and subject to any and all laws, ordinances, rules, codes, regulations, policies, and standards of the city (whether currently in effect, hereafter adopted, or as may be amended, modified, changed, or superseded), construct, at the sole cost and expense of the off-airport user, an access taxiway to connect the off-airport property to a nearby taxiway located within the airport public area. The number, exact location and design specification of an access taxiway requested or constructed by an off-airport user shall be subject to the prior review and approval of the city manager (and the FAA, TxDOT, and any other regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the airport if so required), taking into consideration, among other things, operational safety and efficiency considerations and compatibility with the Addison Airport Master Plan as finally approved by the city from time to time. Plans and specifications for access taxiways shall be approved by the city manager prior to construction, and access taxiways shall be designed and constructed to meet or exceed the requirements of the projected use for said access taxiways. An off-airport user may be required by the city to plat an access taxiway within the off-airport property in accordance with law. 
(b)  Once constructed, inspected and accepted by the city, that portion of the access taxiway that lies within the airport shall become the sole property of the city and shall immediately become a part of the airport public area unless, at the sole discretion of the city manager or airport director, public use and access is restricted for safety or operational reasons. Upon acceptance by the city, that potion of the access taxiway that lies within the airport shall thereafter be policed, maintained and repaired by the city at the city's sole cost and expense, save and except any abnormal wear and tear or abuse of the access taxiway on the airport evidenced by one or more off-airport access users who may, under said circumstances, be assessed by the city for all or a reasonable portion of the city's actual cost of repair(s). 
(c)  It shall be the responsibility of the off-airport user to maintain, repair or replace any portion of the access taxiway situated within the legal boundary of the respective off-airport property including, but not limited to, the taxiway surface and subsurface, storm drainage, directional signs, lighting or other navigational aids, fencing, gates/doors and locking devices. If in the opinion of the city manager or airport director, the portion of the access taxiway situated on the off-airport property is unsafe or presents an operational or safety hazard to the airport or any user of the airport, the city manager or airport director may, at their respective sole discretion: 
(1)  Take whatever commercially reasonable actions deems necessary to remedy the unsafe condition, and any and all costs thereof shall be reimbursed to the city by the off-airport user; or 
(2)  After giving written notice to the off-airport user of not less than 15 days, the city manager may suspend off-airport access from the off-airport property until the unsafe condition is corrected to the satisfaction of the city. 
Sec. 14-105. - Prohibited uses. 
(a)  The sale of fuel for aviation or other purposes and activities in connection therewith on, from or in connection with the use of an off-airport property is strictly prohibited unless conducted directly by a licensed fueler holding a valid and current Addison Airport fuel-dispensing license issued by the city. No person, including, without limitation, an off-airport user, any person or entity related thereto, and any tenant, subtenant, or licensee thereof, shall be permitted or allowed to self-fuel or sell fuel (whether on or off the airport) for aviation or any other purpose at or in connection with any off-airport property. 
(b)  The use of an off-airport property is subject to applicable zoning regulations and all other applicable laws, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations, and standards of the city and any other governmental entity having jurisdiction over the off-airport property. 
Sec. 14-106. - Access permit. 
(a)  Application. The owner of the fee simple title of an off-airport property who desires access to the airport from an off-airport property shall make application (the "application") to the Airport Director.

If the application for an access permit is complete and if the applicant has provided all information or materials as may be required by an access permit, and if the applicant is current on any and all City taxes, fees, charges, assessments, or fines and in compliance with, and the issuance of the permit will be consistent and in conformity with, the Airport Master Plan (as applicable), the Minimum Standards for the Conduct of Commercial Aeronautical Activities (applicable to commercial aviation use), and all applicable laws, ordinances, codes, rules, standards, guidelines, policies, and regulations, grant assurances, and grant agreements of the City, then the City manager may issue and execute an access permit on behalf of the City. The City Manager's determination of issuance and execution of an access permit shall be made within 30 days after the City Manager's receipt of the application and all materials, and information described herein (or, if the approval or consent of the FAA or other State or Federal agency, entity, or authority is appropriate, necessary or required, such longer period of time as may be needed to obtain such approval or consent, if any). Written notice of the City Manager's determination shall be provided to the applicant. 
(d)  Contents of access permit; periodic recertification; amendment. The access permit shall identify the use and/or intended use of the off-airport property (i.e., either a recreational/incidental business use or a commercial aeronautical use), specify the size of the off-airport property (for a commercial aviation use only) and the fee to be paid in connection with any off-airport access, identify and specify all aircraft to be stored or based at the off-airport property by stating each aircraft's registration number ("N" number), make, model and the aircraft owner's name and contact information, require compliance with the Minimum Standards for the Conduct of Commercial Aeronautical Activities (in the case of a commercial aviation use), and shall contain such other terms, conditions, and requirements as the City Manager or Airport Director may deem appropriate (including, without limitation, insurance and indemnity requirements, no assignment or other transfer without the City's prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, and not to be withheld on the basis of a lawful use of the off-airport property existing as of July 10, 2007), default, termination and remedies therefor, standards regarding environmental matters, authorized uses, standards and requirements regarding Addison special events, late charges and interest, and compliance with the terms and conditions of this Division). An access permit may not be sold, assigned, sublet, pledged, conveyed, or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of the City. Periodically, the Airport Director may request an off-airport user to recertify the off-airport user's access permit by affirming the authorized users, registered aircraft, contact information, updated emergency and security plan, size of off-airport property (for a commercial aviation use only), permitted use or other terms and conditions of this Division. 
(e)  Revocation; access prevented; reinstatement. 
(1)  The Airport Director may revoke, cancel or terminate the access permit and access from an off-airport property of any off-airport user: 
a.  Who fails to pay the applicable fee, or fails to comply with any provision of the access permit, this Division, and any applicable laws, rules, codes, standards, regulations, policies, or permits, and including, without limitation, fails to comply with the Minimum Standards for the Conduct of Commercial Aeronautical Activities (applicable to commercial aviation use); or 
b.  Who fails to pay prior to delinquency the lawfully assessed and levied City ad valorem taxes on the applicable off-airport property; or 
c.  Who fails to use or discontinues the use of the off-airport property that is the subject of the access permit for a recreational/incidental business use or commercial aviation use as described in the access permit (except as provided for in Section 14-107(f), below); or 
d.  As otherwise set forth in the access permit. 
(2)  If access from an off-airport property to the airport is revoked, canceled, or terminated, the City shall secure the airport by erecting a fence or other barrier to prevent access to the airport from the off-airport property. If a fence or other barrier is erected, the affected off-airport owner shall, prior to and as a condition of reinstatement of access from the off-airport property to the airport, reimburse the City for all costs (including, without limitation, attorney's fees) incurred by or on behalf of the City to collect any amounts due for access, to erect and/or remove a fence or other barrier, and other applicable costs. 
(3)  Any revoked, canceled, or terminated access permit and access to the airport from an off-airport property may be reinstated only after the Airport Director has determined that sufficient extenuating circumstances exist to merit consideration for reinstatement, and upon payment of any outstanding fees or costs plus interest as may be required, the correction of any noncompliance, and/or the payment of any such taxes plus all penalties and interest, as applicable. Access to the airport shall be reinstated within 72 hours following the Airport Director's determination of the same. 
(f)  Term. Subject to the provisions, terms and conditions of this Division and an access permit and except as provided below in this subsection (f), an access permit shall be issued for a term of 25 years (the "initial term"). At the end of the initial term, an access permit shall be automatically renewed for an additional period of 15 years (the "renewal term"). Thereafter, an access permit may be renewed in accordance with the Airport Master Plan (as applicable) and applicable laws, ordinances, rules, standards, codes, guidelines, policies, regulations, grant assurances, and grant agreements. 
    The term of an access permit issued after November 12, 2013, shall be based on the then current guidelines for the length of a term that have been developed and approved by the City Manager in consultation with the Airport Director, which guidelines shall include criteria and standards that reflect a length of term based on the amount and nature of capital investment made in facilities to be used for aviation purposes in connection with the access permit. The minimum term of such permit shall be ten years with an automatic renewal period of five years and the maximum term of such permit shall be 25 years with an automatic renewal period of 15 years (the renewal period of such permit, whether five years or otherwise, being a "modified renewal term"). Thereafter, an access permit may be renewed in accordance with the Airport Master Plan (as applicable) and applicable laws, ordinances, rules, standards, codes, guidelines, policies, regulations, grant assurances, and grant agreements. 
(g)  Renewals/extensions of access permit. A renewal and/or extension of an access permit may be considered (but not necessarily authorized or granted, which shall be in the City's sole discretion) by the City as long as: 
(1)  The City will still own and control the airport during the modified term; 
(2)  The continuation of the off-airport access is, in the City's sole discretion, desirable for the City or the airport; 
(3)  Is consistent with the City's and/or airport purposes and objectives; 
(4)  No more than 15 years (or five years for an access permit issued after November 12, 2013) remain under the prevailing term and such renewal or extension does not exceed any duration of term authorized by law; 
(5)  Is in compliance and accordance with the terms, conditions, and standards set forth in this Division.

Sec. 14-107. - Fee calculation; time of payment; penalty for late payment. 
(a)  Determination of airport public area maintenance rate. On or before December 1, 2006 and on or before December 1 of every other year thereafter (e.g., 2008, 2010, etc.), the airport director shall determine the airport public area maintenance rate. 
(b)  Adjustment to the airport public area maintenance rate. In order to, among other things, promote the economic development and use of the airport and the development of aeronautical properties adjacent to the airport and for other proper and beneficial purposes, in the discretion of the city the then applicable airport public area maintenance rate may be adjusted by reducing the same in an amount determined appropriate by the city (the "adjusted airport public area maintenance rate"). The adjusted airport public area maintenance rate shall become effective on January 1 of the year next following such determination, and shall be used to establish the access fee for any new or extended access permit issued while it is in effect. 
(c)  Access fee. 
(1)  Commercial aviation use. For each off-airport property where the stated aviation use is a commercial aviation use, the access fee shall be calculated as follows (the "commercial aviation use access fee formula"): 
Adjusted Airport Public Area Maintenance Rate (then applicable) 
x (times) 
Off-Airport Property (gross land area in square feet) 
= 
Access Fee for Commercial Aviation Use 
(2)  Recreational/incidental business use. For each off-airport property where the stated use is a recreational/incidental business use, giving due regard and consideration to the airport public area and the airport public area expenses, the access fee shall be calculated at a rate and/or set in an amount which is smaller than the rate and/or amount of the fee for a commercial aviation use. 
Example (Commercial Aviation Use): 
Total Airport Expenses (Airport Enterprise Fund) $3,851,878.00  Less Non-Public Airport Facilities Expenses 
(including cost allocations provided for in subparagraph (ii) of the definition of airport public area expenses set forth in this division) ($1,273,527.00)  Less Public Revenue Offset ($746,293.00)  Plus Five-Year CIP Reserve Allowance $871,808.00 Airport Public Area Expenses $2,703,866.00 Square Footage of all Non-Public Airport Facilities and Total Off-Airport Properties 9,232,967 Sq. Ft. Airport Public Area Maintenance Rate (Airport Public Area Expenses ° square footage of all Non-Public Airport Facilities and Total Off-Airport Properties) $0.29/Sq. Ft. Adjusted Airport Public Area Maintenance Rate $0.08/Sq. Ft. Square Footage of Specific Off-Airport Property (Stated Aviation Use is a Commercial Aviation Use) 20,000 square feet Access Fee for Off-Airport Property (Paid Annually, Subject to Adjustment) 20,000 square feet × $0.08 = $1,600.00  
(d)  Payment. The initial access fee shall be due and payable in accordance with subsection 14-106(b), (but in any event, not later than the time of issuance of an access permit); airport access shall not be permitted prior to the issuance of the access permit and until the said fee is paid. Thereafter, the access fee shall be paid in advance on or before the following payment date(s): 
If an access fee is less than $5,000.00 annually, payment of the access fee shall be made on or before January 1 of each year; if an access fee is $5,000.00 or more annually, payment may be made in not fewer than two equal installments, each installment being due on or before January 1 and July 1 of each year. A penalty may be assessed for a late payment in addition to the city's cost of collecting any such delinquent sum. 
(e)  Modification of size of off-airport property. If the total square footage of an off-airport property (having as its stated aviation use a commercial aviation use) is legally modified (including any platting or re-platting as may required) (i.e., the legal description has been changed or altered)), the off-airport user owning the off-airport property shall promptly report in writing such modification to the city. Upon such notice, the access permit shall be amended to reflect the modified land area and applicable access fee, and a pro-rata adjustment to the access fee shall be made as appropriate. 
(f)  Modification of off-airport use. If an access permit is issued for an off-airport property having a commercial aviation use as its stated aviation use, and the stated aviation use is subsequently changed to a recreational/incidental business use, the off-airport user owning the off-airport property shall report the same in writing to the airport director, and the airport director shall investigate the report and if the airport director concludes that such use has in fact changed, the access permit shall be amended to reflect the change in use and the modification of the access fee, if any, and a pro-rata adjustment to the access fee shall be made as appropriate. 
If an off-airport user desires to change its recreational/incidental business use access permit to a commercial aviation use, the off-airport user shall submit a written request to the airport director, which request shall be considered and processed in accordance with and as provided for in section 14-106. If the city approves the requested change, the access permit shall be amended to reflect the change in use and an adjustment to the access fee, and a pro-rata adjustment to the access fee shall be made as appropriate. 
(g)  Adjustment to access fee. 
(1)  Commencing on January 1 of the second year next following the year of the effective date of an access permit and every two years thereafter (hereinafter referred to as the "adjustment date"), the access fee shall be adjusted as follows (a "CPI adjustment"): 
a.  The access fee shall be adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumers' Price Index - All Items for Dallas, Texas Metropolitan Area (hereinafter referred to as the "Consumer Price Index"), as quoted in the publication Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the Dallas-Fort Worth Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area which is issued by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. The basic index ("basic index") is the consumer price index existing on January 1 of the year in which an access permit is effective. The current index ("current index") is the consumer price index on the first day of the calendar month preceding the then applicable adjustment date. 
b.  Beginning with the calendar year of the then applicable adjustment date, the access fee shall be adjusted so that it equals the product of the access fee multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the current index and the denominator of which is the basic index, but in no event shall such monthly rent ever be decreased below the initial amount of the access fee. 
c.  In the event that the price index is unavailable for whatever reason for the computations set forth hereinabove, another index approximating the price index as closely as feasible (as reasonably determined by the City) shall be substituted therefor. 
(2)  An access fee shall be further adjusted as follows: At or about the beginning of the automatic renewal term or the modified renewal term, as applicable (as defined in subsection 14-106(f), above) and at or about the beginning of any additional renewals thereafter as may be approved by the City, the access fee shall be determined by recalculating the same in accordance with the provisions of this Division (e.g., for a commercial aviation use, the access fee shall be recalculated pursuant to the commercial aviation use access fee formula). Such access fee shall then be subject thereafter to the CPI adjustment as set forth in and in accordance with subsection (g)(i) of this section. 
(h)  Initial access fees. Initial access fees are as follows: 
(1)  For December 1, 2006, the airport director has determined the airport public area maintenance rate to be $0.29 per square foot. The adjusted airport public area maintenance rate for the first two-year period, commencing January 1, 2007 is hereby set at $0.08 per square foot. Access fees for commercial aviation uses for such period shall be determined in accordance with the commercial aviation use access fee formula. 
(2)  For each off-airport property where the aviation use is a recreational/incidental business use, the access fee shall be $750.00.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 14-122. - Zones. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surface and conical surface as they apply to Addison Airport. Such zones are shown on zoning map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Riewe & Wischmeyer, Inc., and dated April 1979, which is attached to this article and made a part hereof by reference. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Approach zones. Approach zone is established beneath the approach surface at the end of Runway 15/33 on Addison Airport for 50:1 landings and take-offs. The inner edge of the approach zone shall have a width of 1,000 feet which coincides with the width of the primary surface at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet beyond each end of the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established beneath the transition surface adjacent to each runway and approach surface as indicated on the zoning map. Transition surfaces, symmetrically located on either side of runways, have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transitional surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven to one from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of approach surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at right angles to the runway centerline. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. The area beneath a horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of the runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. 
(4)  Conical zone. The area beneath the conical surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to one for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. 
(Code 1982, § 2.1-13) 
Sec. 14-123. - Height limitations. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and no object of natural growth shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this article to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Approach zones. Runway 15/33: One foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the elevation of the primary surface and extending to a point 10,000 feet from the end of the primary surface, then rising one foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance for an additional 40,000 feet from the end of the primary surface. 
(2)  Transition zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 643 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation, or a height of 793 feet above mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation. 
(5)  Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this article shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any object of natural growth or structure to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the land.

Nothing contained in any of the exceptions in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any object of natural growth in excess of any of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in subsection 14-123(5). 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of any airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or object of natural growth to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived or any amendments to this article or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed.

The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 241.

2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship by rendering the lot undevelopable. 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
4.  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood hazard. 
5.  Submission to the applicant of written notice specifying the difference between the design flood elevation and the elevation to which the building is to be built, stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation, and stating that construction below the design flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

    Satellite earth station means an accessory structure for the principal use of receiving communications from a transmitter or transmitter relay located in planetary orbit. 
(Code 1982, § 5-284) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 18-652. - Purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds that the maintenance and integrity of neighborhood beauty is important to all citizens. The uncontrolled proliferation of receive-only satellite television antennas is likely and such proliferation will adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the town. Receive-only satellite earth stations are distinct from conventional television and/or radio antennas in that satellite television earth stations: 
(1)  Are less likely to blend in with their surroundings, thereby creating visual blight and potentially reducing the economic value of adjacent properties; and 
(2)  Create safety concerns as a result of their size (e.g., such earth stations may be subject to a high amount of wind force as a result of the shape of the earth station; therefore, both the satellite dish and the supporting structure must be constructed in a manner that will allow for great amounts of wind force). 
(b)  This article is adopted for these reasons and based upon these findings. 
(Code 1982, § 5-283)

(b)  A satellite earth station which is one meter or less in diameter: 
(1)  Which is to be located or placed on property which is zoned for residential use shall not be required to comply with subsections (a)(1) or (a)(4) of this section; provided, however, that no such satellite earth station shall be located or placed on or within property so that the satellite earth station is visible from a public street or other public right-of-way (exclusive of public alleys); or 
(2)  Which is to be located or placed on property zoned for commercial or industrial use shall be exempt from the terms of this article.

Sec. 34-177. - Triggering criteria for initiation and termination of drought response stages. 
    The city purchases 100 percent of its potable water from the City of Dallas. Therefore, the emergency water management triggering measures will be the same as those of the City of Dallas. Also, triggering criteria may be initiated as a result of short term deficiencies and or emergencies specific to the Town of Addison. 
    Following are the triggering criteria for initiation and termination of drought response stages: 
Stage 1 
Triggering criteria: Total raw water supply in connected lakes drops below 65 percent of total conservation storage, demand exceeds 85 percent of deliverable capacity for four consecutive days, short term deficiencies in distribution system limit supply capability, or natural or man-made contamination of the water supply source(s) occurs. 
Below are examples of the types of triggering criteria that might be used in a drought contingency plan. One or a combination of such criteria may be defined for each drought response stage: 
Example 1: When, pursuant to requirements specified in the city wholesale water purchase contract with the City of Dallas, notification is received requesting initiation of Stage 1 of the drought contingency plan. 
Example 2: Continually falling treated water reservoir levels which do not refill above 60 percent overnight (e.g., based on an evaluation of minimum treated water storage required to avoid system outage). 
Goal for use reduction and action available under Stage 1: 
The goal for water use reduction under Stage 1 is a five-percent voluntary reduction in water use that would have occurred in the absence of drought contingency measures. The city manager may order the implementation of any of the actions listed below, as deemed necessary: 
  The city manager requests voluntary reductions in water use. 
  Prohibit residential or commercial lawn watering and car washing between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. 
  Accelerate public information efforts to teach and encourage reduced water use. 
  Staff will begin a review of the problems which initiated the Stage 1 actions. 
  Intensify efforts on leak detection and repair. 
  Notify major water users and work with them to achieve voluntary water use reduction. 
  Reduce city government use of water for street washing, vehicle washing, operation of ornamental fountains and all other nonessential use. 
  Request a reduction in landscape watering by city government. 
Termination criteria: All initiated actions will remain in effect until the conditions which triggered Stage 1 have been alleviated and would be unlikely to recur upon termination. If Stage 1 is initiated because of excessive demands, all initiated actions will remain in effect until the city manager or the director of Dallas Water Utilities determines that these measures are no longer required. 
Stage 2 
Triggering criteria: Total raw water supply in connected lakes drops below 55 percent of total conservation storage or demand exceeds 90 percent of deliverable capacity for three consecutive days, or short term deficiencies in distribution system limit supply capability, or natural or man-made contamination of the water supply source(s) occurs. Stage 2 actions will not ordinarily be taken until Stage 1 actions have first been implemented. 
Goals for reduction and actions available under Stage 2. 
The goal for water use reduction under Stage 2 is a 15-percent reduction in the use that would have occurred in the absence of drought contingency measures. All requirements implemented under Stage 1 shall remain in effect during Stage 2, and the city manager may order the implementation of any of the actions listed below, as deemed necessary: 
  Prohibit hosing off of paved areas, buildings or windows; operation of swimming pool draining followed by refilling, washing or rinsing vehicles by hose; using water in such a manner as to allow runoff or other water wastes. 
Exceptions: Vehicles may be washed or rinsed with a hose at commercial car washes; vehicles may be washed at any location with a bucket or other container. 
  Limit landscape watering at each service address to two days per week based on the last digit of the address per the schedule below. 
Last Digit 
of Address Allowed 
Water 
Days Odd-numbered address Tuesday and Saturday Even-numbered address Wednesday and Sunday  
Apartments, office building complexes or other property containing multiple addresses will be identified by the lowest address number. 
Where there are no numbers, a number will be assigned by the city manager. These restrictions also apply to government facilities. 
Exceptions: Foundations and new plantings (first year) of trees and shrubs may be watered with a hand-held or soaker hose on any day for up to two hours; nurseries may water plant stock only without restrictions; public gardens may water twice per week on Mondays and Fridays. 
Enforcement: Violations of restrictions will result in a warning, and then a citation may be issued with a fine not to exceed $2,000.00 per incident. 
Termination criteria: All initiated actions will remain in effect until the conditions which triggered Stage 2 have been alleviated and would be unlikely to recur upon termination. If Stage 2 is initiated because of excessive demands, all initiated actions will remain in effect until the city manager or the director of Dallas Water Utilities determines that conditions exist which will allow removal of Stage 2 actions. 
Stage 3 
Triggering criteria: Total raw water supply in connected lakes drops below 45 percent of total conservation storage, demand exceeds 95 percent of deliverable capacity for two consecutive days, short term deficiencies in distribution system limit supply capability, or natural or manmade contamination of the water supply source(s) occurs. Stage 3 actions will not ordinarily be taken until Stage 2 actions have first been implemented. 
Goals for reduction and actions available under Stage 3. 
The goal for water use reduction under Stage 3 is a 20-percent reduction in the use that would have occurred in the absence of drought contingency measures. All requirements implemented in Stages 1 and 2 shall remain in effect, and the city manager may order the implementation of any of the actions listed below, as deemed necessary: 
  Commercial and residential landscape watering will be limited to foundations, shrubs, and trees, which may be watered with soaker or hand-held hose on the same two days per week basis set forth in the schedule in Stage 2 above for up to two hours. 
  Public gardens may water on the same two days per week basis set forth in the schedule in Stage 2 above. 
  Nurseries may water plant stock only between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. 
  Prohibit operations of ornamental fountains, except where necessary to support aquatic life or where equipped with a recirculation system. 
Enforcement: Violations of restrictions will result in a warning, and then a citation may be issued with a fine not to exceed $2,000.00 per incident. 
Termination criteria: All initiated actions will remain in effect until the conditions which triggered Stage 3 have been alleviated and would be unlikely to recur upon termination. If Stage 3 is initiated because of excessive demands, all initiated actions will remain in effect until the city manager or the director of Dallas Water Utilities determines that conditions exist which will allow removal of Stage 3 actions. 
Stage 4 
Triggering criteria: Total raw water supply in connected lakes drops below 30 percent of total conservation storage, demand exceeds 98 percent of deliverable capacity for one day, short term deficiencies in distribution system limit supply capability, or natural or man-made contamination of the water supply source(s) occurs. Stage 4 actions will not ordinarily be taken until Stage 3 actions have first been implemented. 
Goals for reduction and actions available under Stage 4: 
The goal for water use reduction under Stage 4 is a 25-percent reduction in the use that would have occurred in the absence of drought contingency measures. If circumstances warrant or if required by Dallas Water Utilities ("DWU"), city manager can set a goal for a greater water use reduction. 
The city manager must implement any action(s) required by DWU. In addition, the city manager may order the implementation of any of the actions listed below, as deemed necessary. All requirements implemented in Stages 1, 2 and 3 shall remain in effect during Stage 4. Measures described as "requires notification to TCEQ" impose mandatory requirements on customers. The supplier must notify TCEQ within five business days if these measures are implemented: 
  Prohibit all commercial and residential landscape watering with the following exceptions: 
  Nurseries' plant stock may be watered between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. two days per week, based on the last digit of their address per the schedule in Stage 2.

  Foundations may be watered for a two-hour period between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. with a soaker or hand-held hose on the two day per week basis prescribed for landscape watering in Stage 2. 
  Any and all washing of vehicles is prohibited. 
  All commercial water users may be required to reduce water consumption by a percentage determined by the city manager. 
Enforcement: Violations of restrictions will result in a warning, and then a citation may be issued with a fine not to exceed $2,000.00 per incident. 
Termination criteria: All initiated actions will remain in effect until the conditions which triggered Stage 4 have been alleviated and are unlikely to recur upon termination. If Stage 4 is initiated because of excessive demands, all initiated actions will remain in effect until the city manager or the director of Dallas Water Utilities determines that conditions exist which will allow removal of Stage 4 actions. 
Stage 5 
(a)  System outage due to major water system components-Triggering criteria: A system outage to one of the town's two water pump stations, which are located at each end of town. In the event of such outage, the second pump station will be used. In addition, the Town of Addison has four City of Dallas emergency stand-by meters connected to the town's distribution system that can be used to supplement the town's supply after notification to the City of Dallas. 
Goals for reduction and actions available under Stage 5: 
The goal for water use reduction under Stage 5 is a reduction to prevent public health emergencies that would have occurred in the absence of drought contingency measures. If circumstances warrant or if required by Dallas Water Utilities ("DWU"), city manager can set a goal for a greater water use reduction. 
The city manager must implement any action(s) required by DWU. In addition, the city manager may order the implementation of any of the actions listed below, or other actions not included, as deemed necessary.

ARTICLE VI. - LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS 

Sec. 34-201. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this Article is to provide landscape elements which: 
  Conserve water; 
  Aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, and (stormwater) runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement; 
  Assist in providing adequate light and air and preventing overcrowding of land; 
  Be an integral part of development, not an afterthought; 
  Provide visual buffering and enhance the beautification of the Town; 
  Safeguard and enhance property values and to protect public and private investments; 
  Preserve and protect the unique identity and environment of the Town of Addison and preserve the economic base attracted to the Town of Addison by such factors; 
  Conserve energy; 
  Protect the public; 
  Provide wildlife habitat. 
    The Town of Addison encourages sustainable landscaping. Sustainable landscapes are managed by using practices that preserve limited and costly natural resources, reduce waste generation, and help prevent air, water, and soil pollution. The goal is to minimize environmental impacts and maximize value received from dollars expended. 
(b)  The following shall be used to evaluate proposed landscape plans: 
(1)  The landscape design should have proportion, balance, unity, variety of species, and a variety of color through the seasons. 
(2)  Landscape designs should define spaces including entrance areas, pedestrian paths, vehicular avenues, parking areas, sitting areas, etc. 
(3)  As an architectural feature, landscape designs should visually soften the mass of the buildings, parking areas, and other structures. 
(4)  Native landscape materials should be selected as much as is possible. 
(5)  Landscaping should reduce the reliance on irrigation, thus conserving the public water supply, and reduce the reliance on inorganic fertilizer and pesticides; thus reducing the amounts carried off by runoff to lakes and streams.

Sec. 42-32. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year, also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a non-basement building (i) built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, and V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date.

    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS): See flood elevation study. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding).

    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

(b)  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."

    National Flood Insurance Program Regulations means those regulations contained in Chapter 1 of Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) pertaining to floodplain management. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank and a manufactured home, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the building official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

DIVISION 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 42-76. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required: 
(1)  Anchoring. All new construction or substantial improvements must be designed (or modified) in such a manner that they are adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
(2)  Construction materials and methods. 
a.  All new construction or substantial improvements must be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
b.  All new construction or substantial improvements must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. 
(3)  Utilities. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements must be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
b.  All new and replacement water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
c.  All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system, and to minimize or eliminate discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
d.  On-site waste disposal systems must be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 001-005, § 2(Exh. A), 1-9-01) 
Sec. 42-77. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in section 42-37, regarding the basis for establishing the area of special flood hazard, subsection (8) of section 42-57, pertaining to the use of other base flood data, or subsection (3) of section 42-78, pertaining to standards for subdivision proposals, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that this standard is satisfied. The administrator shall maintain a record of such certification. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure must either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify to the floodplain administrator that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this article. A record of such certification that includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed must be maintained by the administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding, must be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding must be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices must permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on the FHBM or FIRM must be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4)b. of this section must be elevated so that either: 
i.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
ii.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and are securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the FIRM must either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of section 42-59, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 001-005, § 2(Exh. A), 1-9-01; Ord. No. 008-030, § 1.A.6, 8-26-08) 
Sec. 42-78. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, must meet development permit requirements of this article. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data must be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, that is greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 42-37 regarding the basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard or subsection (8) section 42-57 pertaining to the use of other base flood data. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, must have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals, including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, must have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 001-005, § 2(Exh. A), 1-9-01) 
Sec. 42-79. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-37, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures must have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures must: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section are satisfied. 
(4)  Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths must be provided around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 001-005, § 2(Exh. A), 1-9-01) 
Sec. 42-80. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-37, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, within the adopted regulatory floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the town during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section 42-80 is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements must comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 001-005, § 2(Exh. A), 1-9-01; Ord. No. 008-030, § 1.A.7, 8-26-08) 
Sec. 42-81. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter.

Sec. 62-32. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  It is the declared purpose of this article that in time all privately owned signs shall either conform to the provisions of this chapter or be removed. By the passage of this chapter and its amendments, no presently illegal sign shall be deemed to have been legalized unless such sign complies with all current standards under the terms of this chapter and all other ordinances of the town. Any sign which does not conform to all provisions of this chapter shall be a nonconforming sign if it legally existed as a conforming or nonconforming sign under the terms of this chapter under prior ordinances, or an illegal sign if it did not exist as a conforming or nonconforming sign under prior ordinances, or an illegal sign if it did not exist as a conforming or nonconforming sign, as the case may be. 
(b)  No nonconforming sign shall be repaired or renovated except to bring the sign into compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Any nonconforming signs which are damaged in excess of 50 percent of its current value must be demolished and not repaired unless such proposed repairs would bring the sign into compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(c)  The town will follow all applicable state regulations in the removal of nonconforming signs. Upon requirement of removal, the town will institute any necessary procedures before any legal boards required by state legislation.

Payment of the late fee does not excuse full compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  The following procedures apply to a meritorious exception: 
(1)  In the development of the sign criteria, a primary objective has been to ensure against the kind of signage that has led to low visual quality. On the other hand, an equally primary objective has been guarding against overly controlled signage. 
(2)  It is not the intention of these criteria to discourage innovation. It is entirely conceivable that signage proposals could be made that, while clearly not conforming to this chapter and thus not allowable under these criteria, have obvious merit in not only being appropriate to the particular site or location, but also in making a positive contribution to the visual environment. 
(3)  The council may consider appeals on the basis that such regulations and/or standards will, by reason of exceptional circumstances or surroundings, constitute a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship or on the basis that the proposed improvement although falling under the definition of a "sign," constitutes art that makes a positive contribution to the visual environment.

IV-VIII. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 70-35. - Administration; ordinance construction; purpose; objectives. 
(a)  Administration. This article shall be known and cited as the Right-of-Way Management Ordinance for the Town of Addison, Texas. The City Manager appoints the Director of Infrastructure and Development Services, or his/her designee, as the principal Town official responsible for the administration of the right-of-way, right-of-way permits, the regulation of same and ordinances related thereto. The Director may delegate any or all of the duties hereunder. The Director shall have the duties, responsibilities and authority as specified herein. 
(b)  Construction. This Article shall be construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas and the City Charter and Code of Ordinances to the extent that such Charter and Code of Ordinances are not in conflict with or in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States or the State of Texas. All obligations of the parties hereunder are performable in Dallas County. 
(c)  Purpose. This article provides principles and procedures for the placement of structures and facilities, construction, excavation, encroachments, and work activities within or upon any public right-of-way and to protect the integrity of the road and Town utility system. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to require permits of private users of the public rights-of-way, except as prohibited by law, and to establish permit procedures, rules, and regulations for work done within or upon the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  Objectives. Public and private uses of public rights-of-way for location of facilities employed in the provision of public services should, in the interests of the general welfare, be accommodated; however, the Town must insure that the primary purpose of the rights-of-way, safe passage of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest extent possible. In addition, the value of other public and private installations, roadways, the Town utility system, facilities and properties should be protected, competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety preserved. The use of the public right-of-way by persons, agencies, network providers, and public infrastructure contractors is secondary to these public objectives and the movement of traffic. This article is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use of public rights-of-way for location of facilities by public and private entities. The article thus has several objectives: 
(1)  To ensure the public safety is maintained and that public inconvenience is minimized. 
(2)  To protect the Town's infrastructure investment by establishing repair standards for the pavement, facilities, and property in the public rights-of-way when work is accomplished. 
(3)  To facilitate work within the public rights-of-way through the standardization of regulations. 
(4)  To maintain an efficient and applicable permitting process. 
(5)  To conserve and fairly apportion the limited physical capacity of the public rights-of-way held in public trust by the Town. 
(6)  To preserve the substantial effort on the part of the Town to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the public right-of-way. 
(7)  To establish a public policy for enabling the Town to discharge its public trust consistent with the rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory policies, industry competition and technological development. 
(8)  To promote cooperation among the agencies, network providers, and public infrastructure contractors (as defined herein) and the Town in the occupation of the public rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to: (i) eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or unsightly; (ii) lower the agencies, network provider's, public infrastructure contractors', if possible, and the Town's costs of providing services to the public; and (iii) preserve the physical integrity of the streets and highways by minimizing street cuts. 
(9)  To assure that the Town can continue to fairly and responsibly protect the public health, safety and welfare.

(a)  Maximum use shall be made of vegetation to minimize soil loss. 
(b)  Natural vegetation should be retained wherever possible. 
(c)  Where inadequate natural vegetation exists, or where it becomes necessary to remove existing natural vegetation, temporary controls should be installed promptly to minimize soil loss and ensure that erosion and sedimentation does not occur. 
(d)  Wherever possible during construction, erosion and sedimentation controls shall be used on hillsides to slow drainage flow rate. 
(e)  Erosion and sedimentation control elements should be implemented as soon as practical in the development process. Erosion and sedimentation controls shall be maintained by the responsible party. Erosion and sedimentation controls that are installed but not properly maintained in accordance with the Erosion Control Manual shall be considered a violation of this chapter. 
(f)  Waste or disposal areas and construction roads should be located and constructed in a manner that will minimize the amount of sediment entering streams. 
(g)  Frequent fording of live streams will not be permitted; therefore, temporary bridges or other structures shall be used wherever an appreciable number of stream crossings are necessary. 
(h)  When work areas or material sources are located in or adjacent to live streams, such areas shall be separated from the stream by a dike or other barrier to keep sediment from entering a flowing stream. Care shall be taken during the construction and removal of such barriers to minimize the sediment transport into a stream. 
(i)  Should preventative measures fail to function effectively, the applicant shall act immediately to bring the erosion and/or siltation under control by whatever additional means are necessary. 
(j)  Erosion control devices shall be placed to trap any losses from stockpiled topsoil. 
(k)  The selection and timing of the installation of erosion controls shall be based upon weather and seasonal conditions that could make certain controls not practicable. 
(l)  Vegetation used for vegetative cover shall be suitable for local soil and weather conditions. Groundcover plants shall comply with listings from the Texas Agricultural Extension Service for North Central Texas. 
(m)  Runoff shall be diverted away from construction areas as much as possible. 
(n)  Stripping of vegetation from project sites shall be phased so as to expose the minimum amount of area to soil erosion for the shortest possible period of time. Phasing shall also consider the varying requirements of an erosion control plan at different stages of construction. 
(o)  Developers, builders, or owners of property shall install all utilities, including franchise utilities, before final acceptance of a subdivision, property and/or structure. Final acceptance will also be contingent upon having all necessary erosion control measures installed to minimize off-site sediment. A site may be accepted without erosion control measures if perennial vegetative cover is actively growing at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.

Sec. 72-14. - Access to facilities. 
(a)  The authorized enforcement personnel shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities and premises subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the authorized enforcement personnel. 
(b)  Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement personnel ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES or TPDES Permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.

Sec. 82-173.6. - Dilution. 
    No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The environmental services official may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-173.7. - Plant loading. 
    No industry shall discharge wastewater containing a BOD or TSS loading that causes the city's prorata share of the total BOD or TSS loading to the POTW System to exceed the city's prorata share of the total flow to the POTW system. (Example: If the city contributes 25 percent of the total wastewater flow to the system, the city's cumulative BOD or TSS loading to the system, as measured at the city's points of entry to the system, shall not exceed 25 percent of the total BOD or TSS loading to the system.) 
    Any industry with a wastewater strength that will cause the city's cumulative wastewater loading, at the city's points of entry, to exceed the city's prorata share of the total wastewater loading based upon flow, shall be required to install pretreatment facilities to reduce its wastewater strength to an acceptable level. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-174. - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
Sec. 82-174.1. - Pretreatment facilities. 
    Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 82-173.1 of this division within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, the control authority, or the environmental services official, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the environmental services official for review, and shall be acceptable to the environmental services official before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the Town of Addison under the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-174.2. - Additional pretreatment measures. 
(a)  Whenever deemed necessary, the environmental services official may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and require such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this division. 
(b)  The environmental services official may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(c)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the environmental services official, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the environmental services official and shall be so located as to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense. 
(d)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter, or other control device as deemed necessary by the environmental services official.

Sec. 82-180. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
Sec. 82-180.1. - Notification of violation. 
    When the environmental services official finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental services official may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within the time frame specified in the notice, which is usually, but not always, ten days, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the environmental services official. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the environmental services official to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-180.2. - Reserved. 
Sec. 82-180.3. - Show cause hearing. 
    The environmental services official may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the environmental services official and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-180.4. - Compliance orders. 
    When the environmental services official finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental services official may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-180.5. - Cease and desist orders. 
    When the environmental services official finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the environmental services official may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-180.6. - Reserved. 
Sec. 82-180.7. - Emergency suspensions. 
    The environmental services official may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The environmental services official may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the environmental services official may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The environmental services official may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the environmental services official that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 82-180.8 of this division are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the environmental services official prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 82-180.3 or 82-180.8 of this division. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-180.8. - Termination of discharge. 
    In addition to the provisions in section 82-175.13 of this division, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 82-173 of this division. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 82-180.3 of this division why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the environmental services official shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-181. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
Sec. 82-181.1. - Injunctive relief. 
    When the environmental services official finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the environmental services official may petition the appropriate court through the Town of Addison's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of the user. The environmental services official may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-181.2. - Civil penalties. 
(a)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Town of Addison for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(b)  The environmental services official may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Town of Addison. 
(c)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(d)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-181.3. - Criminal prosecution. 
(a)  A user who violates any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $2,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment as decided by an appropriate court, or both. 
(b)  A user who negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to the same penalties described in 82-181.3(a) of this division. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(c)  A user who makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this division, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division shall, upon conviction, be subject to the same penalties described in subsection 82-181.3(a) of this division. 
(d)  Criminal responsibility. A culpable mental state is not required to prove an offense under this division. A person is criminally responsible for a violation of this division if: 
(1)  The person commits or assists in the commission of a violation, or causes or permits another person to commit a violation; or 
(2)  The person owns or manages the property or facilities determined to be the cause of the illegal discharge under sections 82-173.1, 82-173.2, 82-173.4, 82-174.4, or 82-175.2. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-181.4. - Remedies nonexclusive. 
    The remedies provided for in this division are not exclusive. The environmental services official may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Town of Addison's Enforcement Response Plan on file in the city secretary's office. However, the environmental services official may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the environmental services official is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-181.5. - Applicability of more stringent regulations. 
(a)  If national pretreatment standards, categorical or otherwise, more stringent than the discharge limits prescribed in this article are promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for certain industries, the more stringent national pretreatment standards will apply to the affected industrial user. A violation of the more stringent national pretreatment standards will also be considered a violation of this division. 
(b)  Applicability of more stringent discharge limits. An industrial user within the city who discharges industrial waste ultimately received and treated by another governmental entity pursuant to a wholesale wastewater contract or a reciprocal agreement with the city is subject to the following additional rules: 
(1)  If the governmental entity has more stringent discharge limits than those prescribed herein, or by a discharge permit issued hereunder, because the United States Environmental Protection Agency requires the more stringent discharge limits as part of the governmental entity's wastewater pretreatment program, the more stringent discharge limits shall prevail. 
(2)  The environmental services official is authorized to issue a discharge permit to an industrial user affected by subsection (1), to insure notice of and compliance with the more stringent discharge limits. If the industrial user already has a discharge permit, the environmental services official may amend the permit to apply and enforce the more stringent discharge limits. An industrial user shall submit to the environmental services official an expected compliance date and an installation schedule if the more stringent discharge limits necessitate technological or mechanical adjustments to discharge facilities or plant processes. 
(3)  If the environmental services official chooses not to issue or amend a permit under subsection (2), the environmental services official shall notify the affected industrial user in writing of the more stringent discharge limits and their effective date. Regardless of whether or not a permit is issued or amended, an industrial user shall be given a reasonable opportunity to comply with the more stringent discharge limits. 
(4)  The more stringent discharge limits cease to apply upon termination of the city's wholesale wastewater contract or reciprocal agreement with the governmental entity, or upon modification or elimination of the limits by the government entity or the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The environmental services official shall take the appropriate action to notify the affected industrial user of an occurrence under this subsection (4). 
(c)  Variances in compliance dates. The environmental services official may grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry when, in the environmental services official's opinion, such action is necessary to achieve pretreatment or corrective measures. In no case shall the environmental services official grant a variance in compliance dates to an industry affected by national categorical pretreatment standards beyond the compliance dates established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
(d)  Authority to regulate. The environmental services official may establish regulations, not in conflict with this division or other laws, to control the disposal and discharge of industrial waste into the wastewater system and to insure compliance with the city's pretreatment enforcement program and with all applicable pretreatment regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The regulations established shall, where applicable, be made part of any discharge permit issued to an industrial user by the environmental services official. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-182. - Reserved. 
Sec. 82-183. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
Sec. 82-183.1. - In an action brought in federal court only: upset provision. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the environmental services official within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-183.2. - In an action brought in municipal or state court only: act of God provision. 
(a)  An event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe is not a violation. 
(b)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. 
(c)  In the event that (a) and (b) above has been demonstrated the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(Ord. No. 003-003, § 1, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 82-183.3. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the environmental services official, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the environmental services official of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The environmental services official may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the environmental services official may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2)  The environmental services official may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the environmental services official determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

Sec. 82-184. - Wastewater treatment rates [reserved]. 
Sec. 82-185. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
Sec. 82-185.1. - Pretreatment charges and fees. 
(a)  The Town of Addison may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the Town of Addison's Pretreatment Program which may include: 
(1)  Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications; 
(2)  Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
(3)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  Fees for filing appeals; and 
(5)  Other fees as the Town of Addison may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this division and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the Town of Addison. 
(6)  Fees for treating abnormal strength wastes 
(7)  Fees incurred from an upset, bypass or unauthorized discharge. 
(b)  Surcharge. The Town of Addison may surcharge industrial users for the treating of abnormal strength wastes. Water or wastes having 1) a five-day biochemical oxygen demand greater than 250 parts per million (ppm) by weight or 2) containing more than 250 parts per million by weight of total suspended solids shall be subject to the review and approval of the environmental services official. Where the environmental services official has approved the admission of (1) or (2) above into the POTW, that discharge may be subject to a surcharge as determined by the environmental services official. In no case shall a discharge be accepted that will prevent the POTW from meeting its limits. 
    The surcharge will be assessed according to the following formula each month using the most current pollutant concentration data and the current months' wastewater flow: 
Surcharge = Q x [a(BOD - x) + b(TSS - y)][8.34] 
1,000,000 
Where: 
Q = flow in gallons 
8.34 = weight in pounds of one gallon of water 
x = normal limits of BOD in domestic wastewater expressed in milligrams per liter 
y = normal limits of TSS in domestic wastewater expressed in milligrams per liter 
a = unit cost of treatment per pound of BOD 
b = unit cost of treatment per pound of TSS 
BOD = measured amount of BOD, in mg/L 
TSS = measured amount of TSS, in mg/L 
A surcharge is an additional charge by the POTW for the increased cost of handling discharge of unusual strength and character and shall not serve as a variance to the requirements of this division. Exercise of this provision shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

Sec. 82-266. - Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee, billing policies, and procedures. 
(a)  Stormwater (Drainage) Utility rate classes. A benefitted property within the service area shall be classified and charged a Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee based on the Stormwater (Drainage) Utility rate determined by the property's rate class and relative size compared to the ERU. Depending on the use of the benefitted property, the property shall be classified as one of the following rate classes: 
(1)  Residential property; or 
(2)  Nonresidential property. 
(b)  Responsible party. 
(1)  A customer or owner shall be billed monthly a Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee for Stormwater (Drainage) Utility services. The Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee shall be levied or charged, along with other municipal services (if any) provided, to the benefitted property, including water, wastewater or solid waste/refuse services. 
(2)  The utility bill imposing the Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee will be mailed to either the customer or owner, who is then currently identified by the Town as the responsible party for water, wastewater and/or solid waste/refuse service for the benefitted property; and the customer or owner recorded in the Town's utility or other billing system shall be responsible for payment of the Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee. 
(3)  If there is no active customer account for a benefitted property recorded in the Town's utility or other billing system, or if a benefitted property is considered by the Town to be vacant, either on a temporary or permanent basis, the Town may bill the owner of the benefitted property for the Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee. The owner of the benefitted property shall be responsible for payment of fees imposed via a stormwater-only account. 
(4)  If the Town does not bill a benefitted property for water service, wastewater service, or solid waste/refuse service, the Director may establish for that property a "stormwater-only account" and bill the owner or customer as the Director may determine is appropriate. 
(c)  Initial fee, rates; revision of fee, rates. The initial Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee and Stormwater (Drainage) Utility rates are or will be set forth in Division 2 of this Article, below. The City Council has and reserves the right to review the fee and rate schedules at any time and may, by ordinance, increase or decrease the Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee or rates within the schedule upon a determination that the increase or decrease is warranted. 
(d)  Billing procedures and policies. 
(1)  Any partial payment of the Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee shall be applied against the amount due in accordance with the policies and procedures established for utility services provided by the Town. 
(2)  A late charge and interest may be imposed in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Town for established utility services provided by the Town. 
(3)  A Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee that is imposed for a period of less than one month shall be prorated on the basis of the proportionate part of the period during which Stormwater (Drainage) Utility service was provided. 
(e)  Nonpayment. In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided at law, in the Act, or in this Article, a customer's or owner's failure to pay promptly when due the Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee shall subject the customer or owner to discontinuance of any utility services provided by the Town and/or the placement of a lien against the benefitted property that is the subject of such failure to pay to the extent authorized by law and this Article. Additionally, the Town may file suit to recover any Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fees, together with maximum interest, attorneys' fees and other costs and fees allowable under State or Federal law, that are not paid when due. 
(f)  Allocation of fee by residential and nonresidential multifamily properties. The owner, manager or operator of a residential property or of a nonresidential property with a multifamily use, such as an apartment complex or condominium complex that is not individually metered for each dwelling unit, may not bill or collect from its occupants or tenants thereof an amount that, collectively, exceeds the actual fee imposed on the said property. Any agreement between the owner, manager or operator of such property shall contain a clear written description of the method of calculation of the allocation of the fee for each of the occupants or tenants. However, the owner, manager or operator may charge an occupant or tenant a fee for late payment of an occupant's or tenant's allocated portion of the fee. The owner, manager, or operator shall maintain adequate records regarding the allocation of the fee to occupants or tenants of such property, and shall make such records available for inspection by such occupants or tenants during normal business hours.

(a)  Rates in accordance with the Act. The Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee and rates shall be established in accordance with the provisions of the Act and this Section. 
(b)  Fee calculation. The Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee shall be based on an inventory of parcels within the service area. The inventory shall evaluate the stormwater runoff potential for improved parcels within the service area and establish a rate for each class of benefitted properties. The stormwater runoff potential shall be equitably and proportionately distributed between classes and among the parcels within each class of benefitted properties relative to the contribution of each class to stormwater (drainage) runoff. Additionally, the stormwater runoff potential within a class may be subdivided into tiers that group together parcels with similarly sized impervious area on the parcel. 
(c)  Stormwater runoff potential. For purposes of establishing the stormwater runoff potential for each class of benefitted properties and between classes of benefitted properties, the Director shall calculate the impervious area for parcels within the service area based on data gathered from DCAD, Geographic Information System records, aerial photography, and site plans or plats available. The Director shall then determine the relative stormwater runoff potential for each rate class and among parcels within each rate class. The rate for each class of benefitted properties and for parcels within each class shall be based on the impervious area measured in square feet (SF). 
(d)  Property values. In calculating the Stormwater (Drainage) Utility fee and rates, property values may not be used.

ARTICLE XV. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 

Section 1. - Purpose of district. 
    The purpose of this district is to encourage better development in the town by allowing more flexibility in the planning and development of projects. Variable combinations of land use units such as industrial parks, office or commercial districts, mixed or uniform residential development, or other appropriate combination of uses will be allowed if developed and operated as integral land use units by a single owner or combination of owners. It is the policy of the town that the developer shall inventory site conditions and environs, both natural and manmade, and shall provide appropriate protection of these elements prior to approval of the planned development district. The district is further designed to allow the city council greater control over the development of areas adjacent to residential districts. 
Section 2. - Application. 
    An application for a planned development district may be made to the city planning and zoning commission in the same manner that an application for any amendment to the zoning ordinance is made. In addition to the requirements outlined in sections 4 and 5, the planning and zoning commission or the city council may require additional information or special plans related to specific elements of the planned development district. 
Section 3. - Uses permitted. 
    A planned development district may be approved for any use or combination of uses allowed under the zoning ordinance including special use permits. The uses permitted in any specific planned development district shall be enumerated in the ordinance establishing such districts. 
Section 4. - Development schedule. 
1.  An application for a planned development district shall, if the applicant desires or the planning and zoning commission or city council requires, be accompanied by a development schedule indicating the appropriate date on which construction is expected to begin and the rate of anticipated development to completion. The development schedule, if adopted and approved by the city council, shall become part of the development plan and shall be adhered to by the owner, developer and his successor in interest. The city council, in the ordinance approving the development schedule, may authorize the planning and zoning commission to extend the development schedule or adopt a new development schedule without additional public hearings. 
2.  Annually, where a development schedule has been required, the building official shall report to the city council the actual development accomplished in the various planned development districts as compared with the development schedules. 
3.  The planning and zoning commission may, if in its opinion the owner or owners of the property are failing or have failed to meet the approved schedule, initiate proceedings to rezone the planned development district by removing all or part of the planned development district from the zoning district map and recommending that the area involved be placed in another appropriate zoning district. This recommendation shall be passed to the city council as are other amendments to the zoning ordinance. 
4.  The owner or owners may, at any time, apply to the planning and zoning commission for an extension of the development schedule. Such application shall be acted upon by the planning and zoning commission and if the ordinance setting out the development schedules gives the authority to the planning and zoning commission to extend the development time, the action of the planning and zoning commission making the extension shall be final. In the event the planning and zoning commission denies the extension, the owner or owners of the property shall have a right of appeal to the city council and the rules for the amendment of the zoning ordinance shall apply and govern the handling of the appeal. 
Section 5. - Procedure for approval of development plan. 
1.  An applicant for a development of an area included under a planned development district, or one seeking to have an area designated as such a district, must submit a development plan which shall become part of the amending ordinance. Changes in the development plan shall be considered the same as changes in the zoning district map and shall be processed as required by zoning ordinance; except that changes of detail which do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property and which do not alter the uses permitted or increase the density, building height or coverage of the site, or which do not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site or does not significantly alter the landscape plans or signage as indicated on the approved development plan may be authorized by the zoning administrator. Any applicant may appeal the decision of the zoning administrator to the planning and zoning commission for review and decision as to whether an amendment to the planned development district ordinance shall be required. 
2.  The development plan shall include: 
(a)  A site inventory analysis including a scale drawing showing existing vegetation, natural watercourses, creeks or bodies of water and analysis of planned changes in such natural features as a result of the development. This should include a delineation of any flood prone areas. 
(b)  A scale drawing showing any proposed public or private streets and alleys; building sites or lots, and areas reserved as parks, parkways, playgrounds, utility easements, school sites, street widening and street changes; the points of ingress and egress from existing streets; general location and description of existing and proposed utility services, including size of water and sewer mains; the location and width of all curb cuts and the land area of all abutting sites and the zoning classification thereof on an accurate survey of the tract with the topographical contour interval of not more than five feet. 
(c)  A site plan for proposed building complexes showing the location of separate buildings and the minimum distance between buildings, and between buildings and property lines, street lines and alley lines. Also to be included on the site plan is a plan showing the arrangement and provision of off-street parking. 
(d)  A landscape plan, prepared in accordance with the provisions of article XXI, landscaping regulations of this appendix. 
(e)  An architectural plan showing elevations to be used throughout the development on commercial buildings. Any or all of the required information may be incorporated on a single drawing if one drawing is clear and can be evaluated by the director of development services and the building official. A legal instrument establishing a plan for permanent care and maintenance of any common area or communally owned facility must be submitted before the development plan will be approved. All such instruments shall be approved by the city attorney as to legal form, and by the city council as to suitability for the proposed use of the common area. 
Section 6. - Coordination with subdivision regulation ordinance. 
1.  Processing under the subdivision ordinance shall be carried out simultaneously with the review of the development plan under this section. 
2.  The development plan submitted under section 5 shall be accompanied by a preliminary plat which meets the requirements of the subdivision ordinance. The preliminary plat shall be reviewed and approved by the planning and zoning commission prior to the granting of any building permits. 
3.  Every planned development district approved under the provisions of this appendix shall be considered as an amendment to the zoning ordinance as applicable to the property involved. In carrying out the development of a planned development district, the development conditions and the development schedule, if required, shall be complied with and such conditions as are specified for the development of a planned development district shall not be construed as conditions precedent to the approval of the zoning amendment, but shall be construed as conditions precedent to the granting of a certificate of occupancy. 
ARTICLE XVI. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT, TOWNHOUSE/CONDOMINIUM 

Section 1. - Purpose of district. 
    Because of the newness of townhouses, condominiums, cluster houses and other such housing concepts in Addison and because such housing does not fall into any existing residential zoning district, the Town of Addison finds that a set of regulations are necessary to set forth the town's policy and attitude towards these housing types. The town does encourage new and creative ideas when such ideas are in the best interest of the town as a whole. Therefore, each application to zone townhouse/condominium must be reviewed individually and judged on its own merits. 
Section 2. - Planned development. 
    In order to provide for individual review, it has been decided that all townhouses, condominiums, cluster housing and other such concepts shall be allowed only under planned development PD zoning. This appendix requires a comprehensive development plan and the development plan "shall become part of the amending ordinance" (see article XV, section 5, of this appendix). Therefore, the following ordinance sets out the town's expectations in regard to these various requirements. 
Section 3. - Comprehensive site plan. 
    This is to be a graphic plan including all of the area under consideration for zoning approval and shall be submitted with the application for such zoning. This plan need not be detailed but must show use areas, land areas for building, principal roadways, parkways, buffers, screening and the number and type of dwelling units. Notes, sketches, photographs and drawings may be attached to the development plan to illustrate the treatment of parkways, parking area, buffer strips, screening, shrubs, roadway design, special subdivision lotting plans and other such ideas which cannot be satisfactorily explained otherwise. Such notes, sketches, photographs and drawings shall be used to evaluate detailed site plans. 
    If the development plan is only conceptual in nature, the zoning may be granted, but no building permit shall be issued until a detail development plan is approved by the city council. 
Section 4. - Detail development plan. 
    A detail development plan shall be approved by the city council prior to the issuance of a building permit and shall show locations of buildings, open spaces, parking areas, drives, streets and other accessways, sidewalks, fire lanes, landscaping, buffer strips, use of buildings, floor plans, number of dwelling units, lotting plans, if applicable, diagrammatic utility layouts and other such things which serve to show that the proposed development will be compatible with the surrounding area and will provide a wholesome environment for future residents. 
    All required screening walls must be of masonry construction. Fences shall be offset from drives or parking so as to avoid damage by vehicles. 
    The detail development plan and the comprehensive site plan may be one-in-the-same if all conditions of both are met. In the event of a multiphase project, it is intended that a detail development plan be submitted only on the area that is proposed for immediate development. Additional plans may be approved as the other phases are ready to be developed. 
Section 5. - General location of zoning. 
    Each application shall be judged on its appropriateness to its site and to its compatibility with existing development to other proposed development. It is felt that through proper planning it is possible to design townhouse/condominium development to fit all areas of Addison. The master plan sets forth the proposed location of single-family areas. These single-family areas are envisioned to possibly be protected from high intensity land uses and traffic volumes along major thoroughfares by medium intensity buffering areas such as garden office and intermediate density housing. 
Section 6. - Permitted uses. 
(A)  Condominium. 
(B)  Townhouses. 
(C)  Community center. 
(D)  Recreation buildings. 
(E)  Laundry rooms.

    Yard requirements: 
(A)  There shall be a 25-foot exterior yard in all cases from public streets.

(C)  There shall be a side yard of 15 feet for two-story buildings. 
(D)  Every part of a required yard or court shall be maintained as open space; provided that ordinary projections may extend into a minimum side yard not more than 24 inches. 
Section 8. - Townhouse yard requirements. 
    Every lot within this district shall have exterior yards of at least 25 feet, a rear yard of at least ten feet and no side yard shall be required. The uniform building code will regulate construction requirements where side property lines intersect with buildings. 
Section 9. - Density. 
    Density within this PD zoning district shall not in any case exceed 18 dwelling units per acre. 
(A)  Maximum lot coverage. No more than 50 percent of the total lot area shall be covered by buildings. 
(B)  Building; lot ratio. There shall be at least 2,400 square feet of lot area for each dwelling unit built on any lot. 
(C)  Minimum dwelling unit size. Every dwelling unit, hereafter erected, shall have a floor area exclusive of breezeways, basements, open and screened porches and garages of not less than 750 square feet. 
Section 10. - Construction materials and design. 
    Condominium developments bring individual behind-the-door owner's side by side in one building with common ownership of other elements of the structure. Therefore, the architectural design and the exterior maintenance are more important in these developments than in detached single-family houses. For this reason, the town feels that much care must be used in the selection of building materials to reduce long range maintenance problems and protect property values. 
(A)  The exterior walls shall be 80 percent masonry. 
(B)  A fire retardant class C roof covering, meeting uniform building code standard 32-7, will be required on all condominium and townhouse units. 
(C)  Balconies visible from public R.O.W. must be recessed and screened or covered and screened. 
(D)  Open guard rails and stair railings shall have intermediate rails or an ornamental pattern such that a sphere six inches in diameter cannot pass between rails. 
Section 11. - Parking. 
(A)  Two parking spaces shall be provided for each dwelling unit. 
(B)  Additional off-street parking, as determined by the council, shall be provided adjacent to all recreational areas. 
(C)  Fire lanes, as required by the fire code, shall be provided and clearly marked. 
(D)  Security lighting must be provided to illuminate parking and public areas; placed so as to reflect the lighting away from adjacent dwelling units. 
Section 12. - Streets, alleys and accessways. 
(A)  All areas for locating dwelling units shall be platted property and located on dedicated streets; however, private streets may be provided if a homeowner association or other agency has control and maintenance of such private streets. Private streets and alleys must be shown on the subdivision plat. 
(B)  Paving standards. Private streets shall meet Town of Addison widths and paving standards. 
(C)  Alley access. Alleys within or abutting a district may be used for ingress or egress to parking and service areas, provided the alley is paved to a width of 20 feet from a street to the parking or service area. 
Section 13. - Open space. 
    In addition to paved parking and driving areas, at least ten percent of the lot shall be maintained in landscaped open area. All parking areas shall be designed and constructed in a manner to include landscaping. All landscaped areas shall have adequate and inconspicuous irrigation systems. 
Section 14. - Utilities. 
(A)  Each condominium/townhouse unit shall have its own underground electrical service. 
(B)  All dwelling units must have washer and dryer connections. 
Section 15. - Postal service. 
    Individual mail provision shall be provided for each unit and shall be located in accordance with guidelines established by the postal service. 
Section 16. - Refuse collection and storage. 
    Individual curbside refuse collection may be required for each unit in a collection unit approved by the council. 
Section 17. - Deed restrictions and owner association agreements. 
    Agreements shall be approved by the Town of Addison and recorded in the county clerk's office, prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
Section 18. - Fire walls separating dwelling units. 
1.  The common walls and ceiling of each unit must be constructed of materials of one-hour construction. 
2.  The attic space must be fire stopped as required by the Uniform Building Code. 
ARTICLE XVII. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT, CONDOMINIUM CONVERSIONS 

Section 1. - Purpose of district. 
    The Town of Addison finds that a different set of regulations are necessary when an apartment complex owner desires to convert the apartments into individually owned dwelling units, with other elements of the complex being common property, shared by all dwelling unit owners. The town will require definite objectives and policies on condominium conversions. 
Section 2. - Planned development. 
    In order to provide for individual review, it has been decided that all condominiums, be allowed only under planned development townhouse condominium PD zoning. This appendix requires a comprehensive development plan and this "shall become part of the amending ordinance" (see article XV, section 5, of this appendix). Therefore, this article sets out the council's expectations in regard to these various requirements. 
Section 3. - Comprehensive site plan. 
    This is to be a graphic plan including all of the area under consideration for zoning approval and shall be submitted with the application for such zoning. This plan must show use areas, principal roadways, parkways, buffers, screening, landscaped areas and the number and type of dwelling units and other such ideas which cannot be satisfactorily explained otherwise. Such notes, sketches, photographs and drawings shall be used to evaluate detailed site plans. 
Section 4. - Detailed conversion site plan.

K.  Fee for acquisition of active recreation space. Every development in a MXR district shall pay a fee to be earmarked for the acquisition or development of active recreation space within the district. The amount of the fee shall be based upon the estimated costs of acquiring land for active recreation space within the district. The amount of the fee per person shall be determined by dividing the estimated costs of land acquisition by the number of persons estimated to reside within the district, for land uses authorized in the comprehensive plan. The plan for acquisition and the schedule of fees shall be established by resolution of the city council, which may be amended from time to time. 
L.  Dedication of land in lieu of fee payment. In lieu of payment of a fee for active recreation space, the owner of a development within the MXR district may request the town to dedicate land in lieu thereof. Dedication shall be based on a standard of four acres of active recreation space per 1,000 residents of the district. The town shall not accept dedication unless the land is a part of the linear greenbelt or is centrally located within the district and is of sufficient amount to meet the need for active recreation space by residents of the district. If the reasonable value of land dedicated is less than the applicable fee, such value shall be credited against the amount of the fee due. The value of dedicated land shall be that assumed for computation of land acquisition costs in calculating the land acquisition component of the fee. 
M.  Conditions applicable to payment of fee. 
(1)  Time and method of fee determination. The applicable fee or land dedication shall be imposed by the town at the time of preliminary plat approval for developments consisting entirely of single-family dwellings, or at the time of approval of the development plan for all other developments. The amount of the fee due shall be computed by multiplying the fee per dwelling unit by the number of dwelling units in the development, reduced by any credits for land dedication. The fee per dwelling unit shall be determined by reference to a table correlating the number of persons with types of dwelling units. 
(2)  Time of collection and form of payment of fee. The fee shall be collected at the time of final plat approval for developments consisting of single-family dwellings and at the time of building permit approval for all other developments. The required fee shall be paid in cash or by cashier's check or other instrument as may be approved by the city attorney. Payment shall be made to the town clerk, who shall provide a receipt therefor. Prior to accepting payment, the town clerk shall verify the amount due by referring to the condition of such payment imposed on the final development plan. 
(3)  Restrictions on use of fees collected. All active recreation space fee payments received pursuant to this section shall be used solely and exclusively for the acquisition of land for active recreation space within the MXR district within which the development is located. 
(4)  Time limit on expenditure of fees. Fees collected shall be expended for active recreation space as provided in this section within a reasonable period of time of collection, but in no event later than five years from the date of collection of such fees. 
(5)  Placement of fees in trust fund. Fees received pursuant to this provision shall be deposited in a segregated interest-bearing fund to be known as the MXR district active recreation space trust fund. The use of such fees shall be restricted to financing active recreation space directly, as herein provided, or for reimbursement to the town for the advancement and/or expenditure of funds for the provision of such active recreation space. 
The town may, in its sole discretion, (a) supplement fees collected pursuant to this provision; (b) advance funds to the trust fund to enable early development of active recreation space; or (c) expend funds for active recreation space and obtain reimbursement from fees collected in the trust fund. 
(6)  Maintenance of financial records. The city manager shall keep and maintain adequate financial records for the trust fund which shall: show the source of disbursement of all fees; account for all fees received; and ensure that the disbursement of fees from such trust fund shall be used exclusively for the purposes set forth herein. 
(7)  Interest on trust fund account. Interest earned by the trust fund shall be credited to the fund account and shall be utilized solely for and limited to the purposes specified for fees of the trust fund. 
(8)  Refunds. A developer may apply for a refund of an in-lieu fee paid pursuant to this provision if the town has failed to provide active recreation space pursuant to this article within five years of the date of collection of such fee. 
N.  Conditions applicable to dedication of active recreation space land. 
(1)  Development plan. Land proposed to be dedicated as active recreation space shall be clearly shown on the preliminary plat or development plan and shall be marked accordingly. 
(2)  Determination of suitability. The town shall, during the preliminary plat or development plan review process, determine whether the land proposed to be dedicated for active recreation space is of a size, location, dimension, topography, and general character, as appropriate for active recreation space use and whether such site is in conformance with the town's comprehensive plan. Except for greenbelt, the land must have a minimum dimension of at least 200 feet. Dedication requirements may be satisfied in part on land located in a planned development district abutting the MXR district, if such land is functionally tied to open space within the district. 
(3)  Imposition of conditions. In its approval of a preliminary plat or development plan which proposes active recreation space land dedication, the town shall impose such conditions as deemed necessary to assure that the intent and proposes of this section are satisfied. 
(4)  Submittal to governing body. Land to be dedicated for active recreation space on the preliminary plat or development plan shall be approved initially by the planning and zoning commission and thereafter shall be submitted to the city council for acceptance of the proposed dedication. No dedication shall be deemed approved without express action of the city council in the form of a written acceptance of dedication. Failure of the city council to execute an acceptance of dedication shall be deemed to be a refusal of the proposed dedication. 
(5)  Effect of failure by governing body to accept dedication. If the city council refuses to accept the dedication, the final development plan shall be returned to the developer for resubmission with (i) appropriate changes to indicate the use of the portion of the property originally proposed to be dedicated for active recreation space; and/or (ii) payment of the applicable in-lieu fee.

Section 1. - Purpose of district. 
    The purpose of the urban center (UC) district is to encourage the mixing of residential, retail, office, and civic uses within an urban framework which is small in scale and compatible with adjacent developments. The intensity and design of development within the district is intended to create an environment that is compatible with major civic events which may be convened within or adjacent to the district. The UC district is to be applied within a special planning area identified in the town's comprehensive plan as the urban center and special events district in order to implement plan objectives and policies therein. The district also is intended to promote flexibility in the development process. It is the intent of this district that development approval shall occur in stages, necessitating approval of a concept plan for the overall development project, a development plan for each phase of such development, and a final development plan for each building site or tract.

Section 6. - Flexible standards. 
A.  Intent. In order to encourage an integrated development pattern of mixed uses over time within the district, it is understood that flexibility in the development of phases or sites may be necessary. Whenever an applicant for establishment of a UC district proposes to authorize alternative uses or phases of the development project, such alternative uses or phases shall be incorporated in such application and depicted on the concept plan for the project. No alternative use shall be designated or approved, however, for sites needed to satisfy minimum residential use standards for the residential subdistrict. Upon approval of the application for zoning amendment and accompanying concept plan by the city council, the alternative uses or phases shall thereafter be considered authorized, subject to such conditions as may be attached and set forth in the adopting ordinance, and a development plan may be submitted for any authorized alternative. 
B.  Flexible standards. It is intended that the dimensional and design standards set forth in sections 3 and 5 of this article be flexible in order to encourage development in the UC district. In some cases, sections 3 and 5 sets forth limits within which specific standards may be varied. In other cases, the developer must request a waiver from a specific standard pursuant to section 9 of this article. The council may approve such waiver in conjunction with its decision to establish or amend the district on the zoning map, where the waiver addresses a standard applicable to the concept plan, or in conjunction with its decision to approve or amend approval of a development plan, where the waiver addresses a standard applicable to the development plan. In no case, however, may the council approve a waiver which authorizes a use not authorized in the UC district, or which increases the allowable intensity or density of any land use.

Section 10. - Conditional use procedure. 
A.  Purpose and applicability. 
1.  Generally. A conditional use is a land use which because of its nature is compatible with the permitted land uses in the urban center district, only upon a determination that the external effects of the use in relation to the existing and planned uses of adjoining property, the neighborhood and public areas can be mitigated through imposition of standards and conditions. This section sets forth the standards used to evaluate proposed conditional uses and the procedures for approving conditional use permit applications. 
2.  Permit required. No building permit shall be issued for any use designated as a conditional use within the UC district unless a conditional use permit has first been approved in accordance with the standards and procedures of this section. 
B.  Standards. The planning and zoning commission in making its recommendation, and the city council in rendering its decision on an application for a conditional use permit, shall evaluate the impact of the proposed use on, and the compatibility of the use with surrounding properties, neighborhoods and public areas to ensure the appropriateness of the use at the proposed location. The planning and zoning commission, and the city council, shall specifically consider the extent to which: 
1.  The proposed use at the specified location is consistent with the future land use policies and map in the town's adopted comprehensive plan; 
2.  The proposed use is consistent with the general purpose and intent of the UC zoning district regulations as applied to the site and, in particular, is consistent with the concept plan and/or development plan approved for the site, together with any conditions attached thereto; 
3.  The proposed use is not materially detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience and welfare, or results in material damage, or prejudice, to other property in the vicinity; and 
4.  The proposed use is compatible with, and preserves the character and integrity of adjacent properties and neighborhoods, and includes improvements or modifications that mitigate development related adverse impacts, including but not limited to: 
(a)  Adequate ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to vehicular and pedestrian safety and convenience, and access in case of fire; 
(b)  Off-street parking and loading areas where required; 
(c)  Paving of streets, alleys and sidewalks; 
(d)  Provisions for drainage; 
(e)  Utilities with reference to location, availability, and compatibility; 
(f)  Screening and buffering features to minimize visual impacts, and/or setbacks from adjacent uses; 
(g)  Control of signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district; 
(h)  Required yards and open space; 
(i)  Height and bulk of structures; 
(j)  Hours of operation; and 
(k)  Roadway adjustments, traffic control devices or mechanisms, and access restrictions to control traffic flow, or divert traffic as may be needed, to reduce, or eliminate, development generated traffic. 
C.  Conditions. In approving a conditional use permit, the planning and zoning commission may recommend, and the city council shall impose, such conditions as are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with these standards and the purpose and intent of this section. Any conditions imposed shall be set forth in writing by the city council. The town shall maintain a record of such approved conditional uses and conditions attached thereto. 
D.  Approval procedures. 
1.  Planning commission recommendation. The planning and zoning commission shall schedule and conduct a public hearing in order to formulate its recommendations to the city council on the conditional use permit application. Following the public hearing, the commission shall recommend approval, modification, or denial, of the proposal to the city council. If the appropriateness of the use cannot be assured at the location, the commission shall recommend denial of the application as being incompatible with existing uses, or uses permitted by right in the district. 
2.  City council action. Following a public hearing and in consideration of the commission's recommendations, the city council shall approve, modify or deny the proposal for a conditional use permit. If the appropriateness of the use cannot be assured at the location, the application for conditional use permit shall be denied as being incompatible with existing uses or uses permitted by right in the district. 
E.  Amendment of conditional use permit. 
1.  Modification. No proposed or existing building, premise, or land use authorized as a conditional use may be established, enlarged, modified, structurally altered, or otherwise changed from that approved in the conditional use permit, unless such amendment is authorized in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in this section for initial approval of the permit. 
2.  Limitation on board of adjustment. The board of adjustment shall have no jurisdiction to hear, review, reverse, or modify any decision, determination, or ruling with respect to an application for a conditional use permit. 
F.  Lapse and extension. 
1.  Lapse of permit. If no building permit has been issued within one year of date of approval of the conditional use permit, such permit shall lapse and no construction shall be permitted, nor use be established, until a new application for conditional use permit is submitted and approved for the intended use. 
2.  Extension. If the applicant requests an extension of the conditional use permit in writing at least 60 days prior to the date of lapse to the city council, the council shall consider such extension request, prior to the expiration date. For good cause shown, the permit may be extended for a period not to exceed one year. 
(Ord. No. 095-019, § 2, 5-3-1995) 
Section 11. - Waiver procedure. 
A.  Procedure. An application for a waiver to a development standard authorized under section 6 of this article must be made by a property owner, lessee, or contract purchaser at the time of submission of an application to establish a UC zoning district, or at the time of submission of a development plan application. A contract purchaser or lessee must file with the application a copy of the contract, or lease, or other form of written statement containing the property owners endorsement of the application. The application shall be filed in duplicate with the planning official on forms provided by the town. Upon a determination that the waiver application is complete, the planning official shall forward the request to the planning and zoning commission, and the city council, for decision in conjunction with its decision on the application to establish a UC zoning district or on the development plan application. 
B.  Standards for granting waiver. The planning and zoning commission in making its recommendations, and the city council in deciding whether to grant the request for waiver, shall determine that the following standards are met: 
1.  The waiver for the specific development site is in harmony with the policies in the town's comprehensive plan. 
2.  The waiver is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this article and the zoning ordinance. 
3.  The waiver shall not adversely affect the use of neighboring property, and the public's use and enjoyment of public areas, in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
4.  The waiver is in conformity with the approved concept plan. 
C.  Conditions. In granting a waiver to a development standard authorized under section 6 of this article, the planning and zoning commission may recommend, and the city council may impose such conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary to insure harmony with the general purpose and intent of this article. Any such condition shall be satisfied as a condition precedent to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development to which the waiver applies. 
D.  Lapse of waiver. A waiver granted under this section shall lapse with the lapse of the development plan, or amendment to the UC district, in accordance with section 13 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 095-019, § 2, 5-3-1995) 
Section 12. - Amendments of plan. 
A.  General requirement. Amendments of any concept plan or development plan, other than minor amendments, shall be made in accordance with the procedure required for approval of the initial plan. Amendments to a concept plan shall be considered amendments to the UC zoning district. 
B.  Minor amendments. Minor amendments to a final development plan may be authorized by the zoning administrator. Minor amendments are those changes of detail which do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property; which do not alter the uses permitted, or increase residential density by more than five percent; which do not change the minimum number of units necessary to satisfy minimum residential standards for the residential subdistrict; which do not decrease off-street parking ratios, or open space requirements; which do not significantly alter the architecture, or landscape, as indicated by the approved development plan; and which do not alter special conditions attached by the planning and zoning commission, or city council, to the approved concept plan or development plan. Any applicant may appeal the decision of the zoning administrator to the commission for review, and decision, as to whether an amendment to the development plan shall be required. 
C.  Alternatives and flexible standards. Amendment of a concept plan is not required prior to submission of a development plan, where alternative uses, or phases, or other variations from standards have been approved in conjunction with establishment of the UC district, and the development plan is consistent with such alternatives or waivers, and any conditions attached thereto. 
D.  Time for amendment. An amendment to an approved concept plan or development plan must be made prior to the time for lapse of approval. In the event an amended plan is approved, the official or agency amending the plan shall specify the time for lapse of such approval, consistent with section 10 hereof. 
(Ord. No. 095-019, § 2, 5-3-1995) 
Section 13. - Lapse of approvals. 
A.  Failure to submit development plan. The preliminary, or final, development plan for the entire first phase shall be submitted for approval within two years from establishment of the UC district, unless otherwise provided by ordinance, or by agreement. If a development plan for all, or a portion, of the project is not submitted within such period, and thereafter approved, the authority to submit such development plan shall lapse, and the city manager, or the planning and zoning commission may institute proceedings to determine whether the land should be rezoned in accordance with procedures set forth in article XXIX. If the project is to be developed in phases, or subphases, all final development plans for subphases shall be submitted within the time frame provided for that phase by the concept plan. 
B.  Failure to submit subsequent development plan. If the project is to be developed in phases, or subphases, subsequent development plans for all subphases of the next phase shall be submitted within three years from issuance of a final certificate of occupancy for the preceding phase unless a different time has been fixed by the council, during its review of the concept plan, as a condition of zoning approval. If subsequent development plans are not submitted within such period, and thereafter approved, authorization to submit such subsequent development plans shall lapse, and the city manager, or the planning and zoning commission, may institute proceedings in order to determine what actions should be taken with respect to the UC district. The planning and zoning commission shall deliver its report to the city council, who shall conduct a public hearing on such recommendation, and shall determine what action is to be taken with respect to the UC district, and the developer's authorization to submit other development plans. 
C.  Failure to submit final development plan. A final development plan shall be submitted for approval within two years from approval of the applicable preliminary development plan, unless a shorter time has been fixed by the council as a condition of preliminary development plan approval. If a final development plan is not submitted within such period, the preliminary development plan and authorization to submit such final development plan shall lapse, and the city manager, or the planning and zoning commission, may institute proceedings to determine whether the preliminary development plan should be reinstated, and what actions should be taken with respect to the UC district, in accordance with the procedures in subsections A and B. 
D.  Lapse of final development plan. If a building permit has not been obtained within two years following approval of the final development plan for a use authorized therein, such plan shall lapse unless the property owner requests an extension prior to the expiration of the two-year period. The request for extension shall be considered by the commission in the same manner as for approval of the final development plan. The commission, or the city council, may initiate review of the development in order to determine whether significant progress is being made. In the event that the council determines that significant progress is not being made, following notice and a public hearing, the council may terminate the final development plan or may attach additional conditions to the extension of the plan. 
E.  Reauthorization to submit development plan. If authority to submit a development plan lapses pursuant to this section 13, the city council may, by resolution, reauthorize submittal of a development plan that is consistent with the concept plan, subject to such conditions as may be appropriate.

ARTICLE XIX.A - BELT LINE DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Sec. I. - Purpose, goals and intent. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the Belt Line District is to implement the adopted recommendations of the comprehensive plan by encouraging new development and redevelopment in the Belt Line Corridor. 
The goals of this zoning district are: 
1.  To capitalize on the convergence of regional transit, freeways and arterial roadways to create major urban and village centers in the Dallas/Fort Worth region that offer a variety of housing, retail and office uses not commonly present in other areas of the Metroplex. 
2.  To provide development and land use flexibility within the framework of a form-based development zoning district. 
3.  To provide a mix of residential, retail and office uses in a pedestrian-friendly environment. 
The intent of this zoning district is: 
1.  To provide a comfortable and attractive environment for pedestrians which includes such things as buildings framing public space, street trees, lighting and awnings that will attract pedestrians. 
2.  To construct buildings close to the sidewalk and street. 
3.  To construct continuous building frontage along block faces except where it is desirable to provide for pedestrian and auto pass-throughs to parking at mid-block. 
4.  To provide shared parking both on-street and in the center of blocks that will benefit the entire district. 
5.  To contribute to the definition and use of public parks and plazas. 
6.  To design and build nonresidential buildings to accommodate a range of uses over time without the need to destroy older buildings and rebuild them for each successive use. 
7.  To design streets and buildings that will contribute to creating a safe environment. 
8.  To encourage redevelopment on a block-by-block basis. 
B.  Implementation. All development within the Belt Line District shall conform to the regulating plan described in section III and set forth in the town's adopted comprehensive plan. The provisions of the Belt Line District shall be applied through zoning map amendments that incorporate a concept plan that is consistent with the regulating plan. Such map amendments may be initiated by the property owner or by the city. Upon the effective date of such map amendments, all regulations within the Belt Line Zoning District shall take effect. Thereafter, lawful existing uses and structures that do not comply with the regulations of the Belt Line District shall be deemed lawful nonconforming uses or structures and may be continued in effect in accordance with and subject to the standards in article XXIII of the zoning ordinance. 
C.  Illustrations. Drawings and diagrams accompanying the text of this ordinance [article] are for reference and illustrative purposes only. Where there may be any conflict with the text or appendices, the text and appendices shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 006-024, 6-13-06) 
Sec. II. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall apply within the Belt Line District. 
    Belt Line District Engineering and Landscape Standards (District Standards). The approved town standards which govern such items as street, streetscape, drainage, signage and other public improvements in the Belt Line District. 
    Building facade, primary. Any facade that faces a public street or open space. 
    City manager. The city manager of the Town of Addison or his designee. 
    Entry, primary. The main entry to a building on a block face. There must be at least one main building entry for each ground floor use, tenant or lobby on each block face which contains the use or tenant. Any additional building entries may be considered a secondary entry. 
    Landmark buildings. Buildings which are located on axis with a terminating street or at the intersection of streets. Such buildings shall incorporate architectural features which address height and articulation that emphasize the importance of such a location. 
    Parking, shared. Parking which is shared by tenants, visitors and the general public. Hours of availability may be further defined in cooperation with the town. 
    Retail use. For the purposes of the Belt Line District, retail use is defined as a business having as its primary function, the supply of merchandise or wares to the end consumer. Such sales constitute the "primary function of the business when sales equal at least 80 percent of the gross sales of the business. 
    Stoop. A structure that is located approximately at the level of the first floor of the structure and intended to provide access to a residential unit. 
    Story. That portion of a building, other than a basement, included between the surface of any floor and the surface of the floor next above it, or if there is no floor above it, then the space between the floor and the ceiling above the floor of such story. This includes any mezzanine or loft which may comprise only a portion of a full floor plate. 
    Waiver to design standards, major (major waiver). A significant change to the standards of this zoning district, as identified in the district regulations and requiring planning and zoning commission and city council approval. (See subsections III.C and VIII.D regarding waivers of design standards.) 
    Waiver to design standards, minor (minor waiver). A minor change to the standards of this zoning district that is not contrary to the stated goals and intent of the district. (See subsections III.C and VIII.D regarding waivers of design standards.) 
(Ord. No. 006-024, 6-13-06) 
Sec. III. - General district standards. 
A.  Regulating plan. 
1.  The regulating plan is a conceptual layout of the following elements of the Belt Line Corridor policies in the town's comprehensive plan: 
a.  Major street types within the district; 
b.  Boundaries of the sub-districts defined in subsection B; 
c.  The location of sites for required at-grade retail uses; 
d.  Public open space and plazas; 
e.  Regional hike and bike corridors; and 
f.  Transit stops. 
2.  Every zoning map amendment that establishes the Belt Line District shall be consistent with the regulating plan. Consistency shall be demonstrated by a concept plan that is incorporated as part of the zoning map amendment. 
B.  Sub-districts created. The Belt Line District shall be divided into the following four sub-districts, the boundaries of which shall be established by the regulating plan for the district. 
1.  Addison Les Lacs Village. Addison Les Lacs Village is intended to be a mixed use retail, residential and office district. Residential uses in this sub-district should be able to capitalize on neighborhood amenities such as the adjacent Addison Athletic Club and the Les Lacs Jogging Trail. An extension of the Les Lacs jogging trail should help tie the residential opportunities north of Belt Line to the neighborhood on the south side of Belt Line. 
2.  Addison Dining District. Addison Dining District is intended to be a vibrant mixed-use retail, restaurant and residential district. This area should be expanded southward to incorporate under-utilized properties down to just south of the east-west section of beltway. This can be accomplished through the creation of smaller blocks which would put in place a more convenient and efficient circulation for pedestrians and automobiles. Residential will be limited to the area west of the north-south section of beltway due to the noise contours from Addison Airport which cross Belt Line to the east. 
3.  Addison Epicurean District. Addison Epicurean District is intended to be a center for sales, education and distribution of wine and other beverages, but it should also be a center for fine meats, seafood, fruits, vegetables, fresh breads, cheeses and flowers. It should be developed with the feel of a European market or shopping district, where bakers, gourmet shops, and fine food purveyors are located adjacent to the existing liquor stores. 
4.  Addison Village. Addison Village is intended to be a mixed use residential and civic area that focuses on the village on the parkway retail center and town hall. It should become a highly pedestrian-oriented area which connects retail across Montfort and ties into existing and future residential development. 

C.  Waivers of design standards. The following waivers are authorized within the Belt Line District, subject to the procedures in subsection VIII.B. 
Minor waivers include: 
Depth or height of required retail space 
Requirement to line a parking garage with buildings 
Requirement for continuous building frontage 
Establishment of build-to line 
Encroachment into the build-to line 
Residential landscape requirement 
Increased building height for "landmark" buildings 
Design of buildings without tri-partite architecture 
Required frequency of building entries along a street edge 
Window detailing 
Exterior building materials 
Exterior building color 
Retail at grade design standards 
Balcony and patio railing 
Landscape standards 
Location of bicycle parking 
Major waivers include: 
Block face length 
Required retail construction 
Building height for non-landmark buildings 
Exceeding the maximum leasable retail area 
Residential at grade design standards 
Required setback of the 4th floor and above 
Parking requirements 
Parking garage design standards 
D.  Land uses. 
1.  Retail, personal service, residential and office uses shall be allowed throughout the district by sub-district, in accordance with the list of authorized uses set forth in appendix I, Belt Line District land use attached. Uses which are not specifically authorized are prohibited. 
2.  Where "required retail use" is designated on the regulating plan, the ground floor adjacent to the street shall be constructed to retail building standards for a depth of at least 50 feet, however a smaller depth may be allowed if the retail is serving as a "liner" use which is masking a parking garage by minor waiver. 
3.  No residential uses shall be permitted within the approved FAA Noise Contours as established in the Addison Airport 14 CFR Part 150 Noise Compatibility Study, May 2005. 
4.  All access drives shall require a minor waiver. 
E.  Block face. It is intended that building walls should be continuous along block faces to create a strong edge to the street and contribute to creating an attractive and active pedestrian environment, with allowance for some limited variation and opportunities for outside dining, pocket parks and special building entry features. 
1.  Block length. The length of a block shall not be less than 200 feet, nor more than 600 feet. Greater or lesser block length shall require approval of a major waiver. 
2.  Block faces shall contain continuous building frontage with the exception of a mid-block access to parking which is no greater than 34 feet in width and 16 feet in height. Any development which does not provide continuous frontage shall require approval of a minor waiver. 

"Continuous building frontage" will be considered to be met if 80 percent or more of the primary building facade is located within 15 feet of the build-to line requirement. However, administrative approval of a Minor Waiver will permit down to 70 percent, provided that the reduction results in an attractive outdoor dining area, building entry feature or other amenity which contributes to the streetscape. A greater reduction shall require approval of a major waiver. 
3.  Facades shall generally be built parallel to the street frontage, except at street intersections, where a facade containing a primary building entrance may be curved or angled toward an intersection. 
4.  Build-to lines (setbacks). 

a.  Build-to lines shall be measured from the planned street back-of-curb, as established on the approved Regulating Plan for the district and the standards in this ordinance [article] (see Table 1 Sub-District Standards). The entire area between the back-of-curb and the primary building facade shall be dedicated as public right-of-way or have a public easement placed upon it. 
b.  Exterior steps, stoops, chimneys, and bay windows may encroach into the setback by two feet. Balconies that are 10 feet or more above the sidewalk may encroach up to 6 feet. 
c.  Awnings may encroach above the public sidewalk without limit, but may not extend into a vehicular roadway or access way. 
F.  Streets. All streets and blocks in the Belt Line District shall conform to the provisions of this section. 
1.  Street standards. Standards for streets within the district shall be as set forth in appendix II, street types. 
2.  Street pattern. The pattern of all streets in the district shall be in conformity with the master thoroughfare plan for the town. The location of streets on the master thoroughfare plan is approximate. Precise location of streets shall be determined in conjunction with approval of the concept and development plans. Street patterns shall be based upon a small scale grid system of interconnecting streets. 


G.  Streetscape and landscape.

Sec. IV. - Buildings. 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this zoning district to create an attractive and active urban style district and the size, disposition, function and design of buildings play an important role in achieving that goal. 

1.  Buildings should directly contribute to the attractiveness, safety and function of the street and public areas. 
2.  Buildings that accommodate retail at grade should feature the retail activity over the building's architecture. 
3.  Buildings should be constructed in a manner, and with materials, that are highly durable and will continue to endure and be attractive over a long time, especially adjacent to public and pedestrian areas. 
4.  It is intended by this zoning district to encourage a variety of building and design solutions in response to the standards and regulations outlined herein. 
B.  Building standards. 
1.  Building form. 
a.  All buildings shall be designed and constructed in tri-partite architecture so that they have a distinct base, middle and top; and all windows shall have a vertical proportion. 


b.  Buildings which are located on axis with a terminating street or at the intersection of streets shall be considered a landmark building. Such buildings shall be designed with landmark features which take advantage of that location, such as an accentuated entry and a unique building articulation which is off-set from the front wall planes and goes above the main building eave or parapet line. 
2.  Architectural features. 

a.  Except where adjacent to Belt Line or Arapaho, buildings which are greater than three stories in height must be set back at the fourth floor and above at least eight feet behind the building face of the first three floors along street frontages. Any change to this standard shall be considered a major waiver. 
b.  Windows, except for retail at grade, shall be vertical in proportion and have at least a four-inch reveal. 
c.  No glass curtain wall shall be permitted except by approval of minor waiver. 
d.  Each building and separate lease space at grade along the street edge shall have a functioning primary entry from the sidewalk. Such entries must be inset from the front building plane by at least five feet. Secondary Entries may be set back as little as three feet. Functioning entries must be located no greater than 30 feet apart. Corner entries may count as a primary entry for both intersecting street frontages. 
e.  Architectural elements of the primary building facade may encroach beyond the build-to line by up to two feet, provided that pedestrian flow will not be subsequently impeded, with the approval of a minor waiver. These elements may include stoops, porches, bay windows, eaves, planters and light wells for a below-grade floor. Balconies, canopies and awnings are not limited in their encroachment, provided that they do not substantially interfere with pedestrian movement and street tree growth. 
3.  External facade materials. The following shall apply to all exterior walls of buildings and parking structures which are clearly visible from a public street, walkway or open space: 
a.  Ground floor exterior walls, excluding windows, doors, and other openings, shall be constructed of 80 percent brick, stone or cultured stone on the exterior facade except in the Epicurean sub-district which may include architectural metals such as stainless steel and galvanized steel. 
b.  The remainder may be constructed of noncombustible materials including exterior stucco and Class PB Exterior Insulating and Finishing Systems (EIFS). Stucco and EIFS shall be used only for walls, architectural features, and embellishments not subject to pedestrian contact. On wholly residential structures, cementitious fiberboard may be used for up to ten percent of the facade provided it is above the ground floor. 
c.  Unpainted metal, or metal subject to ordinary rusting shall not be used as a building material. Factory finished metal elements as well as metals that develop an attractive oxidized finish, such as copper, galvanized metal or weathering steel, may be used as architectural accents by minor waiver approval. 
d.  Windows and glazing shall be limited to a minimum of 30% and maximum of 70 percent of each building elevation. (See 6.b below for special requirements for retail at grade.) 
e.  A variation of up to 15 percent of the standard above, and the material type may be approved by administrative approval of a minor waiver, provided that the change will result in an improved architectural design without degrading the quality of public areas or increasing the need for maintenance. 
4.  Color. 
a.  The dominant color of all buildings (including above grade parking structures) shall be muted shades of color. Black and stark white shall not be used except as an accent color. 
There are no restrictions on accent colors which comprise less than one percent of the building face, except that florescent colors are prohibited. 
b.  Roof colors shall be a muted shade of cool gray, warm gray, brown or red. 
5.  Residential at grade. 
a.  All buildings which have residential unit floor plates within six feet of grade shall include a primary front door entrance into the unit which may be accessed from the sidewalk. Any change to this standard shall be considered a major waiver. 
b.  The entry shall be located a minimum of two feet above the sidewalk elevation and include a minimum 24 s.f. stoop. Any change to this standard shall be considered a major waiver. 
c.  Units must also include windows which provide residents a view of the street and sidewalk area. Any change to this standard shall be considered a major waiver. 
d.  Lobbies to upper stories may be located at grade level. 
e.  Balcony and patio railings and fences shall be constructed of wrought iron or metal. Wood fences and railings and chain-link fencing are prohibited. Masonry columns may be used on patios provided that they are used as accents. 

6.  Nonresidential at grade. 
a.  The ground floor entry must be located at the approximate elevation of the adjacent sidewalk. 
b.  Retail uses adjacent to the sidewalk at grade shall: 
i.  Be constructed to meet fire code separation from any other uses constructed above; 
ii.  Have a minimum clear height of 16 feet between finished floor and the bottom of the structure above. Mezzanines within the retail space shall be allowed per building code; 
iii.  Have an awning or canopy which extends at least six feet over the sidewalk for at least 75 percent of the frontage on any portion of a building. Such awning or canopy shall maintain a minimum 7.5-foot clearance over the sidewalk; and 
iv.  Have highly transparent glass windows for at least 60 percent, but no greater than 80 percent, of the ground floor facade.

(Ord. No. 006-024, 6-13-06) 
Sec. VIII. - Procedures. 
A.  Establishment of district. An application for establishment of a Belt Line District shall be considered an application for a zoning amendment and shall be processed in accordance with article XXIX. The ordinance establishing the Belt Line District shall incorporate the concept plan described in subsection B. The city council may attach such conditions to establishment of the district as are reasonably necessary to assure that the district meets the purpose and intent of this article. 
B.  Concept plan. An application for establishment of a Belt Line District shall be accompanied by a concept plan, which shall be processed simultaneously with the zoning amendment applications. If the zoning amendment is approved, the concept plan shall be incorporated as part of the regulations governing the district. The submittal requirements for the concept plan shall be the same as for those for a concept plan for an urban center district, as provided in article XIX, section 7, and shall incorporate the elements of the regulating plan contained in the comprehensive plan for the sub-district(s) in which the property is located, together with any requirements specific to the Belt Line District, as may be determined from time to time by the city manager. The concept plan, when approved as part of the ordinance creating the Belt Line District, applies the regulating plan to the property for purposes of all future development. 
C.  Development plan approval. 
1.  Following rezoning of property to the Belt Line District and prior to obtaining a building permit, a development plan must be approved by the city manager or his designee, demonstrating that the proposal meets the purpose, intent and standards contained in this zoning district. 
2.  A development plan application must include the following information and documents that demonstrate compliance with the standards of the Belt Line District: 
a.  Detailed site plan showing proposed streets, buildings, parking areas, and landscaped areas. 
b.  Proposed uses. 
c.  Building elevations and sections. 
d.  Proposed parking standards. 
e.  Any waivers being requested. 
3.  An application for a development plan shall be processed in accordance with the city's procedures for determining whether an application is complete. Following a determination of completeness, and unless the application is accompanied by a request for a major waiver, the city manager, or his designee, shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the application for a development plan and shall notify the applicant of his decision. 
4.  Denial or conditional approval of a development plan by the city manager may be initially appealed to the planning and zoning commission and, following the recommendation of the commission, to the town council. The appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the date of the manager's action on the application for a development plan approval. 
5.  If the application includes a request for a major waiver, the manager shall schedule the application for hearing before the planning and zoning commission with his recommendation on the application. The planning and zoning commission, following a public hearing, shall forward its recommendation to the city council for hearing on the application and waiver request. The city council, following a public hearing, shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the application for a development plan and the major waiver request. The notice and hearing procedures for approval of a specific use permit shall be used to process the development plan and major waiver application. 
6.  The city manager in making an initial decision on a development plan application, the planning and zoning commission in making recommendations to the city council, or the city council in deciding the application for development plan approval, shall determine whether the plan is consistent with the concept plan for the property, and meets the standards of the Belt Line District, together with any conditions attached to the ordinance establishing the district. When the development plan is accompanied by a minor waiver request, the city manager or the council on appeal shall apply the standards for approval of minor waiver in subsection D. When a major waiver has been requested with the development plan application, the commission in making its recommendation and the council in deciding the application shall apply the criteria for a major waiver to the development plan application in subsection D. 
D.  Waivers of design standards. 
1.  For the purposes of this district, there shall be two types of waivers of design standards - minor and major. Requests for waivers shall not be subject to review or decision by the zoning board of adjustment. A waiver request may only be made in conjunction with an application for a development plan or, for a request for a major waiver, in conjunction with a request to rezone property to the belt line district. A waiver request may not be used to amend the concept plan for the district. 
2.  Minor waivers are those changes to design standards in the Belt Line District identified in subsection III.C. Minor waivers may be approved administratively by the city manager or his designee in conjunction with a decision on an application for approval of a development plan. All minor waivers must meet the full intent of this zoning district as stated in section I. 
3.  Major waivers are major changes to the design standards in the Belt Line District, including any change not identified in subsection III.C. Major waivers may only be approved by the city council, following a recommendation by the planning and zoning commission, in conjunction with a decision on an application for approval of a development plan. In order to approve a major waiver, the city council must find that the waiver: 
a.  Meets the general intent of this district and the sub-district in which the property is located; and 
b.  Is consistent with the concept plan approved for the property; and 
c.  Will result in an improved project which will be an attractive contribution to the sub-district; and 
d.  Will not prevent the realization of the intent of the sub-district or adjoining sub-districts. 
4.  The town may impose conditions on granting any waiver in order to implement the concept plan for the property or to mitigate negative impacts to neighboring properties or public streets or open space. 
E.  Amendments. 
1.  Amendments to an approved concept plan other than minor amendments shall be considered amendments to the zoning ordinance establishing the district, and shall be processed in accordance with article XXIX. 
2.  Amendments to an approved concept plan shall be considered "minor" if: 
a.  The amendment is consistent with the standards and provisions of this ordinance, or 
b.  The amendment is in conjunction with the specific granting of a minor or major waiver as part of a development plan approval. 
3.  Amendments to an approved development plan may be accomplished in the same manner as approval of the original development plan, and may be accompanied by a request for major or minor waivers. 
4.  An amendment to an approved concept plan or development plan must be made prior to the time for lapse of approval provided in subsection F. In the event an amended plan is approved, the official or agency amending the plan shall specify the time for lapse of such approval, consistent with subsection F. 
F.  Lapse of approval. 
1.  The development plan for the entire first phase of a project shall be submitted for approval within two years from establishment of the Belt Line District, unless otherwise provided by ordinance. If a development plan for all, or a portion, of the project is not submitted within such period, and thereafter approved, the authority to submit such development plan shall lapse, and the city manager, or the planning and zoning commission may institute proceedings to determine whether the land should be rezoned in accordance with procedures set forth in article XXIX. If the project is to be developed in phases, all development plans for phases shall be submitted within the time frame provided for that phase by the concept plan. 
2.  If the project is to be developed in phases, a subsequent development plan for the next phase shall be submitted within three years from issuance of a final certificate of occupancy for the preceding phase, unless a different time has been fixed by the council in the ordinance establishing the Belt Line District. If subsequent development plans are not submitted in accordance with the schedule, and thereafter approved, authorization to submit such subsequent development plans shall lapse, and the city manager, or the planning and zoning commission, may institute proceedings in order to determine what actions should be taken with respect to the Belt Line District. The planning and zoning commission shall deliver its report to the city council, who shall conduct a public hearing on such recommendation, and shall determine what action is to be taken with respect to the Belt Line District, and the developer's authorization to submit other development plans. 
3.  If a building permit has not been obtained within two years following approval of the development, such plan shall lapse unless the property owner requests an extension prior to the expiration of the two-year period. The request for extension shall be considered by the planning and zoning commission or city council in the same manner as for approval of the development plan. The commission or the council may grant an extension of the time for expiration of the development plan for a period not to exceed one year from the date of initial approval of the applications. Every request for extension shall include a statement of the reasons why the expiration date should be extended. The decision-maker may grant a request for extension upon demonstration that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have resulted in the applicant's inability to perform the tasks necessary to prevent the development plan from expiring before the lapse date. The commission or the council also may terminate the development plan or may attach additional conditions to the extension of the plan. 
G.  Special uses. An application for approval of a special use within the Belt Line District shall be processed and decided in accordance with the procedures for a conditional use permit for the urban center district, as set forth in article XIX, subsection 10. If the use is being proposed in conjunction with an application for a development plan, the procedures for approving the development plan shall be the same as for the special use.

ARTICLE XXII. - EXCEPTIONS[10] 

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Cross reference- Businesses, ch. 22. 

Section 1. - Vision clearance. 
(A)  Definition. In this section visibility triangle is that area in a triangle sight area, at all intersections, which shall include that portion of public right-of-way at any corner lot within the adjacent curblines and a diagonal line intersecting such curblines at points 35 feet back from their intersection. 
(B)  Prohibited within visibility triangle. It shall be unlawful to set out, maintain or permit or cause to be set out or maintained any shrub, plant, sign or other view obstruction having a height greater than 21/2 feet as measured from the top of the curb of the adjacent streets within the visibility triangle. This restriction shall not apply to permanent structures authorized by the zoning ordinance or to traffic control signs and signals, street signs or utility poles placed within such area by authority of the city council. 
Section 2. - Front yard. 
    The front yards heretofore required shall be adjusted in the following cases: 
(A)  Where 35 percent or more of the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings that have observed, with variation of five feet or less, a front yard greater or lesser in depth than herein required, new buildings shall not be erected closer to the street than the building line so established by the existing buildings. However, this regulation shall not be interpreted as requiring a building line of more than 35 feet. 
(B)  Where the frontage between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings that have not observed a front yard as described in [subsection] (A) above, then: 
(1)  Where a building is to be erected on a parcel of land and will not be more than 200 feet from existing buildings on either side, the building line shall be a line drawn between the two closest front corners of the adjacent buildings on the two sides. 
(2)  Where a building is to be erected on a parcel of land and will not be more than 200 feet from existing buildings on one side only, such building may be erected as close to the street as the existing adjacent building. However, this regulation shall not be interpreted as requiring a building line of more than 50 feet. 
(C)  Where a building line has been established by ordinance and such line requires a greater setback than is prescribed by this appendix in the district in which the building line is located, no building shall be erected closer to the street than the line so established. 
(D)  Where a building line is shown on a plat recorded for record with the county clerk prior to the passage of this appendix, and such building line provides a front yard of 25 feet or more in depth and a side yard of ten feet or more in depth and is part of a comprehensive plan for the orderly development of a subdivision, either with a uniform or staggered building line, no building shall be erected closer to the street than the building line or lines so shown. However, any building line established by ordinance shall take precedence over a building line shown on a recorded plat. 
(E)  Open and unenclosed terraces or porches and eave and roof extensions may project into the required front yard for a distance not to exceed four feet; provided, however, that no supporting structure for such extensions may be located within the required front yard. The supporting structure for the storage of automobiles shall not be located within the required front yard. An unenclosed canopy for a gasoline filling station or similar business may extend beyond the building line but shall never be closer to the property line than 12 feet. The building line of a gasoline filling station shall mean the actual wall of the filling station and shall not be interpreted as being the curb of a walk or driveway, or as the front of a canopy or the column supporting same. 
Section 3. - Side and rear yards. 
(A)  Every part of the required side or rear yard shall be open and unobstructed except for accessory buildings as permitted herein and the ordinary projection of window sills, belt courses, and other ornamental features projecting not to exceed 12 inches. Eaves and awnings on main residential structures may project to within three feet of a side or rear lot line. 
(B)  Accessory buildings may be built in the rear yard except that, when such accessory building is located closer than 15 feet to the main building, it shall observe the same side yard as required for the main building. 
(C)  Open or lattice enclosed fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways, balconies opening upon fire towers, and ordinary projections of chimneys and flues into rear yards may be permitted by the building inspector into the required rear yard for a distance not to exceed 31/2 feet. 
(D)  Terraces, uncovered porches, platforms and ornamental features which do not extend more than three feet above the ground (first) floor level of the building may project into a required side yard provided such projections not be erected closer than two feet from the side lot lines. 
Section 4. - Lot area.

Section 2. - Use continued until deemed a nuisance. 
    The lawful use of any building, structure, or land existing at the time such property was more restrictively zoned may be continued except as this appendix may require abatement within a given period of time; provided, however, the right to continue such nonconforming uses shall be subject to regulations prohibiting nuisances and shall be terminated when such use constitutes a nuisance. Such nonconforming uses shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as the zoning board of adjustment may require to protect adjacent property and shall be subject to the specific nonconforming use regulations herein contained. 
Section 3. - Accidental damage to building. 
    If a building occupied by nonconforming uses is destroyed by fire or the elements, it may not be reconstructed or rebuilt except to conform with provisions herein. In the case of partial destruction by fire or other causes, not exceeding 50 percent of its current replacement value, the building official shall issue a permit for reconstruction. If greater than 50 percent, the building uses must be made to conform to this appendix. 
Section 4. - Substandard structure. 
    The right to operate and maintain any nonconforming structure shall terminate and shall cease to exist whenever the nonconforming structure becomes substandard under any applicable ordinance of the town and the cost of placing such structure in lawful compliance when the applicable ordinance exceeds 50 percent of the replacement cost of such structure on the date that the building official determines that such structure is substandard.

Section 6. - Repairs and alterations. 
    Repairs and alterations may be made to an undamaged nonconforming building or structure; provided, however, no structural alterations shall be made except those required by law or ordinance, unless the building is changed to a conforming use; and provided that no additional dwelling units shall be added where the nonconforming use results from there being more dwelling units on the lot than is permissible in the district in which the building is located. No enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use shall take place except as the zoning board of adjustment may grant, as a special exception, an application to extend or enlarge a building occupied by such use provided such grant does not serve to prevent the return of such property to a conforming use. 
Section 7. - Continuance of nonconforming use. 
    Except as this appendix may otherwise require, any nonconforming use may be continued in operation on the same land area and on the same floor area in a structure or structures which were occupied by the nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of any amendment by which the use became nonconforming, but such land area or floor area shall not be increased. 
Section 8. - Registration of nonconforming use. 
    No nonconforming use shall be renewed, the owner or tenant changed without a certificate of occupancy authorizing such renewal, change or extension. 
Section 9. - Changing a nonconforming use. 
    Any nonconforming use may be changed to a use conforming with the regulations herein established for the district in which the nonconforming use is located; provided, however, that a nonconforming use so changed shall not thereafter be changed back to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
Section 10. - Abandonment. 
    A nonconforming use of any building or structure which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be returned to any nonconforming use.

A.  Planned development districts. Private streets shall be prohibited except in Planned Development zoning districts ("PD District") approved by the city council. The location of each private street development will be subject to the approval of the city council on a case-by-case basis, based on, among other matters, the criteria described in this section. An applicant who meets the criteria set forth in this Section will not be entitled to private streets within a PD District as a matter of right, but shall only obtain approval for the private streets at the sole discretion of the city council. 
B.  Definitions . For purposes of this section, the following words, except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, shall be defined as follows: 
1.  Applicant means the owner(s) of all of the lots in the proposed subdivision or property owners' association, as the context allows. 
2.  Private street means a platted street providing limited local traffic circulation among adjacent lots which is privately owned and maintained, contained within a private street lot, and constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section and all other applicable ordinances, standards, and regulations. The term "private street" shall be inclusive of private alleys. 
3.  Private street lot means a separate tract, typically termed a common area, owned by the property owners' association whereupon a private street is constructed. 
C.  Qualifying criteria. The area to be considered for private streets: 
1.  May not impede the current or future street circulation needs of the area or other portions of the city, especially, without limitation, any needed collector or arterial street route, or adequate access to any adjoining tract; 
2.  May not disrupt an existing or proposed public pedestrian pathway, hike and bike trail or park; and 
3.  Must have direct access to an undivided collector (C2U) with a minimum 50 foot right-of-way. 
D.  General requirements. 
1.  A private street system must comply with all design, construction, and other standards of the Town of Addison including, without limitation, this Appendix B-Subdivisions of the Code of Ordinances applicable to streets and alleys generally (including the provisions of Section XVI of this Appendix B-Subdivisions). Without limiting the foregoing, all references in this Appendix B-Subdivisions and other applicable regulations to "street," "public street," "right-of-way," "public right-of-way," or "alley" shall apply to a private street system. 
2.  A private street system must provide access for emergency vehicles, public and private utility maintenance and service personnel, the U.S. Postal Service, and government employees in pursuit of their official duties. 
3.  A proposed private street subdivision should not result in an over-concentration of such developments as determined by the city council in its sole discretion. 
4.  A proposed private street subdivision will be evaluated to assess its impact on the efficiency, convenience, and safe function and implementation of the City's Master Thoroughfare Plan. Conflicts with the Master Thoroughfare Plan will require changes to the proposed private street subdivision and may result in the denial or revocation of a PD (planning development) zoning district. 
5.  The city shall not pay for any portion of the cost of constructing, maintaining, repairing, or replacing a private street. 
E.  Specific requirements. Each area being considered for private streets shall comply with the following: 
1.  Each plat containing any private street shall contain the following wording on the face of the plat: "The streets have not been dedicated to the public, for public access, nor have been accepted by the Town of Addison, Texas as public improvements, and the streets shall be maintained by the property owners' or property owners' association within the subdivision, and the streets shall always be open to emergency vehicles, public and private utility maintenance and service personnel, the U.S. Postal Service, and governmental employees in the completion of their official duties." 
Private streets, leading into a private subdivision, may not contain a gate or a controlled access mechanism at the entrance or exit of the private subdivision preventing free flow of traffic. 
2.  All building lines as required by zoning shall, in the case of private streets, be measured from the public utility and storm sewer easement. 
3.  Private streets and alleys shall be located in a "public utility and storm sewer easement." The width of the easement shall be the same as the required right-of-way for a public street, unless specifically approved at a lesser width by the city council upon a recommendation by the city's director of public works. 
4.  Easements. Private street developments shall provide the following easements: 
(a)  "Public utility and storm sewer" easements containing private streets and public utilities. 
(b)  Additional public utility easements required by public agencies. 
(c)  Pre-existing easements unaffected by the platting process. 
(d)  Such private service easements, including but not limited to, utilities, fire lanes, street lighting, government vehicle access, mail collection and delivery access, and utility meter reading access, as may be necessary or convenient. 
5.  Access. Except where substantial existing natural or man-made barriers would render the requirement unreasonable as determined by the city, each such development should have direct access to a two-lane collector street (40-foot pavement width), unless a lesser width two-lane collector is determined adequate by the city due to an absence of the need for on-street parking (but in no case shall the pavement width be less than 24 feet without the express written approval of the city's fire chief), in addition to any access to one or more arterial streets that may be proposed. Any private street development of such limited size that it does not require direct collector street access for appropriate traffic service may instead, as determined by the city, have access to a collector street within the neighborhood by way of another local street. 
6.  Site plan. For each private street development and in connection with the review and consideration of approval thereof, a site plan shall be submitted to the City Council, which shall include the information and materials required for a development plan as set forth in Article XV, Section 5 of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town (contained in Appendix A-Zoning of the Code of Ordinances), as amended or superseded, and shall further include the following: 
(a)  Illustration of fencing, the entryway, and the location of any other items within the private street development, and a rendering of the elevation of any other proposed structures, including a description of proposed building materials, roof pitches, signage, and such other items as the city staff may request (said rendering of elevation of proposed structures does not refer to residential structures, but rather to other structures that are components of the private street development); 
(b)  Illustration of items outside the private street development such as, but not limited to, entrance area, barriers, perimeter walls, exterior landscaping, and other elements as required by city staff; 
(c)  Illustrate the relationship of the development to the qualifying criteria set forth in this section. 
7.  A private street and alley shall include and be subject to all public utility (including, without limitation, water and sanitary sewer) and storm sewer easements in favor of and reserved unto the Town of Addison, the width of which shall be the same as the entire width of the street or alley right-of-way. In addition, a private street or alley shall include and be subject to all additional public utility easements required by any utility company (including, without limitation, any electric, telephone, gas, or cable television companies or providers) or public agency, as well as any easements existing at the time of the creation of the private street or alley. Additionally, there shall be reserved other easements, including but not limited to easements for fire lanes, street lighting, government vehicle access, mail collection and delivery access, and utility meter reading access, as may be necessary or convenient. The easement shall also provide the city with the right of access for any purpose related to the exercise of a governmental service or function, including but not limited to fire and police protection, inspection and code enforcement. The easement shall permit the city to remove any vehicle or obstacle within the street lot that impairs emergency access. Private streets and alleys may be required to have fire lane markings as determined by the city's fire marshal. For purposes hereof, "fire marshal" means the fire chief or the fire chief's designee. 
8.  In connection with the approval of a subdivision with private streets or alleys, the applicant shall provide, in form and content acceptable to the city, an agreement to be recorded in the appropriate records of Dallas County, whereby the applicant or the property owners' association, as the case may be, as the owner of the private streets and alleys, agrees to release, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Town of Addison, its officials, officers, employees, and agents, and any other governmental entity and public utility, and their respective officials, officers, employees or agents, for any damage to the private street or alley occasioned by the use thereof by the city, governmental entity or public utility (or their respective officials, officers, employees, and agents), and for damages and injury (including death) arising from the condition of said private street or alley; and for damages and injury (including death) arising out of any use of the subdivision by the city, government entity or public utility (or their respective officials, officers, employees, and agents). Further, such language shall provide that all lot owners shall release and forever discharge the town, governmental entities and public utilities (and their respective officials, officers, employees, and agents) for such damages and injuries. The indemnifications contained in this subsection apply regardless of whether or not such damages and injury (including death) are caused by the negligent act or omission of the city, governmental entity or public utility, or their respective officials, officers, employees or agents. 
F.  Property owners' association. 
1.  Property owners' association required. Subdivisions with private streets shall have a property owners' association. 
(a)  The property owners' association shall own and be responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of private streets, alleys, and appurtenances, which shall be maintained, repaired, and replaced in accordance with the ordinances, codes, standards, rules, and regulations of the city for public streets, alleys, and appurtenances. 
(b)  The Town of Addison has no obligation to inspect, maintain, repair, or replace a private street or alley, but repair, maintenance, and replacement plans shall, prior to repair, maintenance or replacement work being performed, be submitted to the town for review, and the approval of the same, if given by the town, shall not constitute nor be deemed a release of the responsibility and liability of the property owners' association or any of the owners of property within the subdivision or area, nor of the engineer or other design professional that prepared or approved the same, and their employees, contractors, subcontractors, agents and engineers for the accuracy and competency of such designs, working drawings, specifications or other documents and work, nor shall such approval be deemed to be an assumption of or an indemnification for such responsibility or liability by the town for the designs, working drawings, specifications or other documents or work or for any defect, error or omission therein. 
(c)  Inspection fees will apply to all repair, maintenance, and replacement work. 
(d)  The property owners' association shall provide for the payment of dues and assessments required to maintain, repair, and replace the private streets and alleys. Lot deeds must convey membership in the property owners' association and provide for and require the payment of dues and assessments required by the property owners' association. The property owners' association documents must be acceptable to the city council, after review by city staff, and after the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, at the time of final plat approval. The approved documents must be filed for record contemporaneously with the filing of the final plat in the appropriate county records. 
2.  Reserve fund. The property owners' association documents must establish a reserve fund for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of private streets and other improvements such as common greenbelts, walls, fences and other barriers, and other significant property owners association infrastructure ("reserve fund"). This reserve fund shall not be commingled with any other property owners' association funds. The balance of the reserve fund shall at all times be equal to the total replacement cost of the private streets and other improvements divided by the average life expectancy of those improvements times the age of the improvements. The life expectancy for a subdivision with concrete streets shall be a minimum of 20 years. 
(a)  The property owners' association shall have an annual review performed by an independent certified public accounting firm verifying the amount in the reserve fund. The replacement cost will be updated each year to current costs. A copy of this review shall be promptly provided to the town upon its completion. 
(b)  If for any reason the private streets are converted to public streets, the reserve fund shall become the property of the town, and the property owners' association documents shall so provide. 
3.  Allowance. The property owners' association's covenants shall contain provisions that allow the Town of Addison, at its sole election, to assume the duty of performing the maintenance, repair, or replacement obligations of the streets, alleys, and appurtenances should the property owners' association dissolve or in any way fail or refuse to maintain its obligations regarding the private streets, alleys, and appurtenances. The covenants shall further provide that the city may use the outstanding balance in the reserve fund for maintenance, repair or replacement or in addition thereto and/or in the alternative, levy an assessment upon each lot on a pro rata basis for the cost of such maintenance, repair, or replacement and to collect the same, whether by foreclosure or otherwise. To this extent, the city shall be made a third party beneficiary of and party to the property owner association's covenants. 
4.  Membership requirements . Every lot owner within the private street development shall be a member of the property owners' association, and every lot shall be subject to covenants and/or restrictions pertaining to the subdivision and to the property owners' association. 
5.  Required disclosures . The property owners' association documents shall address and include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(a)  The property owners' association documents must indicate that the streets, alleys, and appurtenances within the development are private, owned and maintained by the property owners' association, and that the Town of Addison has no obligation or duty to construct, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the private streets, alleys, and appurtenances. 
(b)  The property owners' association documents shall include a statement indicating that the Town of Addison may in its sole discretion, but is not obligated to, inspect private streets and require repairs or replacement necessary to insure that the same are maintained to city standards. 
(c)  The property owners' association documents shall include a statement that the property owners' association may not be dissolved without the prior written consent of the city; nor may the property owners' association stop collection of fees or assessments for the reserve fund without such consent. 
(d)  The section called "mandatory conversion" of this section shall be included in the property owners' association documents, to increase the opportunity for awareness of mandatory conversion of private streets to public streets. 
(e)  Assessment for repairs. Assignment of property owners' association lien rights: The property owners' association declaration shall provide that should the property owners' association fail to carry out its duties as specified in these regulations and as further specified in the property associations documents, the Town of Addison and/or its lawful agents, shall have the right and ability, in their sole discretion, after due notice to the property owners' association, to perform the responsibilities of the property owners' association if the property owners' association fails to do so in compliance with any of the provisions of the regulations set forth in this section (as amended or superseded) or of any applicable city ordinances, codes, regulations, standards, rules, or agreements with the city and to assess the property owners' association and/or the lot owners for all costs incurred by the city in performing said responsibilities if the property owners' association fails to do so, and the city shall further have any and all liens and lien rights granted to the property owners' association to enforce the assessments required by the declaration; and/or to avail itself of any other enforcement actions available to the city pursuant to state or city codes, ordinances, and regulations. The property owners' association documents (declaration) shall further provide that the city may also in such an instance use the outstanding balance in the reserve fund for maintenance, repair or replacement. No portion of the property owners' association documents pertaining to the maintenance, repair, or replacement of the private streets, alleys, and appurtenances may be amended without the written consent of the Town of Addison. 
(f)  Services not provided. The property owners' association documents, all property deeds, and the final plat shall note that certain Town of Addison services shall not be provided on private streets. Among the services which will not be provided include: Routine police patrols, enforcement of traffic and parking ordinances, and preparation of accident reports. All private traffic regulatory signs shall conform to the Texas Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Depending on the characteristics of the proposed development other services may not be provided, as determined by the town. However, any portion of a private street or alley marked as a fire lane shall be subject to enforcement of applicable laws, ordinances, codes, and regulations relating to fire lanes. 
(g)  Access required. The property owners' association documents shall contain a provision that requires access to emergency vehicles, utility personnel, the U.S. Postal Service, and governmental employees in pursuit of their official duties. 
G.  Conversion of private streets to public streets. 
1.  Voluntary conversion . The city may in its sole discretion, but is not obligated to, accept private streets and alleys for public ownership, access and maintenance. The procedure to convert private streets and alleys to public streets and alleys must conform to all of the following provisions and such other standards as the city may determine: 
(a)  The property owners' association must submit a petition signed by at least 75 percent of its members (or a greater number of signatures if required by the property owners' association document). 
(b)  All of the infrastructure to be converted from private to public status must be in a condition that is acceptable to the city, in the city's sole discretion. 
(c)  All monies in the reserve fund must be delivered and paid to the city. 
(d)  The subdivision plat covering the area which is the subject of the conversion must be submitted as a replat, and upon approval shall be re-filed to dedicate the streets, alleys, utility, storm sewer easements, and other appurtenances to the city or other appropriate entity, as determined by the city. 
(e)  The property owners' association documents must be modified and re-filed to remove requirements specific to private street subdivisions. 
2.  Mandatory conversion. The city will notify the property owners' association of violations of the private street regulations, including the standards and provisions set forth in this section. Failure to bring the subdivision into compliance with the regulations may cause the city to revoke, amend, or modify the PD District zoning for the area covered by the private streets and alleys, including, without limitation, an amendment to remove the allowance for private streets and alleys under the PD District zoning. 
If the PD District zoning is so amended, modified, or revoked, the city may correct all remaining violations and unilaterally re-file the subdivision plat thereby dedicating the streets, alleys, and appurtenances to the public. All monies in the reserve fund will become the property of the city and will be used to offset any costs associated with converting the private streets to public streets. In the event the balance is not sufficient to cover all expenses, the property owners' association and/or the property owners will be responsible for the amount of unpaid work, and the city shall have the right, in addition to any other rights it has or may have to collect such amounts from the property owners' association and/or the property owners, to levy an assessment upon each lot on a pro rata basis for the cost of such work and to collect the same, and the city shall further have any and all liens and lien rights granted to the property owners' association to enforce such assessments; and/or to avail itself of any other enforcement actions available to the city pursuant to state or city codes, ordinances, and regulations. Provisions to this effect shall be included in the property owners' association documents, all property deeds, and the final plat. 
H.  Conversion of public streets to private streets. For the streets and alleys of an existing platted subdivision to become private: 
1.  The property owner association for such subdivision must submit to the city a written petition signed by 100 percent of its members and all property owners within the subdivision or area requesting the conversion of public streets and alleys within the subdivision to private streets and alleys (the form for such petition shall be approved by the city secretary); 
2.  An applicant must purchase installed infrastructure and right-of-way from the Town of Addison, and establish a reserve fund in accordance with this section; and 
3.  The applicant must comply with such other requirements or conditions as may be required by the city council in its sole discretion.

Section VIII. - Preliminary plat and plans. 
    The developer shall submit preliminary plat and plans of the subdivision to the development services department. Submittal shall include a letter of transmittal requesting review and the required filing fees. 
    The purpose of the submittal is to allow the planning and zoning commission to review overall platting of the tract, water and sewer service, and street patterns within the subdivision for conformance with the requirements of the town.

Extensions made to such unserved areas shall be complete to all requesting cable service within 12 months from the time construction begins within the area or, in the case of a residential subdivision, within or 100 days after the issuance by the Town of Addison of certificates of occupancy for 50 percent of the units which are to be constructed in the subdivision pursuant to the subdivision plan or plat, whichever period is shorter. In the event a subdivision plan or plat which has been approved by the Town of Addison designates phases of construction or development, grantee shall comply with the terms of this provision for each designated phase. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions within this section, grantee shall provide service upon request to potential subscribers in such areas that do not meet the foregoing provisions where the subscriber is willing to contribute to the cost of the system extension. 
    If more than 125 feet of distance lies between the nearest distribution cable and the point of connection of service to the property for which service is requested, or if there is a density of less than 15 potential subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet, service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the grantee and the subscribers in the area to which cable service may be expanded, the grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction of the other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 15 potential subscribers. Subscribers who request cable service hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance. Said subscribers shall also be responsible for any standard/nonstandards installation charger to extend the cable system from the tap to the potential subscriber. 
    Sec. 30.04. Installation. [The] grantee shall attempt in good faith to install extensions to newly developed areas at the same time as other utilities are installing service to the area. 
Article XXXI. - Valuation. 
    Sec. 31.01. Town's right to purchase cable system. In the event the grantee forfeits or town terminates this franchise pursuant to the provision of this ordinance, or at the normal expiration of the franchise term if the franchise will not be renewed pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, the town shall have the right to purchase the cable system pursuant to section 627 of the cable act. If town should elect to exercise its right to purchase such cable system, payment of a fair valuation, which shall then be the then current fair market value, shall be required. Should the parties fail to agree upon the then current fair market value, the same shall be determined in an appropriate proceeding filed in any court having jurisdiction. 
Article XXXII. - Recourse, understanding, and construction. 
    Sec. 32.01. Requirements and enforcement. Except as expressly provided herein, grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against town of any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of the provisions or requirements of this franchise or because of the enforcement thereof by town or because of the lack of town's authority to grant all or any part of this franchise. 
    Sec. 32.02. Grantee's understanding. [The] grantee expressly acknowledges that in accepting this franchise, it relied solely upon its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of town to grant this franchise and that grantee was not induced to accept this franchise by any understanding, promise, or other statement, verbal or written, by or on behalf of town or by any third person concerning any term or condition not expressed herein. 
    Sec. 32.03. Construction of franchise. By acceptance of this franchise, grantee acknowledges that it has carefully read the provisions hereof and is willing to and does accept all of the risks of the meanings of such provisions and agrees that in the event of any ambiguity herein or in the event of any other dispute over the meaning thereof, the same shall be construed strictly against grantee and in favor of town. 
Article XXXIII. - Acceptance of franchise. 
    Sec. 33.01. Method of acceptance. Within 30 days from the effective date of this Ordinance, grantee shall file with the city secretary a written statement in the following form signed in its name and behalf: 
    "To the Honorable Mayor and City Council of the Town of Addison, Texas: For itself, its successors, and assigns, TCI TKR of the Metroplex, Inc., a Texas corporation duly authorized to do business in the State of Texas, hereby accepts the attached ordinance and agrees to be bound by all of its terms, conditions, and provisions, subject to federal, state, and local law.

    Sec. 33.02. Acceptance of franchise not a waiver. Acceptance of this franchise by grantee shall not constitute a waiver by it of any of its constitutional or other rights. 
Article XXXIV. - Severability. 
    Sec. 34.01. Provisions severable. If any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this franchise ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this franchise ordinance. It is the intent of town in adopting this franchise ordinance that no portion or provision thereof shall become inoperative or fail by reason of any invalidity or unconstitutionality of any other portion or provision, and to this end all provisions of this franchise ordinance are declared to be severable.

Re: Year 2000 Readiness 
Dear: 
    The entity you recently inquired about, (TCI Entity), is included in TCI's Year 2000 readiness program. The information set forth herein supersedes any other correspondence o [or] information that you may have received from TCI regarding TCI's Year 2000 status. Additionally, please refer to TCI's most recent filing on Form 10-Q or Form I0-K. 
    According to many commentators, the arrival of the Year 2000 will present far-reaching challenges for most members of the business community. At TCI, we have recognized the areas of our business operations which may be impacted by the Year 2000 and are working to ready our company in a thoughtful and orderly manner. 
    TCI has formed a Year 2000 Program Management Office (the PMO) which has been charged with, among other things, working toward making TCI's critical operations Year 2000 ready. The PMO reports to a committee of senior-level executives who are responsible for many of TCI's business units; the committee is chaired by our president, Leo J. Hindery, Jr. TCI has retained a full-time Year 2000 Program Director to run the PMO and has engaged Year 2000 consultants who are associated with a major international accounting firm to assist the PMO. In addition, TCI has hired other Year 2000 specialists to focus on specific operations of the company. 
    The PMO is currently coordinating several initiatives related to the Year 2000 issue. TCI is completing the survey and inventory of the software, hardware, equipment and facilities which might be affected by the arrival of the Year 2000. The remediation (repair or replacement) and testing processes of such systems are underway. 
    Furthermore, TCI has recognized the need to determine the Year 2000 readiness of its important vendors and affiliates. The PMO is surveying its vendors and has received information that most critical systems, services or products supplied to TCI by third parties are either Year 2000 ready or are expected to be Year 2000 ready by mid-1999. Additionally, the PMO is holding meetings with key cable, programming and other affiliates to evaluate their respective Year 2000 compliance programs. 
    At this time, TCI has not made a complete determination of the remediation and other costs associated with resolving Year 2000 readiness issues. However, based on data collected to date, TCI estimates that the final costs of Year 2000 remediation will be no less than $126,000,000.00. 
    Further, the PMO is currently completing its planning processes and has not yet established a firm date for completion of the Year 2000 remediation and testing efforts. We expect that our critical systems will be Year 2000 ready by the third quarter of 1999. 
    Please note that all Year 2000 statements contained in this letter are hereby denominated as "Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure" within the meaning of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act. 
    At TCI, we recognize your continuing interest in this issue. Please feel free to contact me at (303) 267-4810, fax (303) 488-3207 if you have further questions or need an update on TCI's status.

Grantee shall not be responsible for failure to complete the system in the above stated time because of unusual inclement weather conditions, labor strikes, material shortages, or circumstances beyond its control. 
    Grantee shall collect no money from inhabitants of city until grantee is ready to render service of this system to said inhabitants. 
Editor's note- Exhibit A referred to herein has not been set out in this Code but is on file and available for inspection in the offices of the city. 
Section 9. - Rate regulation. 
(a)  At such time, if and when the Federal Communication Commission ("FCC") permits the city to regulate the rates, charges and fares of grantee, the city council shall thereafter have the full power allowed by law and subject to the regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and reserves the right, after notice and hearing, to regulate by ordinance the rates, charges and fares of grantee. Rates shall be subject to adjustment, as provided for herein, so as to permit grantee to recover its operating expenses, together with a reasonable return on its invested capital. The initial rates to be charged by grantee are those fixed in exhibit "B" attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

    Grantee shall petition city at a regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body and shall notify the subscribers to the system of the request of the increase by publishing notice of such request in the official paper of city. 
    City shall call a public hearing on grantee's request for rate increase. The hearing shall be set within 60 days of the petition being filed. If city decides not to call a public hearing within 60 days, grantee may increase its basic rate only by seven percent without further city action. 
    Should city require assistance in evaluation of the rate request, such assistance will be underwritten by grantee, and such cost shall be recoverable through the additional rates which may be allowed. However, costs incurred by grantee for the purpose of applying for rate increases shall not be considered as operating expenses; and therefore, shall not be recoverable through additional rates. 
    Any period of time may be extended for any period by joint agreement of city and grantee. 
Section 10. - Conditions on street occupancy. 
(a)  All transmissions and distributions, structures, lines, and equipment erected by grantee within the city shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of streets, and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the said streets, or other public ways and places. 
(b)  In case of disturbance of any street, sidewalk, public way, or paved area, grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the director of streets, replace and restore such street, sidewalk, public way, or paved area in as good a condition as before the work involving such disturbance was done.

Such consent may be given or withheld upon such terms and conditions as the city manager or his designee deems appropriate. Each grantee shall be responsible for, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city and its officers, agents and employees from and against any and all damages arising out of or resulting from the removal, trimming, mutilation of or any injury to any tree or trees proximately caused by the grantee or its officers, agents, employees, contractors or subcontractors. 
Section 11. - Erection of poles. 
(a)  This franchise shall not be deemed to expressly or impliedly authorize the grantee to construct or install poles or wire-holding structures within streets for the purpose of placing cables, wires, lines or otherwise, without the written consent of the city within which the street is situated. Such consent shall be given upon such terms and conditions as the city in its sole discretion may prescribe, which shall include a requirement that the grantee perform, at its sole expense, all tree trimming required to maintain the poles clear of obstructions. 
(b)  Grantee and appropriate public utilities shall work together as far as is practicable to ensure that pole, conduits, and other wire-holding structures owned or installed by one of them be utilized by the other so as to minimize the number of such structure within the city. 
(c)  Any and all poles to be placed shall be of sound material and reasonably straight, and shall be so set and maintained that they will not interfere with the flow of water to any gutter or drain, and so that the same will interfere as little as practicable with the ordinary travel on the street or sidewalk. Grantee shall comply with city's general design standards and construction specifications and state and federal regulations affecting its installations. Grantee shall comply with all applicable subdivision restrictions, including but not limited to underground placement of facilities. Any proposed installation of company facilities upon city property, including streets, must be specifically approved by the city engineer prior to any work being done. The city engineer shall use his best efforts to provide space for the company facilities in the city property. However, company use of city's property is dependent upon design considerations. 
(d)  Grantee shall use only new cables and equipment with such shielding and protective devices as may be necessary to insure the best possible service with the least possible interference. In those areas where telephone and electric service lines are underground, the grantee shall place its cables and service lines underground. In the event grantee after notice fails or refuses to act, city shall have the power to remove or abate the same at the expense of grantee, all without compensation or liability for damages from city to grantee. 
(e)  Where electric and telephone lines are being installed in a new subdivision within city, company will use its best efforts to install its cables in such new subdivision at the time the electric and telephone utility lines are installed in the subdivision, such installation of cables to be at company's expense. 
(f)  All installations made by grantee shall be made in good, substantial and safe condition and shall be maintained in such condition at all times. 
(g)  Any relocation of company facilities required by the public convenience in order to improve, open, widen, grade or change in any manner, the existing or proposed city streets, and rights-of-way or required by improvements of any nature to other city lands, shall be borne solely by the company. Any relocation of company facilities required by the public convenience in order to construct, reconstruct, renew, repair or maintain any city-owned utility facility, shall be borne solely by company.

Grantee shall be given not less than 48 hours oral or written notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
Section 13. - Streets to be restored to good condition. 
(a)  The surface and all appurtenant structures of any street, or public place and the trees located thereon within the city disturbed by the company in building, constructing, renewing or maintaining its cable and system shall be restored within a reasonable time to as good a condition as before the commencement of the work and maintained to the satisfaction of the city engineer. No such street, or public place shall be encumbered for a longer period than shall be necessary to execute the work. 
(b)  Company and its contractors shall provide such safety barricades, lights and other warning devices in accordance with the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as are reasonable and necessary to warn the public, upon the streets, and public places within the city while it is in the process of building, constructing, renewing or maintaining its cable and system, and for such time thereafter as is necessary to restore the street or other public place. 
Section 14. - Franchise fee. 
    For the use of the streets and for the purposes of providing revenue with which to defray the costs of regulation arising out of the granting of franchises under this ordinance and promoting, assisting and financing public, educational, and governmental access programming, grantee shall pay franchise fees as follows: 
    Company agrees to pay to city quarterly during the pendency of this franchise a sum of money equal to four percent, or the maximum percentage permitted by the Federal Communications Commission, of the quarterly gross revenues company has received from subscribers within the corporate limits of the city during the preceding calendar quarter. The first payment hereunder shall be equal in an amount to four percent of the gross revenues from the date of acceptance of this ordinance through the last day of the first full calendar quarter following acceptance of this ordinance, and shall be made within 60 days following the last day of the period for which the payment is calculated; and thereafter payment shall be made quarterly, on or before the last day of the second calendar month of each succeeding calendar quarter, as herein provided. Late payments shall bear interest at the maximum amount allowable by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, grantee shall not be required to pay franchise fees at a rate higher than that collected by city from any other franchised cable television system operator. 
Section 15. - Accounting standards. 
    Not less than annually, grantee shall provide city with an unqualified certification of an independent certified public accountant certifying the accuracy of the quarterly franchise fee payments paid within the preceding 12 months pursuant to section 14 above. Said certification shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. 
Section 16. - Auditing and financial records. 
(a)  During the term of each franchise, city may, not more frequently than once each year, conduct an audit of the books, records and accounts of grantee for the purpose of determining whether grantee has paid franchise fees in the amounts prescribed by section 14 above. The audit may be conducted by city or by an independent certified public accounting firm retained by city, and shall be conducted at the sole expense of city. The party conducting the audit shall prepare a written report containing its findings, and the report shall be filed with city, and mailed to grantee.

(b)  Each policy of insurance shall contain a statement on its face that the insurer will not cancel the policy or fail to renew the policy, whether for nonpayment of premium, or otherwise, and whether at the request of grantee or for other reasons, except after 30 calendar days advance written notice mailed by the insurer to the city secretary.

(1)  Have Electric Delivery Utility select, within 30 days of the City's request, any or all portions of the franchise agreement with the other municipality or comparable provisions that, at Electric Delivery Utility 's sole discretion, must be considered in conjunction with the different method of the calculation of franchise fees included in that other franchise agreement; and 
(2)  Modify this franchise to include both the different method of calculation of franchise fee found in the franchise agreement with the other municipality and all of the other provisions identified by Electric Delivery Utility pursuant to Section 5.4(a). In no event shall City be able to modify the franchise to include the different method of calculation of franchise fee found in the franchise agreement with the other municipality without this franchise also being modified to include all of the other provisions identified by Electric Delivery Utility pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(1). 
(b)  City may not exercise the option provided in Section 5.4(a) if any of the provisions that would be included in this franchise are, in Electric Delivery Utility's sole opinion, inconsistent with or in any manner contrary to any then-current rule, regulation, ordinance, law, Code, or Charter of City. 
(c)  In the event of a regulatory disallowance of the increase in franchise fees paid pursuant to City's exercise of its option under this Section, then at any time after the regulatory authority's entry of an order disallowing recovery of the additional franchise fee expense in rates, Electric Delivery Utility shall have the right to cancel the modification of the franchise made pursuant to this Section, and terms of the franchise shall immediately revert to those in place prior to City's exercise of its option under this Section. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this franchise, should the City exercise the option provided in Section 5.4(a), and then adopt any rule, regulation, ordinance, law, Code, or Charter of City that, in Electric Delivery Utility's sole opinion, is inconsistent with or in any manner contrary to the provisions included in this franchise pursuant to Section 5.4(a), then Electric Delivery Utility shall have the right to cancel all of the modifications to this franchise made pursuant to this Section and, effective as of the date of the City's adoption of the inconsistent provision, the terms of the franchise shall revert to those in place prior to City's exercise of its option under this Section. 
(e)  The provisions of this Section apply only to the amount of the franchise fee to be paid and do not apply to other franchise fee payment provisions, such as the timing of such payments. The provisions of this Section do not apply to differences in the franchise fee factor that result from the application of the methodology set out in Section 33.008(b) of PURA or any successor methodology. 
    5.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.1 hereof, if during the term of this Franchise the Electric Delivery Utility files general rate cases and the City incurs cumulative expenses in connection with all general rate cases filed during the period beginning June 1, 1993, and ending August 24, 2008 which would otherwise have been reimbursable by Electric Delivery Utility under Section 33.023 of PURA, as amended, or similar or successor law, in excess of Four Million and No/100 Dollars ($4,000,000.00), then in such event, the Electric Delivery Utility shall reimburse all of the expenses incurred by the City in connection with all general rate cases filed during the period beginning June 1, 1993, and ending August 24, 2008, in excess of said $4,000,000.00. The term "general rate case" as used in this Ordinance means a rate case initiated by the Electric Delivery Utility in which it seeks to increase its rates charged to a substantial number of its customer classes in the City and elsewhere in its system and in which the Electric Delivery Utility's overall revenues are determined in setting such rates. The City agrees to exercise reasonable best efforts, considering the facts and circumstances, to keep its expenses on average to under One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per general rate case. 
    5.6 Notwithstanding the above section 5.1, City reserves its rights and does not waive any claim that Ordinance No. 093-041 requires reimbursement of general rate case expenses incurred by the City after August 24, 2008, and ending with the term of this Franchise, that would have been otherwise reimbursable by Electric Delivery Utility under Section 33.023 of PURA, as amended, or similar or successor law.

SECTION 6. - Audit of electric delivery utility's records and reports. 
    6.1 Books of Account. The Electric Delivery Utility shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts and records of its business and operations under and in connection with this Franchise. To the extent practicable, all such books of accounts and records shall be made available at the Electric Delivery Utility's principal office in Dallas, Texas. 
    6.2 Access by City. The City Manager or the City Manager's designee shall, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Electric Delivery Utility, have the right to access and to inspect the books of accounts and records of the Electric Delivery Utility for the period then subject to audit under Section 33.008(e) of the Public Utility Regulatory Act to ascertain the correctness of any payments and reports to the City, as provided for in Section 33.008(e) of the Public Utility Regulatory Act, and as to the Electric Delivery Utility's compliance with this Franchise, and Electric Delivery Utility shall fully cooperate in making available its accounts and records and otherwise assisting in these activities. 
    6.3 Audits. The City Manager may cause to be conducted no more than once annually, an audit to verify the accuracy of the method used to compute the Electric Delivery Utility's Franchise Fee payments to the City and to verify that all utility accounts within the City are properly included in the computation of the Franchise Fee. Said audit shall be limited to the time period subject to audit under PURA Section 33.008(e). If either party discovers that the Electric Delivery Utility has failed to pay the entire or correct amount of compensation due, the correct amount shall be determined and the City shall be paid by the Electric Delivery Utility within thirty (30) calendar days of such determination. Any overpayment to the City through error or otherwise will, at the option of the City, either be refunded within thirty (30) days of determination OR be offset against the next payment due from Electric Delivery Utility. Such payments shall include interest as provided for in Section 5.2. 
(Ord. No. 005-010, 2-22-05) 
SECTION 7. - Annexation. 
    This Franchise shall extend to and include any and all territory that is annexed by or otherwise added to the corporate limits of the City during the term of this Franchise. Upon receipt of written notification by the City of newly annexed areas, or other areas added to the City limits, the Electric Delivery Utility shall promptly initiate a process to reclassify affected customers into the City limits in a timely manner. The annexed areas or other areas added to the City limits will be included in future franchise payments in accordance with the effective date of the annexation. Upon request from the City, the Electric Delivery Utility will provide documentation to verify that affected customers were appropriately reclassified and included for purposes of calculating franchise payments. 
(Ord. No. 005-010, 2-22-05) 
SECTION 8. - Construction in the public rights-of-way. 
    8.1 In connection with any activity of, by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of the Electric Delivery Utility on or within the Public Rights-of-Way under this Franchise, the Electric Delivery Utility shall comply with the City Charter and all lawful ordinances, rules, codes, laws, standards, policies, and regulations of the City (including, without limitation, the right-of-way construction, permitting, and relocation provisions of the Code of Ordinances) as now existing or as the same may be adopted, supplemented, amended or revised (together, "City Standards"). To the extent any City Standards conflict with this Franchise, the requirements of this Franchise shall govern. The Electric Delivery Utility shall also comply with any and all applicable laws, standards, policies, regulations, and rules, whether federal or state. This Franchise shall in no way affect or impair the rights, obligations or remedies of the parties under the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, or other State or Federal Law. Nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver, release or relinquishment of either party's right to contest, appeal, or file suit with respect to any action or decision of the other party, including, without limitation, ordinances adopted by the City, that it believes is contrary to any federal, state or local law or regulation. To the extent practicable City shall provide Electric Delivery Utility with reasonable notice and opportunity to review and comment upon any new or revised City Standards that impact Electric Delivery Utility's use of the Public Rights-of-Way. 
    8.2 Electric Delivery Utility shall locate, install, use, maintain, repair, construct, operate, and replace its Facilities to minimize interference with traffic (motor vehicle, pedestrian, or otherwise) and shall perform work in a timely and expeditious manner, and shall promptly clean up and restore to the approximate condition at the time disturbed, all Public Rights-of-Way that it may disturb to the satisfaction of the City consistent with applicable City Standards. With respect to Electric Delivery Utility Facilities not located in public streets, alleys or highways, to the extent the Electric Delivery Utility is authorized to locate such Facilities in Public Rights-of-Way other than public streets, alleys, or highways, the location of Electric Delivery Utility's Facilities shall be subject to approval by the City Manager prior to construction or installation; provided however, said approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. When Electric Delivery Utility makes, or causes to be made, excavations, or places, or causes to be placed, obstructions in any Public Rights-of-Way, Electric Delivery Utility shall place, erect, and maintain barriers and lights to identify the location of such excavations or obstructions, all in accordance with the most recent edition of the Uniform Manual on Traffic Control Devices and applicable City Standards. In determining the location of Electric Delivery Utility's Facilities within the City, the Electric Delivery Utility shall not interfere with then existing above-ground or underground structures, equipment and facilities of the City, other utility franchisees (which have received a franchise from the City to use the Public Rights-of-Way), and other persons (whether a natural person or business entity of any kind) who have received the City's consent to place and locate equipment and facilities within the Public Rights-of-Way (such other utility franchisees and other persons being "Public Right-of-Way Users"). The City will seek, after the effective date of this Franchise, to include in its agreements with other utilities and users of the Public Rights-of-way provisions requiring that such users shall not interfere with the Electric Delivery Utility Facilities. The Company recognizes that it is the responsibility of other utility franchisees and Public Rights-of- Way Users to ensure that their activities do not interfere or damage the Electric Delivery Utility facilities and will pursue any damage claims directly with the responsible Public Rights-of-Way Users. The Electric Delivery Utility shall be responsible to repair at its sole cost all damage caused by Electric Delivery Utility activities pursuant to this Franchise. If any such damage poses a threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public or residents, Electric Delivery Utility, upon receipt of notice, shall take prompt actions to mitigate the health, safety or welfare concerns and shall promptly initiate repairs. If the City requests the Electric Delivery Utility to initiate repairs and the Electric Delivery Utility fails to initiate and timely complete repairs within a reasonable time after the City's request, after notice to the Electric Delivery Utility of the City's intent, the City may repair or cause repairs to be made at the Electric Delivery Utility's expense, and Electric Delivery Utility shall promptly pay to the City the actual cost incurred by the City in making or causing such repairs. The Electric Delivery Utility shall require its contractors working in the Public Rights-of-Way to hold all necessary contracting licenses and permits required by the City, or otherwise required by any law, rule, or regulation, for such business. Except as otherwise provided for herein, in determining the location of the facilities of the City, the City shall minimize interference with then existing Facilities of the Electric Delivery Utility. In the event of a conflict between the location of the proposed Facilities of the Electric Delivery Utility and the location of the existing facilities of the City or other Public Right-of-Way Users within Public Rights-of-Way that cannot otherwise be resolved, the City or an authorized agent of the City shall use its reasonable efforts and attempt to resolve the conflict and determine the location of the respective facilities, provided that if the City determines in such instance that proposed Facilities of the Electric Delivery Utility must be relocated from that proposed by the Electric Delivery Utility, the City will designate a reasonable alternate location within the Public Rights-of-Way for Electric Delivery Utility. Except in an emergency, the Electric Delivery Utility shall be required to obtain street cutting, street excavation or other special permits related to excavations in Public Rights-of-Way in connection with the Electric Delivery Utility's operations in Public Rights-of-Way in accordance with City Standards. Under no circumstances, however, shall the Electric Delivery Utility be required to pay for such permitting or be required to post bonds. 
    8.3 The City reserves the right for any reason whatsoever to use, change the grade of, construct, install, repair, alter, maintain, relocate, modify, open, close, reduce, or widen (collectively "change") any Public Right-of-Way, within the present or future limits of the City. At the City's request, the Electric Delivery Utility shall relocate or remove its Facilities in order to accommodate such change of any Public Right-of-Way. If the Electric Delivery Utility is required by the City to remove or relocate its Facilities, Electric Delivery Utility shall be entitled to reimbursement from the City of the cost and expense of such removal or relocation except to the extent PURA Section 37.101(c) or other state or federal law requires or permits the City to require, the relocation to be done at Electric Delivery Utility's expense. 
    8.4 If the City abandons any Public Right-of-Way in which the Electric Delivery Utility has Facilities, such abandonment shall be conditioned on the Electric Delivery Utility's right to maintain its use of the former Public Right-of-Way and on the obligation of the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned to reimburse Electric Delivery Utility for all removal or relocation expenses if Electric Delivery Utility agrees to the removal or relocation of its facilities following abandonment of the Public Right-of-Way. If the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned requests Electric Delivery Utility to remove or relocate its facilities and Electric Delivery Utility agrees to such removal or relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable time at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation. If relocation cannot practically be made to another Public Right-of-Way, the expense of any right-of-way acquisition shall be considered a relocation expense to be reimbursed by the party requesting the relocation. 
    8.5 The Electric Delivery Utility shall install, construct, repair, maintain and replace its Facilities in a good and workmanlike manner. 
    8.6 City Inspection. The City retains the right to make visual, non-invasive inspections of the Electric Delivery Utility's Facilities. 
    8.7 Temporary Removal of Wires. The Electric Delivery Utility on the request of any person shall remove or raise or lower its wires within the City temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures. The total expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the benefited party or parties, and Electric Delivery Utility may require such full payment in advance. Electric Delivery Utility shall be given not less than thirty (30) days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. The clearance of wires above ground or rails within the City and also underground work shall conform to the basic standards of the National Electrical Safety Code.

    (D) WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTRIC DELIVERY UTILITY'S DUTY TO DEFEND SET FORTH HEREIN IN SUBSECTION (A), THE ELECTRIC DELIVERY UTILITY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELECT DEFENSE COUNSEL, SUBJECT TO CITY'S APPROVAL, WHICH WILL NOT BE UNREASONABLY WITHHELD. ELECTRIC DELIVERY UTILITY SHALL RETAIN DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN SEVEN (7) BUSINESS DAYS OF RECEIPT OF CITY'S WRITTEN NOTICE THAT CITY IS INVOKING ITS RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS FRANCHISE AGREEMENT. IF ELECTRIC DELIVERY UTILITY FAILS TO RETAIN COUNSEL WITHIN SUCH TIME PERIOD, CITY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETAIN DEFENSE COUNSEL ON ITS OWN BEHALF, AND ELECTRIC DELIVERY UTILITY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ALL REASONABLE AND NECESSARY DEFENSE COSTS INCURRED BY CITY, EXCEPT AS LIMITED IN SUBSECTIONS (B) AND (C) OF THIS SECTION. 
    9.2 Electric Delivery Utility may self-insure to the extent permitted by applicable law under any plan of self-insurance, maintained in accordance with sound accounting practices, against risks and obligations undertaken pursuant to this franchise and shall not be required to maintain insurance; provided that Electric Delivery Utility furnishes the City satisfactory evidence of the existence of an insurance reserve adequate for the risks covered by such plan of self-insurance. Electric Delivery Utility shall provide the City with evidence of the form and basis for insurance coverage or self insurance, as applicable, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this franchise ordinance. Provided however that the Electric Delivery Utility's self-insurance shall provide to the City, its officers, employees and agents, with the same defense as would be provided by an insurance carrier and with substantially the same coverage as required by other users of the Public Right-of-Way in the City as set forth in Chapter 70 of the Code of Ordinances, currently or as it may be amended (or any successor ordinance or regulation). Should Electric Delivery Utility elect to change the form or basis of insurance during the term of this franchise, Electric Delivery Utility shall notify the City. Electric Delivery Utility shall provide documentation necessary for review by the City of the changed circumstances of Electric Delivery Utility.

    Prior to assignment, transfer, pledge or other conveyance of its rights, duties and obligations under this franchise, except to an affiliated entity, Electric Delivery Utility shall obtain prior written consent of the governing body of the City, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c)  if the Electric Delivery Utility reasonably believes that the failure specified in the notice from the City is not a failure of a material provision of this Franchise, submit to the City within ten (10) days after its receipt of the notice the Electric Delivery Utility's written response specifying facts and presenting arguments in refutation or defense of such alleged failure (the "Electric Delivery Utility's Defense"). 
    12.2 In the event that the Electric Delivery Utility does not comply with subparagraphs (a), (b), or (c) above, or if the Electric Delivery Utility does comply with subparagraph (c) above but the City, after its review of the Electric Delivery Utility's Defense, nevertheless believes that the Electric Delivery Utility has failed to comply with a material provision of this Franchise, the City may declare this an Uncured Event of Default, which shall entitle City to exercise the remedies provided for in Section 12.3. Notice of such declaration shall be given to the Electric Delivery Utility prior to the City's exercise of any such remedies. 
    12.3 Not sooner than seven (7) days following the City's declaration of an Uncured Event of Default and the giving of notice of such declaration to the Electric Delivery Utility, the City shall be entitled to exercise any and/or all of the following remedies:

The final decision of the City Council may be appealed to any court or regulatory authority having jurisdiction within thirty days following the effective date of such final decision. Upon timely appeal by Electric Delivery Utility of the City Council's decision terminating the Franchise, the effective date of such termination shall be either when such appeal is withdrawn or a court or administrative order upholding the termination becomes final and unappealable. Until the termination becomes effective the provisions of this Franchise shall remain in effect for all purposes.

    Failure of the City to declare, or any delay by the City in taking any action in connection with, any breach or default of this Franchise by the Electric Delivery Utility immediately upon the occurrence thereof shall not constitute or be construed to be a waiver by the City of such breach or default, but the City shall have the right to declare any such breach or default at any time. Failure of the City to declare one breach or default of the Electric Delivery Utility does not act as a waiver of the City's rights to declare another breach or default. By entering into this ordinance, City does not waive any claim which the City may have under the Prior Electric Franchise, except to the extent any such claims were settled in that certain Compromise Settlement Release agreement signed by the City on October 24, 2002.

ARTICLE III. - TELEPHONES[7] 
ORDINANCE NO. 092-033 
    AN ORDINANCE WHEREBY THE TOWN OF ADDISON, TEXAS, AND SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY AGREE THAT, FOR THE PURPOSE OF OPERATING ITS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS, THE TELEPHONE COMPANY SHALL MAINTAIN AND CONSTRUCT ITS POLES, WIRES, ANCHORS, FIBER, CABLES, MANHOLES, CONDUITS AND OTHER PHYSICAL PLANT AND APPURTENANCES IN, ALONG, ACROSS, ON, OVER, THROUGH, ABOVE AND UNDER ALL PUBLIC STREETS, AVENUE, HIGHWAYS, ALLEYS, SIDEWALKS, BRIDGES OR PUBLIC WAYS IN SAID CITY; PRESCRIBING THE ANNUAL COMPENSATION DUE THE CITY UNDER THIS ORDINANCE; PRESCRIBING THE CONDITIONS GOVERNING THE USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN CONSTRUCTION WORK ON PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR THE TELEPHONE COMPANY'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS; PROVIDING AN INDEMNITY CLAUSE; SPECIFYING GOVERNING LAWS; PROVIDING FOR A RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS UNDER PRIOR ORDINANCES; PROVIDING FOR FUTURE CONTINGENCIES; PROVIDING FOR WRITTEN ACCEPTANCE OF THIS ORDINANCE BY THE TELEPHONE COMPANY; AND PROVIDING FOR A TERM AND AN EFFECTIVE DATE. 
    WHEREAS, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (hereinafter referred to as the "telephone company") is now and has been engaged in the telecommunications business in the State of Texas and in furtherance thereof, has erected and maintained certain items of its physical plant in the Town of Addison, Texas (hereinafter referred to as the "city") for many years pursuant to such rights as have been granted it by and under the laws of the State of Texas, and subject to the reasonable exercise of the police powers granted by and under said laws to the city; and 
    WHEREAS, the telephone company has operated its telecommunications business in the city under successive ordinances of the city, the last of which was Ordinance Number 4, adopted November 9, 1953, which provided compensation to the city for the superintendence of that agreement based upon a percentage of gross receipts received by the telephone company from certain local services rendered within the corporate limits of the city; and 
    WHEREAS, it is recognized by the parties that changes in the telecommunications industry, changes in technology, changes in state and federal law, and changes in the accounting practices mandated by the Uniform System of Accounts promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), along with regulatory requirements of the Texas Public Utility Commission ("PUC"), have caused the traditional method of determining the amount of compensation to municipalities to become administratively impractical and obsolete for telecommunications utilities. In order to resolve these issues in a manner satisfactory to both the city and the telephone company, the city and the telephone company have chosen the method of determining the amount of compensation provided for in this ordinance to eliminate the expense and time related to audits, to achieve administrative simplicity, to provide the city with predictable revenues and an opportunity for growth and to avoid the expense and delays of litigation which could be necessary to resolve any issues in controversy between the parties; and 
    WHEREAS, it is to the mutual advantage of both the city and the telephone company that an agreement should be entered into between the telephone company and the city establishing the conditions under which the telephone company shall maintain and construct its physical plant in the city in the future; 
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE TOWN COUNCIL OF THE TOWN OF ADDISON, TEXAS, THAT:

The terms of this ordinance shall apply throughout the city, and to all operations of the telephone company within the city, and shall include all operations and facilities used in whole or in part in the provision of telecommunications services in newly annexed areas upon the effective date of any annexation. 
Section 2. - Additional authority required. 
    The telephone company is not authorized to provide cable television service as a cable operator in the city under this ordinance, but must first obtain a franchise from the city for that purpose, under such terms and conditions as may be required by law.

    Whenever used in this ordinance, the following words and terms shall have the definitions and meanings provided in this section: 
(a)  Facilities. All telephone company duct spaces, manholes, poles, conduits, underground and overhead passageways, and other equipment, structures and appurtenances and all associated transmission media.

Section 4. - Term. 
    This ordinance shall continue for a period of five years from the effective date; provided that at the expiration of the initial period, such term may be extended by mutual written agreement of the city and telephone company. 
Section 5. - Supervision by city of location of poles and conduits. 
    All poles placed shall be of sound material and reasonably straight, and shall be set so that they will not interfere with the flow of water in any gutter or drain, and so that the same will not unreasonably interfere with ordinary travel on the streets or sidewalks. The location and route of all poles, stubs, guys, anchors, conduits, fiber and cables placed and constructed by the telephone company in the construction and maintenance of its telecommunications system in the city shall be subject to the lawful control and direction of the city.

    Nothing contained in this ordinance shall be construed to require or permit any pole attachments for electric light or power wires or communications facilities or systems not owned or provided by the telephone company to be attached to the telephone company's poles or other physical plant or placed in the telephone company's conduit. If the city desires pole attachments for electric light or power wires or communications facilities or systems not provided by the telephone company, or if the city desires to place communications facilities or systems not provided by the telephone company in any telephone company duct, then a further separate, noncontingent agreement shall be prerequisite to such attachment(s) or such use of any duct by the city. Nothing contained in this ordinance shall obligate or restrict the telephone company in exercising its rights voluntarily to enter into pole attachment, pole usage, joint ownership or other wire space or facilities agreements with light and/or power companies or with other wire-using companies which have been granted a license or franchise by the city. 
Section 7. - Streets to be restored to preexisting condition. 
    The rights-of-way of any public street, avenue, highway, alley or public place disturbed by the telephone company in the construction or maintenance of its telecommunications system shall be restored within a reasonable time after the completion of the work to as good a condition as before the commencement of the work. Should the city reasonably determine, within one year from the date of such restoration, that such rights-of-way require additional restoration work to place it in as good a condition as before the commencement of the work, the telephone company shall perform such additional restoration work to the reasonable satisfaction of the city. No public street, avenue, highway, alley or public place shall be encumbered for a longer period than shall be necessary to execute all work, and such work shall comply with existing ordinances regarding excavations in rights-of-way. 
Section 8. - Temporary rearrangement of aerial wires. 
    Upon request, the telephone company shall remove or raise or lower its aerial wires, fiber or cables temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures. The expense of such temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting them, and the telephone company may require payment in advance. The telephone company shall be given not less than 48 hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary rearrangements. 
Section 9. - Tree trimming. 
    The right, license, privilege and permission is hereby granted to the telephone company, its contractors and agents, to trim trees upon and overhanging the streets, avenues, highways, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the aerial wires, fiber or cables of the telephone company, and when so directed by the city, said trimming shall be done under the supervision and direction of the city or of any city official to whom said duties have been or may be delegated. 
Section 10. - Indemnity. 
    The telephone company shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from all costs, expenses (including attorney's fees) and damages to persons or property arising directly or indirectly out of the construction, maintenance or operation of the telephone company's facilities located within the public rights-of-way found to be caused solely by the negligence of the telephone company. This provision is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the telephone company and the city, nor is this provision intended to abrogate the common law or statutory rights of either the city or the telephone company to indemnity or contribution from the other. 
Section 11. - Administration of ordinance. 
(a)  The city may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to this ordinance and the telephone company shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. 
(b)  Copies of petitions, applications, communications and reports submitted by the telephone company to the Federal Communications Commission or the Public Utility Commission of Texas shall be provided to the city upon request. 
(c)  The city may establish, after reasonable notice, such rules and regulations as may be appropriate for the administration of this ordinance and the construction of the telephone company's facilities on public property to the extent permitted by law. 
Section 12. - Compensation to the city. 
(a)  As compensation for the use, occupancy, oversight, supervision and regulation of the city's rights-of-way, and in lieu of and in full compensation for any lawful tax or license or charge or right-of-way permit fee or inspection fee, whether charged to the telephone company or its contractor(s) or any right-of-way easement or street or alley rental or franchise tax or other character of charge for use and occupancy of the rights-of-way within the city, except the usual general ad valorem taxes, special assessments in accordance with state law or sales taxes now or hereafter levied by the city in accordance with state law, the city hereby imposes a charge upon the gross receipts (as hereinafter defined) of the telephone company. The amount of the charge for the first year this ordinance is in effect shall be $547,500.00. In no event shall such charge be less than the above amount for each year this ordinance is in effect, except as provided in the case of disannexation as set forth in paragraph 12(e), or as provided in section 16 herein. The telephone company will, according to tariff, bill such charge to the customers who are billed the customer service charges included within the term "gross receipts," as defined herein. Gross receipts, for purposes of this charge, shall include only customer service charges which meet all four of the following conditions: 
(1)  Such charges are for telephone company services provided within the city; 
(2)  Such charges are billed through the telephone company's customer records information system ("CRIS"); 
(3)  Such charges are the recurring charges for the local exchange access rate element specified in the telephone company's tariffs filed with the PUC; and 
(4)  Such charges are subject to an interstate end user common line ("EUCL") charge as imposed by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"). 
    For the second and subsequent calendar years while this ordinance remains in effect, the above charge is subject to adjustment by application of the growth factor set out in paragraph 12(c). This adjustment for the growth factor will be made effective as of each anniversary date of this ordinance. The telephone company shall adjust its billings to customers to account for any undercollection or overcollection of the charge due the city. 
(b)  The charge for each year shall be paid in four equal payments. The dates shall be February 28, May 31, August 31, and November 30, with the first payment under this ordinance due on November 30, 1992. In the event of any over or undercollection from customers at the expiration of this ordinance, the telephone company may make a pro rata one-time credit or charge to the customer billing for affected customers who are billed for a service included within gross receipts, as defined in paragraph 12(a). This will be accomplished within 150 days following the date of expiration of this ordinance. If, however, it is impractical to credit any overcollection to customers, then such overcollection shall be paid to the city. 
(c)  The growth factor shall be calculated by dividing the telephone company's revenues within the corporate limits of the city subject to the state telecommunications sales tax ("sales tax revenues") applicable to services rendered within the corporate limits of the city for the 12-month period ending three months prior to the next anniversary date of the ordinance by the sales tax revenues for the 12-month period ending three months prior to either the initial effective date or the preceding anniversary date of this ordinance as applicable. The growth factor calculated by the method set forth in the preceding sentence, if greater than one, shall be multiplied by the current year's charge to determine the dollar amount of the charge for the next year. If the growth factor calculated above is one or less, the charge for the next year shall be equal to the current year's charge. The telephone company will adjust its customer billing to account for the growth factor calculated above. Once the growth factor calculation is completed, the telephone company will provide the city with the sales tax revenues upon which the growth factor calculation was based. 
    The city agrees to rely upon audits by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts of state telecommunications sales taxes as reported by the telephone company which are performed in compliance with V.T.C.A., Tax Code §§ 151.023, 151.027. The growth factor shall be recomputed to reflect any final, nonappealable adjustments made pursuant to an audit finding by the Texas comptroller of an inaccuracy in the telephone company's reports of revenues subject to state telecommunications sales taxes. The charge shall be recalculated using the growth factor recomputed as specified in the preceding sentence, and the recalculated charge shall be used for all future calculations required by this ordinance. Any overpayment or underpayment resulting from such recalculation shall be subtracted from or added to the first installment due the following year. If any overpayment or underpayment shall be due during the final year of this ordinance, then payment shall be made as follows. In the case of overpayment by the telephone company, the city shall pay such overpayment to the telephone company within 150 days following the expiration of this ordinance and, in the case of underpayment by the telephone company, the telephone company shall pay such underpayment to the city within 150 days following the expiration of this ordinance. 
(d)  Such payments shall not relieve the telephone company from paying all applicable municipally owned utility service charges. Should the city not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing annual charge shall be in lieu of the taxes, licenses, charges, right-of-way permit or inspection fees, rentals, rights-of-way easements or franchise taxes aforesaid, then the city agrees that it will apply so much of such payments as may be necessary to the satisfaction of the telephone company's obligation, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses, charges, right-of-way permit or inspection fees, rentals, rights-of-way easements or franchise taxes. 
(e)  In the event that either (1) territory within the boundaries of the city shall be disannexed and a new incorporated municipality created which includes such territory or (2) an entire, existing incorporated municipality shall be consolidated or annexed into the city, then notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, the charge shall be adjusted. 
To accomplish this adjustment, within 30 days following the action effecting a disannexation/annexation as described above, the city shall provide the telephone company with maps of the affected area(s), showing the new boundaries of the city. In the event of an annexation as described above, the charge for the city will be adjusted to include the amount of the payment by the telephone company to the existing incorporated municipality being annexed. In the event that the annexed municipality had no ordinance imposing a charge or in the event of a disannexation, then the adjustment to the charge will be calculated using the effective date of the imposition of local sales taxes as determined by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. The adjustment shall be the percent increase/decrease in the telephone company's gross receipts as defined herein for the city for the first calendar month following the local sales tax effective date compared to the last month prior to such effective date. This adjustment to the charge will be made on the first day of the second month following the local sales tax effective date and the adjusted charge shall be prorated from that date through the remainder of the payment year. The charge as adjusted shall be used for all future calculations required by this ordinance. 
Section 13. - Assignment of ordinance. 
    This ordinance and any rights or privileges hereunder shall not be assignable to any other entity without the express consent of the city. Such consent shall be evidenced by an ordinance which shall fully recite the terms and conditions, if any, upon which such consent is given. 
Section 14. - Mutual releases. 
    The city hereby fully releases, discharges, settles and compromises any and all claims which the city has made or could have made arising out of or connected with Ordinance Number 4, adopted November 9, 1953, and renewed or extended, from time to time thereafter, and its predecessor ordinances, if any, (hereinafter "Ordinance Number 4").

It is the intent of the city and the telephone company to enter into the foregoing mutual releases in order to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both the city and the telephone company. This ordinance and the mutual releases set forth in this section represent a compromise of each party's claims as well as each party's defenses, and is not intended to be and is not an admission of liability or vulnerability by either party to the other with respect to either the claims or the defenses asserted against the other. Neither, the obligation, if any, of the telephone company to indemnify the city against third party claims for death, personal injuries, or property damage under Ordinance Number 4, nor claims or causes of action for property damage by the city against the telephone company, are hereby waived or released. 
Section 15. - Repeal of conflicting ordinances and agreements. 
    Ordinance Number 4, adopted November 9, 1953, is hereby repealed; provided, however, such repeal shall take effect at 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the effective date specified in the section of this ordinance entitled "Acceptance of Agreement and Effective Date."

Section 17. - Governing law. 
(a)  This ordinance shall be construed in accordance with the city Charter and city code(s) in effect on the date of passage of this ordinance to the extent that such Charter and code(s) are not in conflict with or in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States or the State of Texas.

Section 1. - Grant of authority. 
    The Town of Addison, Texas, hereinafter called "City," hereby grants to TXU Gas Distribution, a division of TXU Gas Company, hereinafter called "Company," a non-exclusive consent to use and occupy the present and future public streets, public alleys, public highways, and public thoroughfares of the City, hereinafter referred to as "Public Rights-of-Way," for the purpose of laying, maintaining, constructing, protecting, operating, and replacing therein and thereon pipelines and all other appurtenant equipment (the "System") to deliver, transport, and distribute natural gas in, out of, and through the City for persons, firms, and corporations, including all the general public, and to sell natural gas (hereinafter, "gas" means "natural gas") to persons, firms, and corporations, including all the general public, within the City corporate limits, as such limits may be amended from time to time during the term of this franchise, said consent being granted for a term ending December 31, 2023. This consent or grant does not grant to the Company the right, privilege or authority to engage in any other business within the City other than the provision of gas sales, transportation, distribution and the furnishing of gas to the City and its residents ("residents" meaning all persons, businesses, industry, governmental agencies, and any other entity whatsoever, located, in whole or part, within the City that are or may be served by the Company hereunder). 
Section 2. - Construction, maintenance, operation and relocation of company facilities. 
    Company shall lay, maintain, repair, construct, operate, and replace its System to minimize interference with traffic, other property, trees and other vegetation and landscaping, and improvements, shall perform work in a timely and expeditious manner, and shall promptly clean up and restore to approximate original condition all Public Rights-of-Way that it may disturb to the satisfaction of the City consistent with applicable ordinances, rules, regulations, and standards of the City to the extent that such do not conflict with state law. In determining the location of the facilities of the City and other utility franchisees within City, the City will have first priority to location, but to the extent reasonable and practicable, in the City's sole determination, it will endeavor to minimize any significant interference with then existing facilities of Company. In the event of a conflict between the location of the facilities of Company and the location of the facilities of City or other utility franchisees within Public Rights-of-Way that cannot otherwise be resolved, City or an authorized agent of City shall resolve the conflict and determine the location of the respective facilities. Company shall be required to obtain street cutting, street excavation or other special permits related to excavations in Public Rights-of-Way in connection with Company's operations in Public Rights-of-Way in accordance with the ordinances, rules and regulations of the City (including, without limitation, Chapter 60, article III and IV, of the City's Code of Ordinances), however, in no event shall the Company be required to pay permitting fees or bonds, so long as they remain a regulated gas distribution company by the Texas Railroad Commission or any successor entity. 
    The construction, placement, replacement, expansion, excavation, repair, maintenance, use and operation of Company's System used in connection with the provision of gas hereunder, and the operation of the business of the Company, shall be consistent and in compliance with this franchise, the ordinances, regulations and rules of the City as now existing or as they may be added to, repealed, supplemented, amended or revised (including, without limitation, Chapter 70, articles III and IV, Town of Addison Code of Ordinances) to the extent that such do not conflict with all applicable laws, regulations, and rules, whether federal, state or local. This franchise agreement shall in no way affect or impair the rights, obligations or remedies of the parties under the Texas Utilities Code, or other state or federal law. Nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver, release or relinquishment of either party's right to contest or appeal any action or decision of the other party, including ordinances adopted by the City, that it believes is contrary to any federal, state or local law or regulation. 
    The City reserves the right to change the grade of, construct, install, repair, alter, maintain, relocate, modify, close, reduce, or widen (together, "change") any Public Right-of-Way, within the present or future limits of the City, and at the City's request the Company shall at the Company's own cost and expense relocate or remove its pipelines, equipment, mains, laterals, and other facilities in order to accommodate such change of any Public Right-of-Way. When the Company is required by City to remove or relocate its pipelines, equipment, mains, laterals, and/or other facilities to accommodate such change of any Public Right-of-Way, and Company is eligible under federal, state, county, local or other programs for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by Company as a result of such removal or relocation, and such reimbursement is required to be handled through the City, Company costs and expenses shall be included in any application by the City for reimbursement, if Company submits its cost and expense documentation to the City prior to the filing of the application. City shall provide reasonable notice to Company of the deadline for Company to submit documentation of the costs and expenses of such relocation to City. If the Company is required by the City to remove or relocate its System for any reason other than such change of or to any Public Right-of-Way, Company shall be entitled to reimbursement from the City or others of the cost and expense of such removal or relocation. When Company is required to remove or relocate its pipelines, equipment, mains, laterals and/or other facilities to accommodate such change of any Public Right-of-Way by City without reimbursement from City, Company shall have the right to seek a surcharge to recover relocation costs pursuant to Section 104.112 et al, of the Texas Utilities Code (provided such law (or any successor law thereto) is in effect at the time the City requires such removal or relocation). 
    Upon request of the City, Company shall remove and abate any portion of its gas System or any equipment or facility that is dangerous to life or property, and in case Company, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the City may remove or abate the same, at the sole cost and expense of Company, all without compensation or liability for damages to Company. Company shall be given adequate notice and opportunity to remove or abate. City may not take action to remove or abate without providing the Company at least five (5) business day's notice of intent to act to remove or abate Company's facilities. 
    If City abandons any Public Right-of-Way in which Company has facilities, such abandonment shall be conditioned on Company's right to maintain its use of the former Public Right-of-Way and on the obligation of the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned to reimburse Company for all removal or relocation expenses if Company agrees to the removal or relocation of its facilities following abandonment of the Public Right-of-Way. If the party to whom the Public Right-of-Way is abandoned requests the Company to remove or relocate its facilities and Company agrees to such removal or relocation, such removal or relocation shall be done within a reasonable time at the expense of the party requesting the removal or relocation. If relocation cannot practically be made to another Public Right-of-Way, the expense of any right-of-way acquisition shall be considered a relocation expense to be reimbursed by the party requesting the relocation. 
    Company shall install, repair, maintain and replace its pipelines, equipment and other facilities in a good and workmanlike manner. 
Section 3. - Indemnity and insurance. 
(A)  In the event of injury to any person or damage to any property by reason of Company's construction, operation, maintenance or replacement of Company's pipeline System within Public Rights-of-Way, Company shall indemnify, defend and keep harmless the City, its officers, employees and agents, from any and all liability in connection therewith, except to the extent such injury or damage is attributable to the fault of the City, including without limitation, the City's negligent or intentional actions or omissions. 
(B)  Company may self-insure to the extent permitted by applicable law under any plan of self-insurance, maintained in accordance with sound accounting practices, against risks and obligations undertaken pursuant to this franchise and shall not be required to maintain insurance; provided that Company furnishes the City satisfactory evidence of the existence of an insurance reserve adequate for the risks covered by such plan of self-insurance. Company shall provide the City with evidence of the form and basis for insurance coverage or self-insurance, as applicable, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this franchise ordinance. Provided however that the Company's self-insurance shall provide to the City, its officers, employees and agents, with the same defense as would be provided by an insurance carrier and with substantially the same coverage as required by other users of the Public Right-of-Way in the City. Should Company elect to change the form or basis of insurance during the term of this franchise, Company shall notify the City. Company shall provide documentation necessary for review by the City of the changed circumstances of Company. 
Section 4. - Extensions for residential customers. 
    At an individual residential customer's request, Company shall be required to extend distribution mains for such customer in any Public Rights-of-Way up to one hundred feet (100') for any one residential customer only if such customer, at a minimum, uses gas for unsupplemented space heating and water heating. Company shall not be required to extend transmission mains in any Public Rights-of-Way within City or to make a tap on any transmission main within City unless Company agrees to such extension or tap by a written agreement between Company and a customer. Upon final approval of the Line Extension Policy filed by TXU Gas in it's Tariff for Gas Service, filed as part of its systemwide rate case (Gas Utilities Docket No. 9400), the provisions of Section 4 will terminate and line extensions will be in accordance with the approved Tariff.

If the City does not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing sums of money shall be in lieu of taxes, licenses, fees, street or alley rentals or charges, easement or franchise taxes or charges aforesaid, then City agrees that it will apply so much of said sums of money paid as may be necessary to satisfy Company's obligations, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses, charges, fees, rentals, easement or franchise taxes or charges aforesaid. 
D.  Effect of Other Municipal Franchise Ordinance Fees Accepted and Paid by Company. 
(1)  If Company should at any time after the effective date of this Ordinance agree to new municipal franchise ordinance, or renew an existing municipal franchise ordinance, with another municipality, which municipal franchise ordinance determines the franchise fee owed to that municipality for the use of its public rights-of-way in a manner that, if applied to the City, would result in a franchise fee greater than the amount otherwise due City under this Ordinance, then the franchise fee to be paid by Company to City pursuant to this Ordinance shall be increased so that the amount due and to be paid is equal to the amount that would be due and payable to City were the franchise fee provisions of that other franchise ordinance applied to City. 
(2)  The provisions of this Subsection D apply only to the amount of the franchise fee to be paid and do not apply to other franchise fee payment provisions, including without limitation the timing of such payments.

This authority to Lease Facilities within City's Rights-of-Way shall not affect any such lessee, licensee or user's obligation, if any, to pay franchise fees and to obtain consent of the City to use the Public Rights-of-Way by franchise or as otherwise may be required by law. 
G.  Company agrees that on the same date that payments are made, as provided in this Section 6, it will file with the City Secretary a report showing the gross revenues as defined in this Section 6 received by the Company during the calendar quarter or year, as applicable, upon which the payment is based in sufficient detail to reasonably verify payments. City may, if it sees fit, have the books and records of Company examined by a representative of City to ascertain the correctness of the reports agreed to be filed herein, and Company shall fully cooperate in making available its records and otherwise assisting in these activities. Should any payment due date required by this franchise fall on a weekend or declared bank holiday, payment shall be delivered to the City no later than the close of business of the last working day prior to any specifically required due date contained within this franchise.

(ii)  if such failure cannot with due diligence be cured within the said thirty (30) day period, then cure such failure within an additional reasonable period of time so long as the Company has submitted to the City in writing its plan (including, without limitation, the time period) to cure such failure and has commenced curative action within the said thirty (30) day period, and thereafter is diligently attempting to cure the failure; or 
(iii)  if the Company reasonably believes that the failure specified in the notice from the City is not a failure of a material provision of this Ordinance, submit to the City within ten (10) days after its receipt of the notice the Company's written response specifying facts and presenting arguments in refutation or defense of such alleged failure (the "Company's Defense"). 
In the event that the Company does not comply with subparagraphs (i), (ii), or (iii) above, or if the Company does comply with subparagraph (iii) above but the City, after its review of the Company's Defense, nevertheless believes that the Company has failed to comply with a material provision of this Ordinance, the City shall be entitled to compel compliance by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction and seek such other remedies as may be available to the City, and if, upon final judgment, not subject to further appeal, being entered in favor of the City, the Company remains in default of any material provision of this Ordinance or the final judgment, the City may declare this Ordinance to be terminated. 
Section 13. - Paragraph headings, construction. 
    The paragraph headings contained in this ordinance are for convenience only and shall in no way enlarge or limit the scope or meaning of the various and several paragraphs hereof. Both parties have participated in the preparation of this ordinance and this ordinance shall not be construed either more or less strongly against or for either party.

Company shall provide notice of any assignment, transfer, pledge or conveyance to an affiliated entity at the same time it provides written notice to the Texas Railroad Commission. Any assignment, transfer, pledge or other conveyance, whether to an affiliated entity or otherwise, shall require the assignee or transferee to perform all of the terms and conditions of this franchise. 
Section 15. - Compliance with City Charter.

Any request by Company for a modification to this Franchise shall be subject to a review by the City Attorney for compliance with the applicable provisions of the City Charter. 
Section 16. - Third parties. 
    Nothing contained in this franchise shall be construed to provide rights to third parties. 
Section 17. - Severability. 
    This Ordinance, and every provision hereof, shall be considered severable, and the invalidity or unconstitutionality of any section, clause, provision or portion of this Ordinance shall not affect the validity or constitutionality of any other portion of this Ordinance. 
Section 18. - Effective date. 
    If Company accepts this ordinance, by the filing of its written acceptance with the City Secretary, this ordinance shall become effective on date of final passage. If written acceptance of this franchise ordinance is not filed by Company after its final passage and approval by said City within sixty (60) days, the franchise ordinance shall be rendered null and void.
