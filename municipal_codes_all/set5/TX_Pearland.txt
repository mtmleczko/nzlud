PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Pearland, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1999 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and Becky Moore, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Young Lorfing, City Secretary, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing sections or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _______ to _______" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and

Each day any violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. In the event that any such violation is designated as a nuisance under the provisions of this Code, such nuisance may be summarily abated by the police department of the city.

Sec. 1-13. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable; and, if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code since the same would have been enacted by the city council without the incorporation in this Code of any such unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.

    The department shall keep a permanent record of all kennel licenses issued pursuant to this article, and such record shall show the name of the person, firm or corporation to which such license is issued, the name and address of the kennel, the date issued and fees paid therefor. 
(Ord. No. 528-8, § 1, 11-11-13) 
Sec. 6-75. - Suspension of license; hearing. 
(a)  Grounds for suspension. The department may suspend any kennel license if any of the following conditions exist at the kennel: 
(1)  Animals at the kennel are being deprived of necessary food, care or shelter; 
(2)  Animals at the kennel are being cruelly confined or are otherwise being cruelly treated; or 
(3)  Unsanitary conditions exist at the kennel to such an extent that those conditions create a possible medium for the transmission of disease to the animals kept there or to human beings. 
Such a suspension is effective upon service of notice as set out below. Whenever a kennel license is suspended no animal shall be accepted or placed in the kennel and all animals at the kennel on the date the license is suspended shall be removed therefrom as soon as possible, but in no event shall any animal remain in the kennel more than ten (10) days after the date the license was suspended unless it has been reinstated prior to that time. 
(b)  Written notice of suspension; hearing. Whenever a license is suspended, written notice shall be given to the licensee, the person in charge of the kennel or any employee or agent of the licensee. 
(1)  Contents of notice. Such notice shall set forth: 
a.  The specific conditions existing at the kennel which are grounds for suspension of the license pursuant to subsection (a) above; 
b.  That a hearing will be held before the city manager or his designate; 
c.  The date, time and place of such hearing; and 
d.  That the licensee may appear in person and/or be represented by counsel and may present testimony and cross-examine all witnesses. 
(2)  Conduct of hearing: 
a.  Such hearing shall be held not later than seven (7) days after the date the license is suspended. 
b.  The following rules shall apply to such hearing: 
1.  All parties shall have the right to representation by a licensed attorney though an attorney is not required; 
2.  Each party may present witnesses in his own behalf; 
3.  Each party has the right to cross-examine all witnesses; and 
4.  Only evidence presented before the hearing officer at such hearing may be considered in rendering the order. 
(3)  Failure to appear. If the licensee fails to appear at the hearing at the time, place and date specified, the city shall present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case showing that conditions exist at the kennel which are grounds for suspension of the license pursuant to subsection (a) above. 
(c)  Findings of hearing officer. If the hearing officer finds conditions which were stated in the notice for grounds for suspension of the license pursuant to subsection (b) above in fact do exist at the kennel, the hearing officer shall order the license suspended. Provided, however, if the hearing officer finds that the needs of the animals and of public interest will be adequately protected by a warning, he may reinstate the license. 
If the hearing officer finds that on the date of the hearing no conditions exist at the kennel which were set out in the notice as grounds for suspension of the license, he shall order such license reinstated. However, reinstatement of such license shall not preclude the city from seeking revocation of the license as set out below. 
A copy of the findings and order of the hearing officer shall be served on the licensee, or if the address of the licensee is unknown or the notice has been sent certified mail, return receipt requested, and has been returned undelivered, such notice shall be served on the person in charge of the kennel or on any employee or agent of the licensee. 
(d)  Correction of conditions; inspection; reinstatement of license. Whenever the reason for a suspension no longer exists, the licensee or person in charge of the kennel shall notify the department that the conditions under which the license was suspended have been corrected and that an inspection is requested. Such inspection shall be conducted as soon as possible after receiving the request and in no event shall be later than three (3) regular working days after the receipt of the request for an inspection. If such inspection shows that the conditions were in fact corrected, the license shall be reinstated unless the city has given notice that it is seeking revocation of the license. 
(e)  Conditions for revocation. A license to operate a kennel may be revoked if: 
(1)  Animals at the kennel are being deprived of necessary food, care or shelter; or 
(2)  Animals at the kennel are being cruelly treated; or 
(3)  Unsanitary conditions exist at the kennel to such an extent that those conditions create a possible medium for the transmission of the disease to the animals kept at the kennel or to human beings; and, 
(4)  Conditions stated in subsection (e)(2) and/or (e)(3) above have existed on two (2) or more occasions at the kennel after the kennel has been warned of such conditions by officials of the health department; or 
(5)  There have been two (2) or more suspensions of the kennel license and conditions which were grounds for such suspensions did in fact exist at the time of the suspension; or 
(6)  The licensee is shown to have previously committed any offense involving cruelty to animals; or 
(7)  The licensee has knowingly employed any person at the kennel or allowed any person to work at the kennel who has been previously convicted of any offense involving cruelty to animals. 
(f)  Written notice of grounds for revocation. Prior to revocation, written notice shall be given to the licensee or person in charge. Such notice shall set forth: 
(1)  The grounds upon which the city will seek revocation of the license; 
(2)  The specific conditions upon which the city will rely in seeking revocation of the license; 
(3)  That a hearing will be held before the city manager or his designate; 
(4)  The date, time and place of such hearing; 
(5)  That the licensee may appear in person and/or be represented by counsel may present testimony and may cross-examine all witnesses. 
Such hearings shall be held in accordance with subsection (b) above. If the licensee fails to appear at the hearing at the time, place and date specified, the city shall present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case showing that grounds in fact do exist for the revocation of the license. 
(g)  Findings of hearing officer. After completion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall make findings as to whether or not grounds exist for revocation of the license. If the hearing officer finds that grounds do exist for revocation of the license, he shall revoke such; provided, however, if the city sought revocation for reasons under subsections (e)(1), (2) and/or (3) above and no grounds exist for revocation under [subsections] (e)(4), (5), (6) or (7) above, the hearing officer may deny the request for revocation if he finds that the needs of the animals and the public interest will be adequately protected by a warning. 
A copy of the written findings shall be served on the licensee. If the address of the licensee is unknown or if such findings have been sent certified mail, return receipt requested, and returned undelivered, such findings shall be served on the person in charge of the kennel or on an agent or employee of the licensee. 
(h)  Removal of animals upon revocation of license. If the license is revoked, no animal shall be accepted or placed in the kennel and all animals at the kennel on the date the license is revoked shall be removed therefrom as soon as possible, but in no case no later than ten (10) days after notice that the license has been revoked was served on the licensee, his agent or his employee. 
(i)  Service of notices. Any notice provided for in this section may be served by personal delivery or by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(j)  Nonrefundability of license fee; reinstatement of license. In the event a license is revoked, the city shall not be liable to the licensee for any refund of any part of the license fee. Reinstatement of a license that has been revoked shall require application and payment of a permit fee as if it were an initial application; provided, however, no license shall be issued to the same licensee if the licensee has been convicted of any offense involving cruelty to animals; no license shall be issued to the same licensee within one (1) year of the date a license has been revoked; and no license shall be issued for the same location unless it is shown that adequate precautions have been taken so that the conditions under which the license was revoked shall not recur. If there is a dispute between the animal control officer and a person applying for a license for a place for which a license was revoked as to whether adequate precautions have been taken so that the conditions under which the license was revoked will not recur, the applicant may request a hearing before the city manager or his designate. Such hearing shall be conducted under the same procedures as a hearing for a revocation of a license; however the burden shall be on the applicant to show that adequate precautions have been taken so that the conditions under which the license was revoked will not reoccur.

(Ord. No. 606, § 1, 3-25-91) 
Sec. 10-100. - Storage and handling of materials that are hazardous in contact with water. 
    Metals and compounds that react vigorously with water include lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, rubidium, cesium, and the alloys and amalgams of these metals; phosphides, sulfides, borides, nitrides, selenides, arsenides, carbides, silicides, hydrides, acid anhydrides, and concentrated acids or alkalies. 
    These substances react strongly with water, steam or water solutions to produce heat and flammable or explosive gases. Some materials, such as the alkali metals and metal hydrides, undergo a vigorous exothermic reaction with water, evolving hydrogen, which may be ignited spontaneously by the heat of reaction. The alkali metals also react strongly with all common extinguishing agents. 
    The acid anhydrides, concentrated acids, and alkalies will react to produce considerable heat. Other compounds react with water or decompose when heated to produce flammable gases or explosive hydrides. In many cases, these gases are extremely toxic. The volatile hydrides, including those of boron, phosphorous, and arsenic, will ignite spontaneously in air. 
(1)  Materials that are hazardous in contact with water shall be stored and handled in buildings of fire-resistive or damage limiting construction, safely protected from floods and windstorm damage. 
(2)  Complete sprinkler protection shall be provided if ordinary combustibles are present or if construction is combustible. Sprinkler water does not increase the hazard of an explosion because flammable gases released by reaction with water would ignite immediately. The sprinkler discharge would protect the building, prevent ignition beyond the immediate burning zone, and ultimately distinguish or control the fire. 
(3)  Buildings having these materials shall be dry, cool and well ventilated. The may be heated indirectly by dry hot air systems. Avoid the use of steam heating systems. Buildings shall be designed as for hydrogen storage, with approved powered roof vents to remove light gases promptly. 
(4)  Automatic detection and alarm systems to warn of dangerous accumulations of flammable gases may be required by the fire marshal where sufficient hazards exist. 
(5)  The materials shall usually be stored in airtight sealed containers and handled in dry boxes containing an inert gas atmosphere.

Standard No. 704m. Where more than one (1) hazardous chemical is stored in a given cabinet, then list the most dangerous first, followed by the remaining chemicals. 
(Ord. No. 606, § 1, 3-25-91) 
Sec. 10-102. - Transporting hazardous materials. 
(a)  No person shall operate any vehicle transporting any hazardous materials unless, at the time of such transportation, there is displayed upon each side and the rear of the vehicle, a sign in letters not less than three (3) inches in height upon a background of sharply contrasting color, which shall specifically designate the cargo. Emergency information such as emergency telephone numbers along with the appropriate symbol(s) according to N.F.P.A. Standard No. 704m shall be displayed in an approved manner. 
(b)  A "Hazardous Materials Route" for the sole purpose of transporting any and all hazardous materials is hereby designated and shall include the following: State Highway 35 (Main Street), State Highway 288 (Nolan Ryan Expressway), Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Parkway), and the BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) rail line. No person shall cause any vehicle transporting hazardous materials to travel any routes other than the ones established herein, except as follows: 
(1)  Vehicles delivering or picking up hazardous materials to or from commercial and industrial complexes may travel the nearest and most direct public roadway to said complex. 
(2)  Vehicles containing hazardous materials that are operated by local businesses, may travel the nearest and most direct public roadway to said place of business. 
(c)  Vehicle parking. Except in an emergency, no vehicle transporting hazardous materials shall be left unattended on any street, highway, alley or parking lot; provided, that this shall not prevent the driver or operator from the necessary absence from said vehicle in connection with the delivery or pick up of load, except that during actual discharge of said hazardous materials, some responsible person shall be present at said vehicle; nor shall it prevent stops for meals during the day or night; provided, that said vehicle be parked in a safe manner; nor shall it prevent said vehicle from being parked for any reason at an area approved by the fire marshal.

Sec. 10-103. - Handling of emergency conditions; fire protection and prevention measures generally. 
(a)  Provisions shall be made in all storage areas for hazardous materials, for the proper handling of emergency conditions such as leaks, spills and ruptures. Employees shall be instructed on proper procedures for notifying emergency services, appropriate emergency action, if any; and appropriate evacuation procedures. 
(b)  Where open flame constitutes a hazard, the fire marshal may restrict smoking and require posting of "No Smoking" signs. 
(c)  Portable fire extinguishers shall be provided in accordance with special care to any reactivity between chemicals stored and extinguisher agent selected. 
(d)  Large fire suppression systems or devices may be required where determined by the fire marshal. 
(e)  A conspicuous placard shall be permanently displayed beginning with the words, "In Case of Fire"; such placard shall designate the fire department phone number and such other safety precautions the fire marshal deems necessary. 
(f)  Means shall be available for calling the fire department. Such means may consist of a proprietary alarm system, fire department alarm box or telephone not requiring a coin to operate; whichever it is, it must be within one hundred (100) feet of the storage or manufacturing area. 
(Ord. No. 606, § 1, 3-25-91) 
Sec. 10-104. - Disposition of hazardous materials incidents.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 532-6 , § 1(Exh. A), adopted Dec. 19, 2016, repealed the former ch. 101/2, §§ 101/2-1-101/2-13, 101/2-24-101/2-27, 101/2-38-101/2-42, 101/2-51-101/2-66, 101/2-71, and enacted a new ch. 101/2 as set out herein. The former ch. 101/2 pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

Sec. 101/2-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water Code, Section 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of the City of Pearland, Texas does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 532-6 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-16) 
Sec. 101/2-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 532-6 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-16) 
Sec. 101/2-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(8)  Regulate all fill in the floodplain to ensure that all placed in the floodplain is mitigated by compensating cut material that is removed from the floodplain so that no increase of flood levels well result. 
(Ord. No. 532-6 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-16) 
Sec. 101/2-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(6)  Ensure that all fill in the floodplain is mitigated by compensating cut in the floodplain.

(c)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the building board of adjustment and appeals may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 101/2-53(b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the building board of adjustment and appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (sections 101/2-3 and 101/2-4). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in subsections 101/2-54(a)-(h) are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(Ord. No. 532-6 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-16) 
Sec. 101/2-84. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 101/2-32, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 101/2-53 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 532-6 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-16) 
Sec. 101/2-85. - Floodways. 
    Floodways-Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 101/2-32, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection 101/2-85(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article V. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulation, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 532-6 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-16)

Sec. 20-81. - Finding and intent. 
    The foregoing recitals are hereby found to be true and correct and are hereby adopted by the city council and made a part hereof for all purposes as findings of fact. Further, the city council finds that sex offenders that use physical violence and who are convicted of preying on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the health, safety and welfare of children. Sex offenders are likely to use physical violence, to repeat an offense, have many more victims than are ever reported, are prosecuted for only a fraction of their actual sexual offenses, and children not only lack the ability to protect themselves but additional measures should be taken to keep known sex offenders from having access to children in areas where children generally feel safe. 
    It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain registered sex offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residency. 
(Ord. No. 1267, § 1, 5-18-06)

    Permanent residence means a place where the person abides, lodges or resides for fourteen (14) or more consecutive days. 
    Property owner means any owner of record, person who has contractual responsibility for the property, or person who has the legal right of possession of the property.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption in prosecutions under this chapter that the person listed on the account for utility services furnished by the city is the person who has the legal right of possession of the property. 
    Temporary residence means a place where the person abides, lodges or resides for a period of fourteen (14) or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the person's permanent address, or a place where the person routinely abides, resides or lodges for a period of four (4) or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not the person's permanent residence.

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1322-1, § 1, adopted Oct. 26, 2009, amended Art. VI in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. VI, §§ 20-91-20-97, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 1322, § 1, adopted April 9, 2007. 

Sec. 20-91. - Finding and intent. 
    The city council hereby finds the following recitals to be true and correct and adopts them for all purposes as findings of fact: 
    The creation of graffiti is a criminal act prohibited by state laws in the Penal Code. Although the person who has had graffiti applied on his/her property may be the victim of a criminal act, unless the city acts to cause the removal of graffiti, it tends to remain and causes other properties and entire neighborhoods to be affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city and the public welfare. 
    Graffiti is an impure and unwholesome matter and its existence is detrimental to the safety and welfare of the public; tends to reduce the value of private property; invites vandalism, additional graffiti, and other criminal activities; and, produces urban blight which is adverse to the maintenance and continuing development of the city. Graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. 
    It is the intent of this ordinance to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by providing an additional enforcement tool to protect public and private property from additional acts of graffiti, vandalism and other criminal activities. 
(Ord. No. 1322-1, § 1, 10-26-09)

"Graffiti" does not include any of the foregoing that is placed on the property in compliance with any applicable city ordinance, state or federal law. 
    Owner. Any owner of record, person who has contractual responsibility for the property, or person who has the legal right of possession of the property. There shall be a rebuttable presumption in prosecutions under this article that the person who is listed on the tax records for the county wherein the property is situated is the owner. There shall be a rebuttable presumption in prosecutions under this article that the person currently named on the account for utility services furnished by the City of Pearland is the person who has the legal right of possession of the property. 
    Unauthorized. Without the consent of the owner or without authority of law. Unless the owner proves otherwise, lack of consent will be presumed under circumstances tending to show (i) the absence of evidence of specific authorization by the owner, (ii) that the visual blight is inconsistent with the design and the use of the subject property, or (iii) that the person causing the visual blight was unknown to the owner.

(b)  Prior to any enforcement or removal efforts by the city, the property owner shall be informed in writing that the city, at its sole expense, shall remove the graffiti from the owner's property, provided the property owner gives written permission for removal of the graffiti and releases the city, its contractors, and/or volunteer personnel from liability in the performance of the graffiti removal by completing a permission and release from liability form. 
(c)  If the property owner gives written permission for the city to remove the graffiti, the city shall remove the graffiti at its sole expense. 
(d)  If the city provides notice in accordance with this article and the United States Postal Service returns the notice as "refused" or "unclaimed," or the property owner fails to respond to the city's offer on or before the 15 th day after of the date the property owner receives notice of the city's offer, the property owner shall be deemed to have declined the city's offer.

By acceptance of the permit, the permit holder agrees to abide by the terms of this ordinance in all its operations within the city, including all operations and facilities and transmission media used in whole or in part in the provision of access lines in any newly annexed areas as specified in subsection 281/2-25(3) of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 858, § 3, 8-24-98)

(1)  No rights agreed to in this chapter by the city shall be exclusive and the city reserves the right to grant franchises, licenses, easements or permissions to use the rights-of-way within the city to any person as the city, in its sole discretion, may determine to be in the public interest.

(Ord. No. 858, § 4, 8-24-98) 
Sec. 281/2-25. - Compensation. 
(1)  Rights-of-way fee. The permit holder shall pay to the city a rights-of-way fee that is calculated as of month-end by applying the appropriate line fee to each access line owned, placed, or maintained by permit holder that is activated for use by an end-user or for another telecommunications service provider that uses permit holder's services or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service within the city. The line fee to be applied to each access line on a monthly basis shall be: 
Access Line Monthly Fee Per 
Access Line Residential $1.00 Nonresidential  2.00  
(2)  Number of access lines. Subject to city's agreement not to disclose this information, each permit holder must provide annually, within a reasonable time after receipt of the city's written request, a report showing the number of each type of access line owned or placed and maintained by permit holder within the city that are activated for end-user customers and other telecommunications service providers at month's end for each of the preceding twelve (12) months. The city agrees that the report shall be used solely for the purpose of verifying the number of the permit holder's access lines within the city that are activated for end-user customers and telecommunications service providers. Upon written request, the permit holder shall verify the information in the report and, upon reasonable advance notice, produce to the city and permit inspection by the city of all noncustomer-specific records and documents reasonably calculated to verify the information. For purposes of payment of fees for use of the rights-of-way, lines terminating at customer's premises that are billed as "Lifeline," "TelAssistance," or other service that is required to be similarly discounted pursuant to state or federal law or regulation for the purpose of advancing universal service to the economically disadvantaged shall not be included in the lines upon which the fee is calculated. 
(3)  Annexation and disannexation. Within thirty (30) days following the date of the passage of any action effecting the annexation of any property to or the disannexation of any property from the city's corporate boundaries, the city agrees to furnish permit holder written notice of the action and an accurate map of the city's corporate boundaries showing, if available, street names and number details. For the purpose of compensating the city under this chapter, a permit holder shall start including or excluding access lines within the affected area in the permit holder's count of access lines on the effective date designated by the state comptroller of public accounts for the imposition of state local sales and use taxes; but in no case less than thirty (30) days from the date the permit holder is notified by the city of the annexation or disannexation. 
(4)  Confidential records. If the permit holder notifies the city of the confidential nature of any information, reports, documents, or writings, the city agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the information, reports, documents, and writings to the extent permitted by law. Upon receipt by the city of requests for the permit holder's confidential information, reports, documents, or writings, the city shall notify the permit holder of the request in writing by facsimile transmission. The city shall request an attorney general's opinion before disclosing any confidential information, reports, documents or writings and will furnish the permit holder with copies of attorney general opinion requests it makes pertaining to the permit holder's confidential information, reports, documents or writings. 
(5)  No other fees. The payments due hereunder shall be in lieu of any permit, license, approval, inspection, or other similar fees or charges, including, but not limited to, all general business license fees customarily assessed by the city for the use of the rights-of-way against persons operating businesses similar to that of the permit holder. Further, such rights-of-way fee shall constitute full compensation to the city for all of permit holder's facilities located within the rights-of-way, including interoffice-transport and other transmission media that do not terminate at an end-user customer's network interface device, even though those types of lines are not used in the calculation of the rights-of-way fee. 
(6)  Timing of payment. Permit holder shall remit the line fee on a quarterly basis. The payment shall be due on the forty-fifth day following the close of each calendar quarter for which the payment is calculated. 
(7)  Uncollectibles. City and permit holder understand and agree that permit holder has a statutory right to pass through to its customers on a pro rata basis any compensation paid to the city for access to the rights-of-way. Any other provision of this chapter notwithstanding, permit holder shall not be obligated to pay the city for any access lines for which revenues remain uncollectible. 
(8)  Facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers. To the extent allowed by applicable state and federal law, any telecommunications service providers that purchase unbundled network elements or other facilities for the purpose of rebundling those facilities to create telecommunications service for sale to persons within the city shall pay to the city a rights-of-way fee that is calculated as of month-end by applying the appropriate line fee, as specified in subsection (1) above, to each access line created by rebundling services or facilities. Such direct payment to the city is necessary because it is only the person creating the services for resale that will be able to determine the number of access lines being provided, so that the rights-of-way fee imposed herein can be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis to all telecommunications service providers that sell telecommunications service within the city. Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, the permit holder shall not include in its monthly count of access lines any unbundled network elements or other facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers for rebundling into telecommunications services, if the telecommunications service provider that is rebundling those facilities for resale has provided a signed statement to the permit holder that the telecommunications service provider is paying the access line fees applicable to those rebundled services directly to the city. If permit holder provides a copy of the signed statement to the city, then permit holder is absolved of all responsibility for the line fees payable on the services, unbundled network facilities, and other facilities rebundled for the creation of telecommunications service for sale within the city. 
(9)  Fee application to leased facilities. Pursuant to V.T.C.A., Utilities Code § 54.206, a permit holder may collect the line fee imposed by the city pursuant to this chapter through a pro rata charge to the customers in the boundaries of the city, including any other persons who are leasing, reselling or otherwise using the permit holder's access lines to provide telecommunications service. With respect to any person leasing, reselling, or otherwise using a permit holder's access lines, if a permit holder believes it does not have sufficient information to determine the appropriate rate to apply, then the higher line fee shall apply until such time as the person using the access lines provides to the permit holder sufficient written information to determine the correct line fee. If a person provides sufficient written information for the application of the line fee, permit holders may bill the person on the basis of the information provided. Permit holder shall provide to the city any information regarding the locations to which it is providing service or facilities for use by another person for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers, so long as city first obtains written permission of such other person for permit holder to provide the information to the city. Any other provision of this chapter notwithstanding, however, a permit holder shall not be liable for underpayment of line fees resulting from the permit holder's reliance upon the written information provided by any person that uses permit holder's service or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers.

(4)  Upon request, the permit holder shall remove or raise or lower its aerial wires, fiber or cables temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures. The expense of such temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting them, and the permit holder may require payment in advance. The permit holder shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary rearrangements. 
(5)  The permit holder, its contractors and agents have the right, permission and license to trim trees upon and overhanging the rights-of-way to prevent trees from coming in contact with the permit holder's facilities and transmission media.

The notice by the city shall include a specification of the new location for the permit holder's facilities along the rights-of-way. 
(2)  The city retains the right to move any facilities within the rights-of-way to cure or otherwise address a public health or safety emergency. The city shall cooperate to the extent possible with the permit holder in such instances to assure continuity of service and to afford to the permit holder the opportunity to make such relocation itself. 
(Ord. No. 858, § 7, 8-24-98) 
Sec. 281/2-28. - Indemnification. 
    The permit holder shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from all costs, expenses, and damages to persons or property arising directly or indirectly from the construction, maintenance, repair, or operation of the permit holder's facilities located within the rights-of-way found to be caused solely by the negligence of the permit holder. Expenses shall include any reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and court costs. The city shall give the permit holder prompt written notice of any claim for which the city seeks indemnification. The permit holder shall have the right to investigate, defend and compromise any such claim. This provision is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties, but rather this provision is solely for the benefit of the permit holder and the city.

(1)  The city may, at any time, make reasonable inquiries pertaining to the terms, conditions, rights and obligations of this chapter, and the permit holder shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis.

Sec. 281/2-32. - Nondiscrimination and competitive neutrality.

    Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors "green, red and yellow" shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and such lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(a)  Green indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
(2)  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(3)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(b)  Steady yellow indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. 
(2)  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(c)  Steady red indication: 
(1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. 
(2)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
    In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, V.T.C.A., Transportation Code §§ 544.007, 552.002.

    Whenever any ordinance of the city designates and describes a through street it shall be the duty of the city traffic engineer to place and maintain a stop sign, or on the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation at any intersection a yield sign, on each and every street intersecting such through street unless traffic at any such intersection is controlled at all times by traffic-control signals; provided, however, that at the intersection of two (2) such through streets or at the intersection of a through street and a heavy traffic street not so designated, stop signs shall be erected at the approaches of either of such streets as may be determined by the city traffic engineer upon the basis of an engineering and traffic study. 
Sec. 29-223. - Other intersections where stop or yield required. 
    The city traffic engineer is hereby authorized to determine and designate intersections where particular hazards exist upon other than through streets and to determine whether vehicles shall stop at one or more entrances to any such intersection, in which event he shall cause to be erected a stop sign at every such place where a stop is required, or whether vehicles shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles on a different street at such intersection as prescribed in subsection (a) of section 29-224, in which event he shall cause to be erected a yield sign at every place where obedience thereto is required.

    Except when directed to proceed by a police officer or traffic-control signal, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop intersection indicated by a stop sign shall stop as required by subsection (b) of section 29-224, and after having stopped shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway or which is approaching so closely on such highway as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such driver is moving across or within the intersection. 
Sec. 29-226. - Vehicle entering yield intersection. 
    The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall in obedience to such sign slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another highway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection; provided, however, that if such a driver is involved in a collision with a vehicle in the intersection, after driving past a yield sign without stopping, such collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his failure to yield the right-of-way. 
Sec. 29-227. - Emerging from alley, driveway or building. 
    The driver of a vehicle within a business or residence district emerging from an alley, driveway or building shall stop such vehicle immediately prior to driving onto a sidewalk or onto the sidewalk area extending across any alleyway or driveway, and shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian as may be necessary to avoid collision and upon entering the roadway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on the roadway. 
Sec. 29-228. - Stop when traffic obstructed. 
    No driver shall enter an intersection or a marked crosswalk unless there is sufficient space on the other side of the intersection or crosswalk to accommodate the vehicle he is operating without obstructing the passage of other vehicles or pedestrians, notwithstanding any traffic-control signal indication to proceed.

Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 1108-1, adopted Nov. 23, 2009, amended Art. III in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. III, §§ 291/2-21-291/2-30, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 1108, § 1, Exh. A, adopted July 28, 2003. See the Code Comparative Table for a complete derivation. 

Sec. 291/2-21. - Intent. 
    The intent of this article is to encourage site planning which furthers the preservation of trees and natural areas by these methods; to protect trees during construction; to facilitate site design and construction which contribute to the long-term viability of existing trees; and to control the unnecessary removal of trees; require on-site replacement of trees that must be removed and require off-site replacement of trees that cannot be replaced on-site, either by direct planting or through a "tree trust." It is the further intent of this article to achieve the following broader objectives: 
(1)  Protect healthy trees and preserve the natural ecological environmental and aesthetic qualities of the city. 
(2)  Protect and increase the value of residential and commercial properties within the city. 
(3)  Prohibit the indiscriminate clear cutting of property. 
(4)  Maintain and enhance a positive image for the attraction of new business enterprises to the city. 
(Ord. No. 1108-1, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 291/2-22. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this article, certain words or terms applicable hereto are defined as hereinafter provided. Words and terms used in this article, but not defined in this article shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the land use and urban development ordinance, landscape ordinance, or other ordinances in the city. Words and terms defined in two (2) ordinances shall be read in harmony unless there exists an irreconcilable conflict in which case the definition contained in this article shall control, including the building pad, driveway and pool, as shown on the building permit site plan. 
    Building pad: The actual foundation area of a building and a twelve-foot area around the foundation necessary for construction and grade transitions. 
    Circumference: Is measured four and one-half (41/2) feet above the ground using an ordinary tape measure or diameter tape. Measurement is taken just above or below any unusual swells in the trunk, as closely as possible to the four and one-half-foot level. For multiple-trunk trees, the trunk circumference is deemed to equal the circumference of the largest trunk plus half the circumference of each additional trunk. Measurements should be accurate to the nearest one-half-inch. 
    Criteria manual: The manual to be used and interpreted by city personnel in accordance with the tree protection and preservation ordinance (attached to Ord. No. 772 as attachment A and incorporated herein for all purposes), for the city's urban forest preservation and enhancement. 
    Critical root zone: The area within the drip line of the tree. As a practical matter, this is the acute portion of the tree's root system. Approximately ninety-nine (99) percent of the tree's root mass occurs within the top three (3) feet of the soil and most of the fine feeder roots which collect moisture and nutrients are located in the top four (4) inches of the soil. Typically, a tree's root system extends as much as two (2) to three (3) times the distance from the trunk to the drip line. 
    Damage or damaged: To "damage" a tree means to take any action which could result in a tree's death, either immediately or after a period of two (2) years. Some examples of such action, which are not intended to limit this definition, are as follows: severing the main trunk or large branches or roots, girdling, poisoning, carving, mutilating, touching with live wires, piercing with nails or spikes, crushing or exposing the roots, digging or drilling any hole larger than three (3) cubic feet (a trench) within the critical root zone, covering a substantial part of the critical root zone or compacting a substantial part of the soil in the critical root zone. 
    DBH (diameter breast height): The diameter of the tree measured four and one-half (41/2) feet above the ground using a diameter tape. 
    Drip line: An imaginary circle drawn around a tree, extending the same distance outward from the trunk to the trees branch limit. 
    Located: A tree is "located" within a given buildable area if any part of the trunk or critical root zone is within the buildable area at ground level. 
    Official: The city manager or his/her designee. 
    Park trees: Trees, shrubs, bushes, and all other woody vegetation in public parks having individual names and all areas owned by the city, or to which the public has free access as a park. 
    Planting: Standards of planting shall comply with the publication of the American National Standards Institute manual for Tree Care Operations ANSI A300 (Part 6). 
    Pruning: Standards of pruning shall comply with the publication of the American National Standards Institute manual for Tree Care Operations ANSI A300 (Part 1). 
    Qualified tree: Any tree listed in Class I or II of the Criteria Manual which has a trunk diameter of at least two (2) inches measured six (6) inches above ground. 
    Street trees: Trees, shrubs, bushes, and all other woody vegetation on land lying between the curb, pavement line and the property lines on either side of all streets, avenues, or ways within the city. 
    Temporary fencing: It shall be the duty of each person who applies for a building permit for construction or for any major development to provide temporary fencing in accordance with this article. The tree disposition plan shall specify protective fencing of the critical root zone whenever reasonably practicable, unless the tree disposition plan specifies otherwise: (a) a six-foot high fence must surround each protected tree or group of protected trees, effectively preventing persons, machinery, trash, material, and other items from occupying the area within the protective fencing, and (b) the fence may incorporate existing fences or walls as well as temporary fencing. A separate fence permit is not required for construction of a fence under this section, if a building permit for the work is in effect and a tree disposition plan has been approved. 
    Tree: A woody plant having one (1) well-defined stem or trunk, a defined crown and a mature height of at least eight (8) feet. Trees defined, protected and/or regulated by this article are classified as Class I and Class II trees as set forth in the criteria manual attached to Ord. No. 772. 
(1)  Large tree means a tree with a circumference of nineteen (19) inches or more. In case a tree is removed, it is presumed to have been a large tree if the diameter of the stump is six (6) inches or greater, measured in any direction. 
(2)  Multiple trunk tree means a tree with two (2) or more trunks visibly connected above the ground. 
(3)  Replacement tree means any tree meeting the minimum criteria for replacement trees as set out in the criteria manual. 
(4)  Significant tree means a tree with a circumference of thirty-six (36) inches or more. In case a tree is removed, it is presumed to have been a significant tree if the diameter of the stump is twelve (12) inches or greater, measured in any direction. 
(5)  Heritage tree means a significant tree located on a state designated historical site, within the Old Town Site, or within the floodplain. 
(6)  Protected tree means: 
a.  Any tree within: 
(i)  The front yard or front of the building site; 
(ii)  The side yard (of corner sites); 
(iii)  Right-of-way area. 
b.  Any significant tree within the city. 
c.  When there is a permit in effect for development or predevelopment activity on any subject site, "protected tree" includes all large trees located on that subject site.

    Tree survey: A tree survey is an on-the-ground survey containing the location of trees, their circumferences, types (species), and crown areas (drip line). The tree survey must depict for any given buildable area: (a) every large tree located in the buildable area, and (b) every large tree located elsewhere which has thirty (30) percent or more of its critical root zone in such buildable area. 
    Tree trust: A capital project fund created for the purpose of purchasing, growing, and/or maintaining trees and associated plants within the city limits. Said fund is to be expended in conformance with a tree propagation program drafted by the urban forester and approved by city council, annually. 
    Urban forester: A resource professional, charged with the responsibility of planning, establishing, protecting, and managing trees and associated plants, individually, in small groups, and under forest conditions within the city, with full authority to enforce the City's Code of Ordinances for violations of the same. 
    Visibility triangle: The area at a street corner lying within a triangle beginning at the precise intersection point of the curbs of each of the two (2) streets forming the corner and extending twenty (20) feet along each curb line away from the curb intersection point, with the third side being determined by drawing a straight line connecting the ends of such twenty-foot extensions. If there is no curb on such a street, the twenty-foot line shall follow the central flow line of the ditch paralleling the uncurbed street. The visibility triangle may include both public and private property.

Sec. 291/2-27. - Tree replacement requirements. 
    In the event that it is necessary to remove a tree which is located on the buildable site, the applicant, as a condition to issuance of a building permit, shall be required to replace the tree(s) being removed with quality trees as defined herein. This mitigative measure is not meant to supplant good site planning. 
(a)  A sufficient number and diameter of replacement trees shall be planted in order to equal the total diameter inches or fraction thereof of trees slated for removal. If this is not feasible, the permittee must either: (1) plant and maintain off-site replacement trees, subject to the provisions of the criteria manual; or (2) provide replacement trees by means of replacement inches obtained through a tree trust, as set forth in the criteria manual. 
Examples: 
1.  A total of eighteen-inch diameter to be removed shall be replaced with six (6) three-inch diameter trees. 
2.  A total of nineteen-inch diameter to be removed shall be replaced with seven (7) three-inch trees or five (5) three-inch trees and one (1) four-inch tree. 
(b)  Replacement trees shall meet the American Association of Nurserymen Standards. The minimum size of replacement tree is designated in the criteria manual (see criteria manual). 
(c)  Qualified trees under ordinance. To be a "qualified tree" under the ordinance, a tree must comply with the definition of "qualified tree" set out in this article. 
(d)  Standard of review. The city manager or his/her designee shall use reasonable best efforts to determine the type and number of replacement trees required in an attempt to minimize any burden resulting from this article. 
(e)  Replacement inch certificates. If a tree trust issues an effective "replacement inch" certificate to the city, the "replacement inches" described in the certificate are treated the same as trees actually planted as of the date of the certificate. To be effective, the "replacement inch" certificate must state unconditionally: 
(1)  The name of the applicant and the project to which the "replacement inches" apply; 
(2)  The tree trust will plant the specified "replacement inches" within reasonable proximity of the subject site, and within the city limits, on or before a specified planting date, which must fall within three hundred sixty-five (365) days following the date of the certificate; 
(3)  That the "replacement inches" will be planted and maintained in accordance with the provisions of this article and the criteria manual; and 
(4)  That all costs have been paid. A certificate may be conditioned so that it would only become effective if the applicant fails to plant other trees by the specified planting date. 
(f)  Replacement inch credits. An owner of a site in the city who plants a Class I or Class II tree on that site is eligible to receive credit for future "replacement inches." The owner may use the credit to offset the number of "replacement inches" assessed for protected trees removed from the same site at any time in the future. Credits are subject to the following: 
(1)  Issuance. Credits are only available for trees registered with the city within thirty (30) days following the day they are planted. Registration requires application and proof of planting. The registration form shall specify the size and species of each tree planted and its location on the site. 
(2)  Measurement. The number of replacement inches actually credited is determined by the city at the time an offset in request, based on the health and size of the previously-registered trees and apply the provisions of the criteria manual regarding calculation of replacement inches. 
(3)  Transferability. Credits are not transferable to another site but may be claimed by subsequent owners of the same site. 
(4)  Records. The city is not responsible for keeping registration or other records of credit. A person claiming a credit must present documents to show that the credit is available and applicable.

(b)  Pre-construction activities. The following procedures shall be followed prior to construction. 
(1)  Tree flagging. All trees to be removed from the construction site shall be flagged with bright red vinyl tape wrapped around the main trunk at a height of four (4) feet or more such that the tape is visible to workers on foot or operating heavy equipment. 
(2)  Protective fencing. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable tree disposition conditions, each protected tree to be preserved must be fenced during development or pre-development activity. 
a.  Fencing criteria. The tree disposition plan shall specify protective fencing of the critical root zone whenever reasonably practicable, unless a different area is prescribed in accordance with the criteria manual. Unless the tree disposition conditions specify otherwise: 
1.  A six-foot or higher fence must surround each protected tree or group of protected trees, effectively preventing persons, machinery, trash, material and other items from occupying the area within the protective fencing; 
2.  The fence must be constructed of durable, high visibility materials supported on poles or fence posts set firmly in the ground; 
3.  The fence must be able to resist intrusions and impacts likely to be encountered on a construction site; 
4.  The fence may incorporate existing fences or walls as well as temporary fencing; and 
5.  Each fence must display a prominent bilingual warning sign as set forth in the criteria manual. 
b.  Fence permit. A separate fence permit is not required for construction of a fence under this section, if a permit for the work is in effect and includes tree disposition conditions. 
c.  Trash, storage prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to use the area within the protective fencing, required by this section, for trash disposal, storage, vehicle parking or any other use that could adversely affect tree roots. 
(3)  Bark protection. In situations where a protected tree remains in the immediate area of intended construction, the tree shall be protected by enclosing the entire circumference of the tree's trunk with lumber encircled with wire or other means that does not damage the tree. 
(4)  Construction pruning. In cases where a tree has a low canopy or limbs may be broken during the course of construction, the obtrusive limb(s) may be cut. Pruning shall be done according to the National Association of Arborists standards. 
(5)  Mulch. In areas where construction of protection fencing is prohibitive, the addition of four (4) inches of shredded mulch or wood chips covered by a sheet of three-quarter-inch plywood is necessary to reduce the risk of severe soil compaction. The mulch shall be spread on-site or removed following the completion of the project. 
(6)  Watering. Trees which are being protected should receive supplemental water during times of drought or low rainfall. As a rule of thumb a weekly application of approximately fifty (50) gallons of water per one-inch diameter applied slowly to the root zone will be sufficient. 
(c)  Improvement within the critical root zone of a protected tree. Design constraints dictate that trees slated for preservation have some encroachment on their critical root zone. The following is the minimum design criteria which are allowed within the critical root zone of a protected tree. Development exceeding the criteria would put the tree at risk and therefore it could no longer be considered a protected tree. In such a case, replacement trees shall be required. 
(1)  Grade changes. In the event that grade changes must be made around a protected tree or group of trees, the following shall be implemented in order to maintain oxygen and water exchange within the tree's critical root zone. 
a.  A minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the critical root zone shall be preserved at natural grade with natural ground cover or landscaping for the tree to be considered a protected tree. 
b.  No cut or fill greater than two (2) inches shall be located closer to the tree trunk than one-half of the radius of the critical root zone radius distance. 
c.  Increase grade: Soil grade within the critical root zone of trees should not be increased more than one (1) to two (2) inches per year. Any increase above this can be very detrimental to the tree. Any attempts to protect trees from the detrimental effects of increased grade, must be approved by the city manager or his/her designee. 
d.  Decrease grade: Provide retaining walls outside the drip line to mitigate cuts. 
(2)  Boring of utilities. Boring may be permitted under protected trees in certain circumstances. The minimum length of the bore shall be the width of the tree's canopy and shall be a minimum depth of forty-eight (48) inches. 
(3)  Trenching. Irrigation systems shall be designed to avoid trenching across the critical root zone of any large tree. 
(4)  Paving. A maximum of twenty-five (25) percent of the critical root zone of a protected tree may be covered with impervious material. The pavement and the cut and fill for the pavement shall not exceed one-half (1/2) of the critical root zone radius distance. 
(Ord. No. 1108-1, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 291/2-29. - Tree planting regulations. 
(a)  Easements and rights-of-way. The location of replacement trees shall not be an area such that the mature canopy or roots of the tree will interfere with any public utility. No tree shall be planted within ten (10) feet of a fire hydrant. 
(b)  Off-site planting of replacement trees. Replacement trees should be planted on the site or easement from which the existing trees are to be removed. If this is not feasible, an applicant may initiate a proposal to plant trees off-site. This may be approved if the planting site is in reasonable proximity to the project area. 
(c)  Plantings after project completion. Replacement trees shall be planted prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or project release. Optimum planting times do not always correspond with project completion. For that reason, replacement tree plantings may take place after the project is released by the city; provided, that before project release, a fiscal security is posted in the amount equal to the prevailing rate for installed trees with a one-year guarantee, plus fifteen (15) percent to cover administrative cost. 
(d)  Visibility triangle. It shall be unlawful for any person to plant, grow or maintain any plant material, except a tree, within a visibility triangle, if the plant has, or probably will have, a height greater than three (3) feet above the street. It shall be unlawful for any person to plant, grow or maintain a tree which has branches or foliage within or above the visibility triangle at a height lower than fifteen (15) feet above the street. It is presumed that a person who owns or controls real property within the city maintains all trees and plants on that property. The city may enter a visibility triangle and remove growths prohibited by this section, and there shall be no liability to others for taking or not taking such action. 
(Ord. No. 1108-1, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 291/2-30. - Violations/enforcement. 
(a)  Removal, damaging, killing of protected trees. Except as authorized by tree disposition plan filed and approved under this article, it shall be unlawful, at any time, for a person to remove, damage or kill a protected tree within the city, or for a person who owns or controls any existing or potential buildable site, to cause or allow a protected tree to be removed, damaged or killed if it is located within the buildable area. 
(b)  Conditions. It shall be unlawful for any person who applies for or receives a permit regulated by this article to fail or refuse to comply with a condition of the permit or this article. Any related permit for the building site in question may be withheld until the condition is complied with to the satisfaction of the city manager or his/her designee or any other city staff members who are called upon to enforce this article. 
(c)  Immediate shutdown. Violations of this article may cause the immediate cessation of all work on the property until the violation is remedied or the builder agrees to replace damaged trees, if the damage is likely to cause the ultimate death of the tree. 
(d)  Building inspectors. All city building inspectors shall monitor for compliance of the tree protection and preservation ordinance and have the authority to shut down a job for infractions. Protective fencing shall be inspected prior to construction. 
(e)  Penalty clause. Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the provisions of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon final conviction thereof shall be fined in a sum not to exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) for each offense. Each day such violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense. But in case any person, firm or corporation violates any of the provisions of this article or fails to comply therewith, the City of Pearland, in addition to imposing the penalties above provided, may institute any appropriate action or proceedings in court to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate or to prevent any illegal act pertaining to trees protected by this article; and the definition of any violation of the terms of this article as a misdemeanor, shall not preclude the City of Pearland from invoking the civil remedies given it by law in such cases; but same shall be cumulative of and in addition to the penalties prescribed for such violation. 
(f)  Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to prosecution under this article that: (i) immediate action to remove, damage or kill the tree in question was necessary to prevent harm to persons or property, (ii) an appropriate tree disposition plan had been filed and approved, (iii) there was full compliance with all conditions of the tree disposition plan.

(Ord. No. 220-8, § 4, 2-14-00) 
Sec. 30-24. - Termination procedures. 
(a)  Nonemergency termination. Whenever the city is authorized to terminate a customer's water services against that customer's consent and under the provisions of this subsection or whenever the city otherwise terminates water services to a customer in a nonemergency situation other than by the customer's request, the city shall first provide notice in the form and manner described below to the customer and afford the customer an opportunity for a hearing in the form and manner described below before the termination of such services. If after the city has complied with the notice requirements as described below, the customer does not request a hearing for review of the termination within the specified time, the city may terminate water services to the customer on the day and at the time specified in the notice to the customer or within five (5) calendar days thereafter. Any time elapsing after the declared termination date, the elapsing of which is due to the pendency of a hearing or the extension of time granted pursuant to a hearing, shall not be considered when calculating the five (5) days in which the city may terminate water after a declared termination date. 
(1)  Notice. Notice must be sent to a water customer at least eight (8) days prior to the proposed termination date of the services to that customer if notice is sent by mail, or at least five (5) days prior to termination if notice is delivered by the utility billing department. The notice may be incorporated into the customer's monthly bill, sent by certified letter, or hand delivered to the customer by a utility billing department employee or other person designated by the city to deliver such notices. The notice must be written and clearly communicate the following information: 
a.  The name of the customer whose service is proposed to be terminated; 
b.  The address where service is proposed to be terminated; 
c.  The reason for the proposed termination, including the amount of delinquency if nonpayment of charges is the reason for termination; 
d.  The day and time after which the water service will be terminated unless the conditions bringing about the termination are sooner remedied; 
e.  That the customer has the right to appear and be heard at a hearing to contest the proposed termination prior to the date of termination if the customer believes that there is an error in the reason for the proposed termination, including, but not limited to, an error in the existence or amount of a delinquency; 
f.  The means by which the customer may arrange for such a hearing; 
g.  The date by which the customer must request and set the hearing in order to receive it, which deadline may be no earlier than one day prior to the termination date, nor may that deadline ever be sooner than five (5) days from the date of sending of notice, the five (5) days not including weekdays on which city offices are closed for holidays. 
(2)  After the deadline for requesting a hearing, as described in subsection (a)(1)g. above, has passed, a customer may still request a hearing to review the decision to terminate the customer's water service within ten (10) days of the mentioned deadline upon presentation to the city manager of an affidavit declaring that the customer, through no fault of that customer, did not receive notice of termination in time to act upon the same. When a hearing pursuant to this subsection is requested, the city manager shall as soon as practicable make a determination of whether the appeal appears to be meritorious, and if the city manager finds it is meritorious the city manager shall order the continuation or restoration of services pending the appeal. If the hearing officer finds in favor of the customer, the hearing officer may order restoration of service. 
(3)  If the customer to whom water service is proposed to be terminated is a landlord who supplies water services to tenant water users, the city shall attempt to give notice to the tenant water users pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. 
(4)  Hearing. Should any customer request a hearing to review the decision to terminate that customer's water services, the hearing shall be presided over by the city manager or any fair and neutral person he may appoint, which person must be of managerial employment and not involved in the original decision to terminate services, hereafter in this context known as the hearing officer. The hearing shall be held no sooner then the next business day nor later than fifteen (15) business days after being requested by the customer. The hearing officer may, in his discretion, delay or advance the hearing time upon showing of good cause by the customer. At the hearing, the customer shall be given the opportunity to be heard in person to present the customer's case, to present testimony from other persons, and to admit documents. The customer may be represented by counsel, though the city shall in no case provide counsel. The customer shall be given the opportunity to confront and cross examine any witnesses appearing against him at the hearing. The customer may request that a representative of the utility billing department be present at the hearing and be subject to questioning. However, the rules of evidence for civil or criminal trials need not be enforced. The city's reasons for terminating the customer's water service shall be stated at the hearing. Upon reaching a final decision, the hearing officer shall state his reasons for reaching that decision and state the evidence on which he relied in reaching those conclusions. Should the hearing officer find in favor of the customer, the customer's water service shall continue. Should the hearing officer find against the customer, the customer's water service shall be terminated. The hearing officer shall have the power to grant extensions, modify billings, and fashion other reliefs as would be equitable. 
(b)  Emergency termination. Whenever the city is specifically authorized by this Code to act pursuant to this subsection or whenever the city shall deem it necessary due to an emergency situation to terminate a customer's water service prior to giving notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the city shall give the customer whose water service has been terminated notice of that termination according to the requirements described below and afford that customer an opportunity for a post-termination hearing to review the decision to terminate. 
(1)  Notice. Whenever the city shall terminate a customer's water service pursuant to this subsection, the city shall post notice on the door of the premises to which water service was terminated, if possible, and shall on that day send by certified letter notice to the customer at the customer's usual billing address. The notice shall be in writing and shall clearly communicate the following information: 
a.  The name of the customer; 
b.  The address to which service has been terminated; 
c.  The reason for the termination; 
d.  The customer has the right to appear and be heard at a hearing to review the termination; 
e.  The customer must request the hearing for review of the termination within twenty (20) days of the termination; 
f.  The means by which the customer may request the hearing for review of the termination. 
If the customer to whom water service has been terminated is a landlord who supplies water services to tenant water users, the city shall attempt to give notice to the tenant water users pursuant to the procedure set forth in subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  If a customer shall request a hearing to review the prior termination of that customer's services, that request must be lodged by the customer within twenty (20) days after termination and notice. Should the hearing officer find in favor of the customer, water service shall be reconnected, otherwise to remain disconnected. The hearing shall in all other respects, nature, procedures, and consequences be identical to that described in subsection (a)(2) of this section. 
(c)  Notice to tenant users. If a customer to whom water service is proposed to be terminated or has been terminated, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section, is a landlord who supplies water to tenant users, and the city is aware or should be aware that the customer supplies water to tenant users, then the city shall provide notice to the tenant users of the proposed termination or past termination. The notice to the tenant user need not state the name of that tenant user nor the name of the water customer, but must communicate sufficient information to inform the tenant user that his premises is covered by the proposed or actual termination. The tenant user shall have the same rights to appeal that the customer of the water services has under the foregoing provisions of this section and shall be so informed by the notice. The notice to the tenant users shall in all other respects comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section if water service is proposed to be terminated or with subsection (b)(1) of this section if services have already been terminated. Notices to tenant users may be sent by United States mail addressed to the appropriate street address of the dwelling or commercial unit, or posted on the door of the dwelling or commercial unit, or hand delivered to the tenant or any other person residing at or employed at the tenant's premises. 
If the appropriate physical facilities are in place and the tenant otherwise meets the requirements of this chapter, the tenant user may establish water service in his own name without being held responsible for any delinquencies owed by the landlord. 
(Ord. No. 220-8, § 5, 2-14-00) 
Sec. 30-25. - Utility liens. 
(a)  Water. 
(1)  After the city has terminated a customer's water service pursuant to the requirements of section 30-24 of this chapter, or after the city terminates water service at a customer's request, the city's utility billing supervisor shall file a lien on the property which the terminated water service served and in the amount that the customer whose service was terminated owed to the city for water service at the time of the termination of services. 
(2)  If a property receives water services illegally, without having an account with the city utility billing department, then the utility billing supervisor shall file a lien against that property in the amount of the proper charge for the water actually used, or, if there is no way of determining the amount of water used, in the amount of the minimum monthly water charge that would have been charged to that property had a legitimate account been opened there multiplied by the number of months during which that property illegally received such water services. 
(b)  Garbage collection. 
(1)  After the city has terminated a customer's water service pursuant to the requirements of section 30-24 of this chapter, or after the city terminates water service or garbage service at the customer's request, or after a customer without water service becomes more than fifty dollars ($50.00) delinquent for garbage service alone, the city's utility billing supervisor shall file a lien on the property which the terminated garbage service served and in the amount that the customer whose service was terminated owed to the city for garbage collection service at the time of the termination of services. 
(2)  If a property receives garbage collection services illegally, without having an account with the city utility billing department, then the utility billing supervisor shall file a lien against that property in the amount of the minimum monthly garbage collection charge that would have been charged to that property had a legitimate account been opened there multiplied by the number of months during which that property illegally received such garbage collection services. 
(c)  Sewerage. 
(1)  After the city has terminated a customer's water service pursuant to the requirements of section 30-24 of this chapter, or after the city terminates water service or sewer service at the customer's request, or after a customer without water service becomes more then fifty dollars ($50.00) delinquent in payment for sewerage charges alone to the city, the city's utility billing supervisor shall file a lien on the property which the terminated water service served and in the amount that the customer whose service was terminated owed to the city for sewerage service at the time of the termination of services or the accumulation of the aforementioned delinquency in payment for sewerage services. 
(2)  If a property receives sewerage services illegally, without having an account with the city utility billing department, then the utility billing supervisor shall file a lien against that property in the amount of the minimum monthly sewerage charge that would have been charged to that property had a legitimate account been opened there multiplied by the number of months during which that property illegally received such sewerage services. 
(d)  [Exceptions.] If a customer owes less then fifty dollars ($50.00) for the aggregate sum of water charges, garbage collection charges, and sewerage charges at the time of termination of any of those services, no lien shall be filed against the property served by those services. If the customer is not delinquent in payment at the time of termination of any of the services, no lien shall be filed until that customer becomes delinquent in payment. No lien shall be filed on any property that the city knows to be a homestead as defined by the Texas Constitution. 
(e)  [Filing of lien; interest; filing fees, etc.] Any lien authorized by this section shall be filed with the County Clerk of Brazoria County, Texas, or with the county clerk of the county in which the property to which the lien will be attached is located. The city shall then have a privileged lien on as many lots or pieces of property as the terminated services previously served and are described on the lien instrument by metes and bounds, or by city lot and block description, or by any other adequate description. The lien shall secure the charges made by the city to these above discussed services rendered to that property. Such a lien shall be filed pursuant to the authority granted in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. Art. 1175 § 11 (Vernon 1963) and Tex. Const. Art. XI, § 5. The lien shall bear ten (10) percent per annum interest. The utility billing supervisor shall add to any lien filed pursuant to this section the amount of the filing fee charged by the county clerk for filing that lien. The lien shall be effective against that property if the account holder or user of services of that property was either the owner of that property, a tenant of that property or a permissive holder of that property, or an adverse possessor of that property.

(h)  Declaration of rental property. 
(1)  The owner of any property, which property is rented to another and such tenant carries city water, sewer, or garbage collection services in the tenant's name, may prevent the city from using that property as security for the water, sewer, and garbage. 
(2)  When such a declaration has been filed with the city prior to the time the account holder begins to receive services, the city shall collect a deposit in the amount of two hundred dollars ($200.00) if the property to receive services is a single family residence, or two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) if the property to receive services is a business or commercial establishment. If a property owner wishes to declare in regard to the bill of a person or entity already receiving services at a particular property, that declaration shall not be effective until the posting of a deposit in the appropriate amounts as described above. 
(3)  Paragraph (h)(2) of this subsection notwithstanding, an owner of property who files the above described declaration on property, which is rented to another and the tenant is carrying the city water, sewer, or garbage collection services in the tenant's name at the time of the passage of this section, then such declaration shall become immediately effective without the posting of a deposit in the amounts set forth in paragraph (2). However, if water service is terminated to that tenant for delinquency in payment, a deposit in the appropriate amount as described above shall be collected before such city water, sewer, or garbage collection service is resumed. Any service account for water, sewer, or garbage collection service established after the passage of this section shall be subject to paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) above of this subsection. 
(4)  The declaration of rental property shall be valid only so long as the person making such declaration owns such property, rents such property to another, and the tenant of such property carries city water, sewer, or garbage collection services in the tenant's name. The owner may revoke the declaration of rental property at any time by so notifying the city in writing.

Diiviisiion 1  Generrall Prroviisiions
Secttiion 1..1..1..1 Source off Autthoriitty
(a) Authority. Authority under this Unified Development Code shall be vested in and
delegated to the officials and decision-makers designated in this Article 1 under the
City's charter, the constitution and laws of the state of Texas and the City Code.
This authority shall be deemed supplemental to any other authority lawfully conferred
upon the officials and decision-makers. The omission of a citation in this Unified
Development Code to any authority conferred upon the officials and decision-makers
under the City's charter, the constitution or laws of the state of Texas or the City
Code, nor the failure to identify in this article authority conferred by other provisions
of this Unified Development Code, shall not be construed as limiting the actions of
such officials and decision-makers taken in accordance with and in reliance upon
such authority.
Secttiion 1..1..1..2 IImplliied Autthoriitty
(a) Authority. The officials and decision-makers shall have all implied authority
necessary to carry out the duties and responsibilities expressly delegated by this
Unified Development Code to the extent the implied authority is not in conflict with
the expressly delegated authority.
Secttiion 1..1..1..3 Liimiittattiion on Autthoriitty
(a) City Policy. It is the policy of the City that the standards and procedures applicable
to development of property within the City limits and within the City's extraterritorial
jurisdiction are as stated in this Unified Development Code, notwithstanding any
representation by any City official summarizing, paraphrasing or otherwise
interpreting such standards to the contrary, whether generally or as applied to
development of specific property.
(b) Representations Concerning Future Action on Development Application or
Legislative Action. No City official, whether an employee of the City or a member
of an appointed board or commission, or a member of the governing body of the City,
shall have the authority to make representations to a property owner concerning the
likelihood of an outcome of that official's decision or the decision of an appointed
board or commission or the City Council, on any development application or
legislative action that has yet to be filed or is pending before the City for decision. An
official may, however, upon request of a person, convey information concerning that
official's position on a pending application in accordance with procedures established
in this Chapter 1. No person is entitled to rely upon any representation made by an
official in contravention of this Subsection, and each and every such representation
shall be deemed in violation of the policy of the City, and is not binding on the City in
any respect. No subsequent decision of the City shall be deemed a ratification of
any representation made in contravention of this Subsection.
(c) Representations Concerning Future Amendments. No City official, whether an
employee of the City or a member of an appointed board or commission, or a
member of the City Council, shall have the authority to make binding representations
to any person concerning the likelihood that a change in any legislative classification
Chapter 1: General Provisions
Page 1 - 6
or a change in the text of this Unified Development Code as applied to a specific
tract of land will be granted, or that an existing legislative classification or text
provision will remain in effect, or that any petition for relief will be granted. No person
is entitled to rely upon any representation made by an official in contravention of this
Subsection, and each and every such representation shall be deemed in violation of
the policy of the City, and is not binding on the City in any respect. No subsequent
decision of the City shall be deemed a ratification of any representation made in
contravention of this Subsection.
(d) Effect of Comprehensive Plan, Ordinance or Development Standard on
Liability Claims. The City's approval of a development application under the
standards and procedures of this Unified Development Code does not guarantee or
assure that development of the property in accordance with the standards will
prevent, minimize or mitigate harm to adjoining property. A person who undertakes
development activities shall not rely on the City's approval of a development
application as ensuring that the development activities will not result in harm to
adjoining property. The regulations contained in this Unified Development Code
constitute an exercise of the City's governmental authority, and approval of a
development application shall not give rise to any liability on the part of the City or its
officers, agents and employees, nor will an approval release the applicant from any
liability for harm arising out of development of the property under applicable law.

Secttiion 1..3..2..1 Purpose,, Applliicabiilliitty and Effffectt
(a) Purpose. The purpose of a petition for relief from a dedication or construction
requirement is to assure that the application of uniform dedication and construction
standards to a proposed plat does not result in a disproportionate burden on the
Chapter 1: General Provisions
Page 1 - 33
property owner, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands
created by the proposed development on the City's public facilities systems.
(b) Applicability. A petition for relief under this section may be filed by a property
owner to contest any requirement to dedicate land or to construct public
improvements for dedication to the public that is imposed under the Citys public
facilities standards in Chapter 3 of this Unified Development Code to a plat
application or to any related development application authorized under this Code,
whether the requirement is under uniform standards, or attached as a condition to
approval of the petition or permit. A petition under this section shall not be used to
waive standards on grounds applicable to a petition for a waiver under Section
3.1.1.6 of this UDC.
(c) Effect. If the relief requested under the petition is granted in whole or in part by the
City Council, the dedication or construction requirement initially imposed shall be
modified accordingly, and the standards applied or the conditions attached to initial
approval of the development application shall be thereafter applied in accordance
with the relief granted. In the event the original application was denied by the
decision-maker based upon the property owner's failure to incorporate the dedication
or construction requirement in the proposed permit, the application shall be
remanded to the original decision-maker for a decision consistent with the relief
granted by the Council.
Secttiion 1..3..2..2 Pettiittiion Requiirementts

may be filed by a property owner or the applicant for a plat application, in which the
dedication or construction requirement has been applied or attached as a condition
of approval, or as grounds for denying the plat application.
(b) Form of Petition. The petition for relief from a dedication or construction
requirement shall allege that application of the standard or the imposition of
conditions relating to the dedication or construction requirement is not roughly
proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed
development on the City's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or parks system, as
the case may be, or does not reasonably benefit the proposed development.
(c) Study Required. The petitioner shall provide a study in support of the petition for
relief that includes the following information:
(1) Total capacity of the City's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park
system to be utilized by the proposed development, employing standard
measures of capacity and equivalency tables relating the type of development
proposed to the quantity of system capacity to be consumed by the
development. If the proposed development is to be developed in phases, such
information also shall be provided for the entire development proposed,
including any phases already developed.
(2) Total capacity to be supplied to the City's water, wastewater, roadway,
drainage or park system by the proposed dedication of an interest in land or
construction of capital improvements. If the development application is part of

a phased development, the information shall include any capacity supplied by
prior dedications or construction of capital improvements.
(3) Comparison of the capacity of the City's public facilities system(s) to be
consumed by the proposed development with the capacity to be supplied to
such system(s) by the proposed dedication of an interest in land or construction
of capital improvements. In making this comparison, the impacts on the City's
public facilities system(s) from the entire development shall be considered.
(4) The effect of any City participation in the costs of oversizing the capital
improvement to be constructed in accordance with the City's requirements.
(5) Any other information that shows the alleged disproportionality between the
impacts created by the proposed development and the dedication or
construction requirement imposed by the City.
(d) Time for Filing Petition and Study. A petition for relief from a dedication or
construction requirement shall be filed with the responsible official within ten (10)
days of the Planning and Zoning Commission's decision to conditionally approve or
deny an application for approval of a Preliminary Subdivision Plat or a Preliminary
Development Plat, or where no Preliminary Subdivision Plat or Preliminary
Development Plat application has been submitted, an application for approval of a
Final Subdivision Plat or Final Development Plat. The study in support of the petition
shall be filed within 30 days of the initial decision, unless the petitioner seeks an

Diiviisiion 1  Applliicattiion fforr Zoniing Map Amendmentt
Secttiion 2..2..1..1 Purpose,, Applliicabiilliitty and Effffectt
(a) Purpose. The purpose of an application for a zoning map amendment is to establish
the initial zoning district classification of land, or to authorize a use of land, or in the
case of overlay zoning districts, to authorize uses or a set of zoning standards for the
land that are not presently authorized under the regulations for the zoning district in
which the property is located.
(b) Applicability. Where a property owner seeks to establish an initial zoning district
classification for land, or to establish a use of land or through an overlay district to
apply standards to a proposed use that are not currently authorized by the zoning
district regulations currently in effect, the property owner must submit a petition for a
zoning map amendment before seeking approval of any development application for
such land. The requirements of this division do not apply to land outside of the City
limits. The requirements of this division do apply to land annexed to the City upon
the effective date of the annexation.
(c) Effect. Enactment of an ordinance approving an application for a zoning map
amendment results in an initial or a change in zoning district classification for the
property, and the use of the land thereafter is subject to all requirements of the new
zoning district.
Secttiion 2..2..1..2 Purpose,, Applliicabiilliitty and Effffectt
(a) Responsible Official. The Planning Director shall be the responsible official for an
application for a zoning map amendment.
(b) Initiation of Zoning Map Amendment. Only the property owner or the owner's
authorized agent (proof of such authorization must be submitted with the zoning
application), the Director, the Planning and Zoning Commission, or the City Council
on its own motion, may initiate an application for a zoning map amendment.
(1) In the event the ownership stated on an application is different from that shown
in City or appraisal district records, the applicant shall submit written proof of
ownership or verification that the applicant is acting as an authorized agent for
the property owner.
(2) A landowner or agent seeking approval of an application for a zoning map
amendment shall pay or otherwise satisfy all delinquent taxes, paving
assessments, impact fees, or any other delinquent debts or obligations for the
property to be rezoned at the time the application is submitted. It shall be the
applicant's responsibility to provide evidence or proof that all taxes and
obligations have been paid.
(c) Accompanying Application. An application for a zoning map amendment may be
accompanied by an application for amendment of the Citys Comprehensive Plan,
upon which the application for the zoning map amendment is dependent, or an
application for a preliminary plat.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-8
(1) The Comprehensive Plan amendment shall be adopted in conformance with
State law and in a manner consistent with the way in which the Comprehensive
Plan is generally adopted.
(2) The Comprehensive Plan amendment and the zoning map amendment may be
processed concurrently as long as the recommendation and decision on the
Comprehensive Plan amendment is made first;
(3) The application for the zoning map amendment shall be decided prior to any
accompanying application for a preliminary plat that is dependent on the map
amendment.
Secttiion 2..2..1..3 Processiing off Zoniing Applliicattiion and Deciisiion
(a) Published and Personal Notice. The Director shall cause personal notice of a joint
public hearing on the zoning map amendment before the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council to be given in accordance with Chapter 1, Article 2,
Division 2 of this Unified Development Code.
(b) Posted Notice. Notification signs of a public hearing on the application for a zoning
map amendment, stating the purpose of the hearing, shall be posted on the subject
property in conformance with Section 1.2.2.4 of this UDC.
(c) Special Notice. The City Council, by a two-thirds vote, may prescribe a different
form of notice for the joint public hearing on a zoning amendment, in which case the
notice requirements of Chapter 1, Article 2, Division 2 of this UDC do not apply.
(d) Joint Public Hearing. The City Council and the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall convene a joint public hearing on the zoning map amendment at the time and
place designated in the notice of public hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in
accordance with Chapter 1, Article 2, Division 3. The Mayor shall be the presiding
officer at the joint public hearing.
(e) Action by Commission.
(1) Following the joint public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
formulate its report and recommendation, and shall forward the report and
recommendation to the City Council.
(2) The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of
the zoning district designation sought by the applicant. If the Planning and
Zoning Commission recommends denial of the zoning district designation
sought by the applicant, the Commission may recommend approval of a less
intense zoning district designation within the same zoning category if the
category is Residential, Commercial, or Industrial. A district shall be
considered less intense if it is listed in Section 2.4.1.2 of this UDC before the
district sought by the applicant.
(f) Decision.
(1) The City Council shall consider the report of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and the application for the zoning map amendment.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-9
(2) The City Council may vote on either the recommendation by the Planning and
Zoning Commission regarding the zoning district designation sought in the
application or any recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission
for approval of an alternate and less intense zoning district designation.
(3) The City Council may consider and vote on a zoning district designation
within the same category, if the category is Residential, Commercial, or
Industrial, that is less intense than the zoning district designation sought by
the application without returning the application to the Planning and Zoning
Commission. A district shall be considered less intense if it is listed in
Section 2.4.1.2 of this UDC before the district sought by the applicant.
(4) If the City Council wants to consider a zoning district designation more
intense than that recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the
Council shall return the application to the Planning and Zoning Commission
with direction to make a recommendation on the alternate designation
suggested by the City Council. A district shall be considered more intense if it
is listed after the recommended zoning district in Section 2.4.1.2 of this UDC.
(g) Ordinance. Approval of the Council of the zoning map amendment shall be in the
form of an ordinance that amends the City's official Zoning Map. The Planning
Director shall identify each zoning map amendment on the Zoning Map in
accordance with the change approved by the Council. Any unauthorized change of
the official Zoning Map hereby is deemed to be null and void.
(h) Super Majority Vote. In each of the following circumstances, a zoning amendment
shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of all
members of the City Council:
(1) When a written protest against the amendment is signed by the owners of
twenty percent (20%) or more of either the area of the lots or land included in
the proposed change, or of the lots or land adjoining or within two hundred
feet (200) of the lots or land. In computing the percentage of land area, the
area of streets and alleys shall be included in the computation. For purposes
of this subsection, the following shall apply:
a. The written protest of any one owner of land owned by two or more
persons shall be presumed to be the protest of all such owners.
b. The written protest must be submitted to the City Secretary at least five

Diiviisiion 2  Applliicattiion fforr Pllanned Devellopmentt ((PD)) Diisttrriictt
Secttiion 2..2..2..1 Purpose,, Applliicabiilliitty,, Natture and Siize off Diisttriictt
(a) Purpose. The purpose of an overlay planned development zoning district ("PD
District") is to provide for the development of land as an integral unit for single or
mixed use in accordance with a PD Design Plan that may include uses, regulations
and other requirements that vary from the provisions of other zoning districts. PD
Districts are intended to implement generally the goals and objectives of the City's
Comprehensive Plan. PD Districts are also intended to encourage flexible and
creative planning, to ensure the compatibility of land uses, to allow for the adjustment
of changing demands to meet the current needs of the community, and to result in a
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-11
higher quality development for the community than would result from the use of
conventional zoning districts.
(b) Applicability. A PD district may only be established in one of the following
circumstances:
(1) The land is located in close proximity to established residential neighborhoods
where conventional zoning classifications may not adequately address
neighborhood concerns regarding the quality or compatibility of the adjacent
development, and where it may be desirable to the neighborhood, the
developer or the City to develop and implement mutually-agreed, enforceable
development standards;
(2) The land, or adjacent property that would be impacted by the development of
the land, has sensitive or unique environmental features requiring a more
flexible approach to zoning and clustering of uses, or special design standards,
in order to afford the best possible protection of the unique qualities of the site
or the adjacent property;
(3) The land is proposed for development as a mixed-use development or a
traditional neighborhood development requiring more flexible and innovative
design standards;
(4) The land consists of Old Townsite and/or other older sections of Pearland that
are proposed for redevelopment or infill development, and special design
considerations are deemed desirable;
(5) The land serves as transition between different and seemingly incompatible
land uses;
(6) The land is proposed for development as a major office, retail, commercial or
industrial employment center, and special design standards may be warranted;
(7) The land is of such a character that it is in the community's best interest to
encourage high quality development through flexible development standards to
further the goals and objectives of the City's Comprehensive Plan; and
(8) The land consists of unusually configured parcels that cannot be developed
efficiently under the base district standards.
(c) Nature of the District. Each PD District shall be established as an overlay zoning
district that combines with one or more base zoning districts. Development in a PD
district must be consistent with a Design Plan that is incorporated as part of the
district by the adopting ordinance for the PD, except as provided in Section
2.2.2.6(b).
(d) Minimum District Size. No PD district shall be established for a gross contiguous
area less than the following:
(1) Single-family detached, attached and duplex uses: five (5) acres;
(2) Multiple-family uses: five (5) acres;
(3) Non-residential uses: three (3) acres;
(4) Mixed residential and nonresidential uses: three (3) acres.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-12
(e) Maximum Density. The maximum density for any residential use within a PD shall
not exceed the maximum density allowed in the base zoning district.
Secttiion 2..2..2..2 Autthoriized Uses
(a) Base Zoning District Uses. Any use permitted outright or conditionally in the base
district shall be permitted in the PD district, unless the use is prohibited or otherwise
conditioned in the regulations adopted for the PD district. Uses designated as
conditional uses in the Land Use Matrix in Article 5, Division 2, Chapter 2 of this
Ordinance may be authorized in the PD district only if designated on the Design Plan
adopted as part of the PD district, in which case the use does not require a separate
Conditional Use Permit under Article 2, Division 3, Chapter 2 of this Ordinance.
(b) Overlay Zoning District Uses. The PD district may provide for uses not allowed in
the base zoning district, provided that the uses are compatible with the stated
purposes of the district and do not conflict with policies in the Comprehensive Plan,
considering the arrangement, combination and design features of the uses within the
PD district, as depicted on the Design Plan.
(c) Location and Arrangement of Uses. The location and arrangement of all
authorized uses in the PD district shall be consistent with the Design Plan approved
with the district.
(d) Limitations on Residential Uses. Proposed lot sizes for residential uses in the PD
district shall be no smaller on average than the lot sizes allowed in the base zoning
district for each type of housing (e.g., single-family, duplex, etc.). A maximum of ten
percent (10%) deviation in the size of the lots is permitted in order to provide
improved design, or to provide flexibility in the layout of the subdivision or diversity in
lot size choices.
(e) Deviations from the Design Plan. Refer to Section 2.2.2.6 for regulations related
to deviations from the Design Plan.
Secttiion 2..2..2..3 Devellopmentt Sttandards
(a) Base District and Supplemental Standards. In a PD district, uses shall conform to
the standards in the base zoning district governing area, building and height
requirements in this ordinance, and any applicable supplemental standards, unless
specifically excepted in the ordinance establishing the PD district.
(b) Overlay Zoning District Standards. In a PD district, standards otherwise
applicable to authorized uses in the base zoning district or pursuant to this ordinance
may be varied, and thereafter shall be applied to the uses established in the PD
district, only if approved in the ordinance establishing the PD district. Standards that
may be varied include, but may not be limited to, residential density (subject to
2.2.2.2(d) above), lot area, lot width, lot depth, yard depths and widths, building
height and size, building exterior construction, lot coverage, floor area ratio, parking,
access, screening, landscaping, accessory buildings, signage, sidewalks, and
lighting. Varied standards may increase or decrease the requirements otherwise
applicable to particular uses. Any graphic depictions used to illustrate such
standards, unless otherwise provided in the PD district regulations, shall be
considered standards that apply to subsequent development applications.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-13
(c) Usable Open Space Standards. In residential or mixed-use PD districts of twenty
(20) acres or more in size, unless otherwise expressly provided by the PD
regulations or designated in the PD Design Plan, the following standards governing
usable open space shall apply.
(1) A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the gross land area within the entire PD
district shall be devoted to usable open space, consistent with the open space
requirements of the City's Comprehensive Plan. Open space for PD districts
may be satisfied by either public or by a combination of public and private open
space. Open space requirements specified in this subsection are in addition to
requirements for site landscaping and buffering.
(2) Significant stands of native trees and shrubs shall be preserved and protected
from destruction or alteration.
(3) Open space requirements shall be satisfied for each phase of a multi-phased
residential development. If open space is not to be provided proportionally
among phases of development, the applicant must execute a reservation of
open space in a form that will assure the City that such open space will be
provided. The City may require that all open space within the district must be
provided prior to completion of development within the district.
(4) Detention/retention facilities may be counted as open space when they are
incorporated into the PD as an amenity, such as a lake or pond. The term
amenity is defined within Chapter 5 of this UDC.
(d) Public Facilities Standards. In order to implement the plan of development
depicted in the Design Plan and to assure that the purposes of the district are
realized, public facilities standards in subdivision regulations (Chapter 3 and Chapter
4, as applicable, of this UDC) may be varied, provided that such exceptions are
expressly identified in the PD district regulations and illustrated where necessary on
the Design Plan incorporated as part of the district regulations. Thereafter,
standards applicable to plat applications and applications for site plans shall conform
to the variations approved in the ordinance establishing the PD district.
(e) Public Facilities Studies. In order to justify variations from public facilities
standards pertaining to provision of roadway and drainage facilities and to
demonstrate compliance with the adequate public facilities policies in this ordinance,
a traffic impact study or drainage study may be required as a pre-requisite for
approving a petition for a PD district.

(1) An application for approval of a Site Development Plan, subdivision plat or site
plan, as may be required, shall be submitted for approval within two years of
the date of establishment of the PD District, unless otherwise provided in the
adopting ordinance. If a Site Development Plan for all or a phase of the
development depicted in the Design Plan is not submitted within such period,
the authority to submit such development and all subsequent site development
plans or required permits for the PD district shall be suspended.
(2) If the land within the PD district is to be developed in phases, a Site
Development Plan or other development application shall be submitted for the
next phase within two (2) years from approval of a Site Development Plan or
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-19
other development application for the preceding phase, or as otherwise
provided in the phasing schedule for the PD district. If a subsequent Site
Development Plan or other development application is not submitted within
such period, the authority to submit such Site Development Plan application for
that portion of the property and any subsequent site development plans or
other development applications for the PD district shall be suspended.
(3) Expiration of an approved Site Development Plan or other development
application shall result in suspension of the authority to submit a new Site
Development Plan or other development application for that portion of the
property and for subsequent phases of development within the district for which
a Site Development Plan or other development application has not been
approved.
(4) An approved Site Development Plan shall expire if a preliminary plat
application for single-family residential projects, or a site plan for any other
project, is not approved within two years of the date of approval of the Site
Development Plan.
(5) Expiration of the approved preliminary plat or site plan subsequently shall result
in expiration of the associated Site Development Plan. If the preliminary plat
or site plan is reinstated, the Site Development Plan shall be deemed to be
reinstated as well.
(b) Commission Recommendation on Authority to Submit Site Development Plan.
Following expiration of the right to submit a Site Development Plan or other
development application, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider
whether the undeveloped land within PD District should be changed to another
zoning classification in accordance with the procedures for action upon a zoning map
amendment pursuant to Section 2.3.2.2 of this UDC. The commission thereafter
shall recommend to the City Council whether the right to submit a Site Development
Plan or other development application should be reinstated, or whether the property
should be zoned to another classification.
(c) Council Consideration. The commission's recommendation shall be considered by
the City Council in accordance with procedures for action upon a zoning map
amendment pursuant to Section 2.3.2.2 of this UDC. The Council shall determine
whether the right to submit the Site Development Plan or other development
application should be reinstated, or whether the property should be rezoned to
another classification. In making such determination, the Council shall consider the
following factors:
(1) Whether the PD District remains consistent with the Comprehensive Plan;
(2) Whether the uses authorized in the PD district are compatible with existing and
planned land uses adjacent to the site;
(3) Whether there are extenuating circumstances justifying the failure to submit a
Site Development Plan or other development application during the applicable
time period; and
(4) Whether rezoning the property to another classification constitutes confiscation
of a vested property right or deprives the owner of the economically viable use
of the land.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-20
(d) Council Action. The City Council may take the following actions:
(1) Reinstate the right to submit the Site Development Plan application or other
development application within a time certain, subject to any conditions that
may be appropriate to ensure that significant progress will be made toward
development of land within the PD district;
(2) Modify the PD district regulations applicable to the property; or
(3) Repeal the PD district for the affected portions of the property and zone such
property to another zoning district classification.

Diiviisiion 3  Condiittiionall Use Perrmiitt ((CUP))
Secttiion 2..2..3..1 Purpose,, Applliicabiilliitty,, and Effffectt
(a) Purpose. The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to allow the establishment of
uses which may be suitable only in certain locations in a zoning district or only when
subject to standards and conditions that assure compatibility with adjoining uses.
Conditional uses are those uses which are generally compatible with the permitted
land uses in a given zoning district, but which require individual review of their
proposed location, design and configuration, and the imposition of conditions in order
to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location within a given zoning
district. Only those uses enumerated as conditional uses in a particular zoning
district, or those nonconforming uses which are damaged or destroyed, and which
are permitted to be reestablished under this Unified Development Code, shall be
authorized as conditional uses. Conditional uses shall not be considered zone
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-21
changes, but shall be treated as legislative acts of the City Council authorizing a
specific use within a zoning district.
(b) Applicability. A Conditional Use Permit is required to use or develop property within
the City limits for any use designated as a conditional use in the Land Use Matrix in
Chapter 2, Article 5 of this Unified Development Code for the zoning district in which
the property is located. The Conditional Use Permit application must be
accompanied by a Site Plan prepared in accordance with Article 1, Division 1 of
Chapter 4.
(c) Effect. Approval of a Conditional Use Permit authorizes the use or development of
the property in accordance with the conditions of the permit. Approval of a
Conditional Use Permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for
which the permit is issued and shall apply only to the property for which the permit is
issued. No conditionally permitted use shall be enlarged, extended, increased in
intensity or relocated unless an application is made for a new Conditional Use Permit
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. Initiation or development
of the use shall not be authorized until the applicant has secured all the permits and
approvals required by this Unified Development Code.

the following criteria:
(1) There are special circumstances or conditions arising from the physical
surroundings, shape, topography or other feature affecting the land such that
the strict application of the provisions of this Code to the proposed use would
create an undue hardship or inequity upon or for the applicant, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, in developing the land or deprive the applicant of
the reasonable and beneficial use of the land;
(2) The circumstances causing the hardship do not similarly affect all or most
properties in the vicinity of the petitioner's land;
(3) The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial
property right of the petitioner;

orderly use and enjoyment of other land within the area in accordance with the
provisions of this Code, or adversely affect the rights of owners or residents of
surrounding property;
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-29
(6) The hardship or inequity suffered by petitioner is not caused wholly or in
substantial part by the petitioner;
(7) The request for a variance is not based exclusively on the applicants desire for
increased financial gain from the property, or to reduce an existing financial
hardship; and
(8) The degree of variance requested is the minimum amount necessary to meet
the needs of applicant and to satisfy the standards in this section.
(e) Expiration and Extension.
(1) A variance to a standard applicable to a particular use shall expire within 90
days of the date the variance petition is granted, unless the property owner or
applicant files a complete application for a building permit with the City within
such period. The Board may extend the time for filing the building permit
application for good cause shown, but in any event, the expiration date for the
variance shall not be extended beyond one (1) year from the date the variance
was granted.
(2) If the building permit expires, the variance also shall expire. If the building
permit is extended, the variance also shall be extended.

Secttiion 2..3..1..1 Purpose off Regullattiions & Diisttriictts
(a) Accordance with the TLGC. The zoning regulations and districts contained in this
Chapter are established in accordance with an adopted comprehensive plan (and
related updates), as authorized by Chapter 211 of the Texas Local Government
Code, for the purpose of promoting the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare, and protecting and preserving places and areas of historical, cultural and/or
architectural importance and significance within the City limits. The zoning
regulations and districts contained in this Chapter have been designed to lessen the
congestion in the streets, to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers, to
ensure adequate light and air, to prevent the overcrowding of land and thus avoid
undue concentration of population, and to facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation, water supply, wastewater treatment, schools, parks and other public
requirements. They are established with reasonable consideration for, among other
things, the character of each zoning district and its peculiar suitability for the
particular uses specified, conserving the value of buildings and environmentally
sensitive features, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the
City.

shown on the Zoning Map, or if there arises a question as to how or
whether a parcel of property is zoned and such question cannot be

event more than one hundred and eight (180) calendar days thereafter, the Planning
Director shall, on the Directors own or upon application by property owners of the
annexed area, initiate proceedings to establish appropriate zoning on the newly
annexed territory. The Planning Director shall commence public notification and
other standard procedures for zoning amendments as set forth in Chapter 1 of this
Unified Development Code.
(b) Timing of Zoning. The proceedings to establish zoning may be undertaken
concurrently with annexation procedures (i.e., notices and public hearings).
However, the zoning approval and formal adoption of the ordinance establishing
zoning shall occur after annexation takes effect as a former action by the City
Council, and the zoning approval and formal adoption of the ordinance establishing
zoning shall occur as a separate and distinct action by the City Council.
(c) Initial Zoning. From the time an annexation takes effect until action is completed to
zone the land, the interim zoning of the land shall be considered to be Suburban
Development (SD) District, and all zoning and development regulations of the SD
zoning district shall be adhered to with respect to development and use of the land
that has been newly annexed.
(d) Proper Notification. The initial zoning of annexed land shall meet the requirements
for notification and public hearings as set forth in Chapter 1 of this Code and all
applicable State laws.
(e) Simultaneous Petition for Annexation & Zoning by a Landowner. The owner of
land to be annexed may submit an application for zoning the property simultaneously
with submission of a petition for annexation, but an annexation petition may not be
conditioned upon the approval of any particular zoning classification.
(f) Building Permit Required. No person shall erect, excavate, construct, proceed, or
continue with the erection or construction of any building or structure or add to,
enlarge, move, improve, alter, repair, convert, or demolish any building or structure
or cause the same to be done in any area of the City or in any newly annexed
territory to the City without first applying for and obtaining a building permit therefor
from the Enforcing Officer as may be required in applicable City ordinances.

Diiviisiion 3  Miixed Use Zoniing Diisttrriictts
Secttiion 2..4..3..1 SPD,, Specttrum Diisttriictt
(a) Purpose. The purpose of the Spectrum District is to provide a visually cohesive
district that allows for diverse land uses within one overall District and to provide a
zoning district that is consistent with the recommendations within the Citys adopted
2004 Comprehensive Plan Update. The Spectrum District is comprised of five (5)
Sub-Districts that provide areas for these different land uses in a compatible manner.
The requirements for development within each district are contained herein. The
Sub-Districts are as follows:
(1) District S1: The Beltway District: The S1 Sub-District is intended for
nonresidential development that typically desires high visibility from major
thoroughfares. Retail uses such as shops and restaurants should be the
primary uses within this Sub-District. A mall-like setting, either indoor or
outdoor, would be ideal for these locations. Pedestrian circulation should be a
prime consideration. In addition, science and technology related office uses
(also referred to as tech-flex) and/or Class A office uses developed within a
business park or corporate campus would also be appropriate. In addition,
development should respect natural features such as creeks and drainage
ways by integrating such features into the overall design of the site(s).
(2) District S2: The Mixed Use District: The S2 Sub-District is appropriate for a
variety of land uses, including hotels, a conference center/convention center,
tourism-oriented uses, commercial, light industrial, and science and technology
related uses. This wide variety of acceptable uses is intended to allow for
optimum market flexibility for development within the S2 area. Any commercial
and/or light industrial uses developed should be within a business park or
corporate campus with buildings and parking situated such that a feeling of
open space is created, and business activities should take place wholly within
buildings. Development should also respect natural features such as creeks
and drainage ways by integrating such features into the overall design of the
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-54
site(s). Walkability and pedestrian-orientation is important for this site due to its
central location within the overall Spectrum District.
(3) District S3: The Mixed UseHigh Density Residential District: The S3 Sub-
District is intended for Traditional Neighborhood Design (TND), which is
characterized by a vertical mix of nonresidential and residential uses, with retail
and/or office uses on the ground floor and residential uses above. In addition,
consistent with other areas of the Spectrum District, commercial, and light
industrial science and technology related uses developed within a business
park or corporate campus would also be appropriate within the S3 area.
Compatibility with residential uses should be an important design
consideration.
(4) District S4: The Light Industrial and Science & Technology District: The S4
Sub-District is intended for light industrial uses that may have some business
activity that takes place outside and/or some outside storage of materials. To
maintain the quality of the Spectrum District, however, such outside activity
and/or storage should be screened. The S4 Sub-District should provide positive
transition between development within the S5 Sub-District (discussed below)
and the S2 Sub-District. Design guidelines should ensure that businesses
provide an aesthetically pleasing view from the planned roadways.
(5) District S5: The Light & Heavy Industrial District: The S5 Sub-District is
intended for light or heavy industrial development that may have outside
business activity and outside storage. Much of the development to the south
and west of the Spectrum District area is characterized by heavy commercial
and industrial businesses, and the S5 Sub-District should provide transition
between these existing uses and the development within the S4 Sub-District.
Design guidelines should be established to ensure that future development
provides an aesthetically pleasing view from the planned roadways.
(b) Authorized Uses. The following are authorized uses under the regulations
established in this chapter:
(1) Permitted and conditional uses as authorized in the Land Use Matrix in Article
5, Division 2 of this Chapter 2;
(2) Accessory uses as authorized in Article 5, Division 3 of this Chapter 2.

Secttiion 2..5..5..1 Purpose,, Applliicabiilliitty,, & Confflliicttiing Regullattiions
(a) Purpose. These regulations are primarily intended to maximize the use of new and
existing towers to prevent the proliferation of unnecessary towers and to minimize
the adverse visual impacts of towers and antennas through design, location,
landscape and screening requirements.
(b) Applicability.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-135
(1) This article applies to towers and antennas located in any zoning district.
(2) This article does not apply to the following:
a. A receive-only television antenna or satellite dish less than four feet (4) in
diameter;
b. Satellite dish antenna that is a permitted accessory use as provided in
this chapter; or
c. A tower less than fifty feet (50) in height that is used as an amateur radio
station.
1. The Planning Department, however, may require the applicant to
submit information on the height, location, and the manufacturer's
drawings and specifications for the tower, or any other any
information as necessary to determine whether a Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) should be granted as required by this article.
(3) Any regulations relating to the height of a tower, alternate tower structure, or
antenna contained in this division of this UDC controls over any conflicting
provision of any other regulations not contained in this article.
Secttiion 2..5..5..2 Condiittiionall Use Permiitt Requiired
(a) Requirement & Procedures. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person
may not construct, erect, or maintain a tower or antenna on any land located within
the City without first receiving a conditional use permit. The procedures of this article
relating to the application, processing, and determination of whether to grant a
conditional use permit, are in addition to any other provisions and requirements
contained in other articles of these zoning regulations relating to conditional use
permits.
(b) Exemptions.
(1) Rooftop mounted towers and antennas may be located on any buildings
serving a nonresidential use and on an alternative tower structure without
obtaining a conditional use permit, if:
a. The structure, other than a tower on which the tower or antenna will be
placed, exceeds fifty feet (50) in height;
b. The tower and antenna will add no more than twenty feet (20) total to the
height of the existing structure;
c. The tower or antenna does not contain advertising; and
d. It complies with the lighting regulations for towers as specified in this
division.
(2) Freestanding antennas do not require a CUP in any nonresidential zoning
district if it does not exceed the height requirement(s) in the district and it meets
all other requirements of the district.
(c) Procedures. An application for a CUP for a tower, antenna, or use of an alternative
tower structure shall meet the procedural requirements set forth for a CUP contained
within Article 2, Division 3 of this Chapter 2.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-136
(d) Effects Not Considered. The effects of radio frequency emissions on persons or the
environment must not be considered in a proceeding involving an application for a
conditional use permit.
(e) Application & Requirements. An application for a conditional use permit for a
tower, antenna, or use of an alternative tower structure must be made to the
Planning Department. An application will not be considered until it is complete. A
complete application must contain the following:
(1) An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within the City or
within one mile of the corporate limits, specifying the location, height, and
design of each tower. The Planning Department may share the information
with other applicants for a conditional use permit under this article.
(2) Site plans to scale specifying the location of tower(s), transmission building and
other accessory uses, street access, parking, fences, landscaped areas, and
adjacent land uses.
(3) A report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the State of Texas
documenting the following:
a. Tower height and design, showing a cross-section of the tower structure.
b. Total anticipated capacity of the tower structure, including the number
and types of antennas that can be accommodated.
(4) A letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower and to lease additional
excess land on the tower site when the shared use potential of the tower is
absorbed, if structurally and technically possible.
(5) Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that
no existing towers could accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna by
doing the following:
a. The applicant must contact the owners of all existing towers of a height
roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the
applicant. A list must be provided of all owners contacted, the date of the
contact, and the form and content of the contact. Where an existing
tower is known to have capacity for additional antennas of the sort
proposed, that application for a new tower is not complete until the owner
of the existing tower responds, unless the applicant submits sufficient
information for the Planning Department to determine that all reasonable
efforts to obtain a response have been made and further efforts would be
futile.
b. The applicant must request the following information from each tower
owner contacted:
1. Identification of the site by location, existing uses, and tower
height.
2. Whether each tower could structurally accommodate the antenna
proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be
made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant
must provide each owner with the height, length, weight, and other
relevant data about the proposed antenna.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-137
3. Whether each tower could structurally accommodate the proposed
antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally
rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner must specify in general
terms what structural changes would be required.
4. If structurally able, would shared use by the existing tower be
precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner
must describe in general terms what changes in either the existing
or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the
proposed tower, if at all.
c. The Planning Department must maintain and provide, on request, records
of responses from each owner. Once an owner demonstrates an antenna
of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the
owner's tower as described below, the owner need not be contacted by
future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed.
d. Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared
use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the
existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The Planning Department
and the City Council may consider expert testimony to determine whether
the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed unreasonable.
(6) Any other information which may be requested by the Planning Department to
fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed
tower or antenna.
Secttiion 2..5..5..3 Generall Requiirementts & Regullattiions
(a) Advertising. No advertising shall be permitted on an antenna or tower.
(b) Signs or Illumination. No signs or illumination shall be placed on an antenna or
tower unless required by the FCC, FAA, or other state or federal agency of
competent jurisdiction. The Planning Department may review the available lighting
alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the
surrounding uses and views.
(c) Establishment. A new cell shall not be established if there is a technically suitable
space available on an existing tower within the search area that the new cell is to
serve. For the purpose of this article, the search area is defined as the grid for the
placement of the antenna.
(d) Location. A tower shall not be located in the required front yard in a residential
district.
(e) Tower Separation. All free-standing towers (not mounted on rooftops or alternative
tower structures) must conform to the following minimum tower separation
requirements contained in Table 2-1.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-138
Secttiion 2..5..5..4 Viisuall IImpactts
(a) Materials & Coloring.
(1) Towers must either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any
applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be
painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2) At a tower site, the design of the building and related structures must use
materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower
and facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and
supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that
is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure
so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as
possible.
(b) Height & Design.
(1) Towers clustered at the same site must be of similar height and design.
(2) Towers must be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing
similar tower supported antenna, and must be freestanding where the negative
visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower.
Secttiion 2..5..5..5 Priinciipall,, Accessory,, & Joiintt Uses
(a) Structures & Storage. Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower are
allowed, but such structures must not be used for offices, vehicle storage, or other
outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower
shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are
being made.
(b) Towers in Relation to a Principal Use. Towers may be located on sites containing
another principal use in the same buildable area. Towers may occupy a parcel
meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is
located. For a monopole tower, the minimum distance between the tower and any

other principal use located on the same lot shall be twenty percent (20%) percent of
the tower height or twenty-five feet (25), whichever is greater.
(c) More Than One Tower on One Site. Placement of more than one tower on a lot is
permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to
each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically
feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead
to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
Secttiion 2..5..5..6 Shared Use
(a) No Permit Required. To encourage shared use of towers, no conditional use permit
is required for the addition of antennas to an existing tower so long as the tower has
an approved conditional use permit, the height of the tower or structure on which the
antenna is placed is not increased and the requirements of this article are met.
(b) Tower Owner Responsibilities. Any conditional use permit which is granted for a
new tower is specifically subject to the condition that the tower owner abide by the
following provisions relating to shared use, regardless of whether or not the
ordinance granting the permit contains the conditions:
(1) The tower owner must respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request
for information from a potential shared use applicant;
(2) The tower owner must negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties;
and
(3) The tower owner must allow shared use where the third party seeking the use
agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all
charges necessary to make modifications of the tower and transmitters to
accommodate the shared use, and to observe whatever technical requirements
are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference.
(c) Compliance Required. The willful failure of an owner whose tower was approved
under this article to comply with the requirements of this section is grounds for
withholding approval of any application by the owner for a building permit for the
approved tower, for revoking the conditional use permit granted for the tower, and for
refusing to approve a new conditional use permit for any new tower or antenna.
Ord. No. 2000T-12, Section 2.5.5.6, June 28, 2010.
Secttiion 2..5..5..7 Abandoned Towers
(a)Not Operated for a Specific Period. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for
any continuous period of 12 months is deemed abandoned, whether or not the owner
or operator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned antenna
or tower and the owner of the property where tower is located must remove the tower
or antenna. If the antenna or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice
from the City ordering the removal, the City may remove tower or antenna and place
a lien upon the property for the costs of the removal.
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-140
(b) Use After Abandonment. If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to
use the abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all
applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if the tower or
antenna were a new tower or antenna.
Secttiion 2..5..5..8 Pre--Exiisttiing Towers & Non--Confformiing Uses..
(a) Operative Towers. All communications towers that are operative prior to the
effective date of this UDC and that do not comply wholly with the requirements of this
division are allowed to continue their present usage as a nonconforming use and are
treated as a non-conforming use in accordance with Chapter 2, Article 7 of this UDC.
Routine maintenance is permitted on the existing towers. Construction other than
routine maintenance on an existing communication tower must comply with the
requirements of this UDC.
Secttiion 2..5..5..9 Publliic Propertty
(a) Exempt. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise
controlled by a City, State, or Federal entity are not required to obtain a conditional
use permit under this division.

b. Where single-family and duplex lots have double frontage (frontage that
extends from one street to another), or are on a corner, a required front
yard shall be provided on both streets unless a side or rear yard building
line has been established along one frontage on the plat, in which event
only one required front yard need be observed (Figure 2-7).
c. The side and/or rear yards in the case of single-family and duplex uses
shall be identified and the front of the structure shall not face the side or
rear yard (Figure 2-8).

(4) Curved Front Building Line: Minimum lot widths for lots with predominate
frontage on the curved radius of a street (e.g., cul-de-sac or eyebrow portion
of a street) shall be measured as the linear distance of the curved front building
line (see Figure 2-11), and shall be shown on the Final Subdivision Plat. Lot
frontage shall not be less than eighty percent (80%) of the lot width, except on
cul-de-sac lots (see Figure 2-4) and knuckle lots. Lot widths for all lots shall be
as set forth in the respective zoning district for each lot.
(5) Front Yards in Relation to Pump Islands:

public street, the setback shall be thirty feet (30') (in order to prevent
vehicles stacking into the street).
c. Pump islands (and their canopies) may extend beyond the front building
line as described above (provided that all other requirements of this Code
are met), but shall not be closer than fifteen feet (15') to any property line
that is not adjacent to a public street.
(e) Yards in Relation to Future Rights-of-Way. Where a future right-of-way line has
been established for future widening or opening of a street or thoroughfare, upon
which a lot abuts, the front, side, and/or rear yard shall be measured from the future
right-of-way line.
(f) Side & Rear Yards.
(1) On a corner lot used for one or two-family dwellings, both street exposures
shall be treated as front yards on all lots platted after the effective date of this
Code, except that where one street exposure is designated as a side yard for
both adjacent lots or where the two lots are separated by an alley, street rightof-
way, creek/flood plain area, or other similar phenomenon. In such case, the
building line may be designated as a side yard of fifteen feet (15') or more (as
determined by the applicable zoning district standards) on the final plat. On
lots which were official lots of record prior to the effective date of this Code, the
minimum side yard adjacent to a side street shall comply with the minimum
required side yard for the respective district.
(2) Measuring Side/Rear Yards and Encroachments:
a. Every part of a required side yard shall be open and unobstructed except
for accessory buildings, as permitted herein, and the ordinary projections
of window sills, belt courses, cornices and other architectural features
projecting shall not exceed twelve inches (12) into the required side yard,
and roof eaves projecting shall not exceed twenty-four inches (24) into
the required side yard, except that no projections shall be permitted
closer than twelve inches (12) to a common property line.
b. Air conditioning compressors and similar accessory equipment are
permitted in the side or rear yard.
c. A canopy may project into a required side or rear yard provided that it is
not enclosed, and provided that it is at least five feet (5) from the

Page 2-149
adjacent property line. It also applies to any unenclosed extensions of a
roof.
d. Any attached patio cover sharing the roof line of the main structure that is
not fully enclosed may project into a required rear yard not closer than
50% of the required rear setback for the zoning district provided that it is
not encroaching any easement.
(g) Open Storage Areas. Open storage of materials, commodities or equipment, where
allowed in the specific zoning district, shall be located behind the front building line
and observe all setback requirements for the main structure or building. This
standard does not apply to outside display as defined in Chapter 5. Also refer to
screening requirements and special requirements for open storage in Chapter 4,
Article 2, Division 4 (Screening).
(h) Sight Visibility.
(1) Visual clearance shall be provided in all zoning districts so that no fence, wall,
architectural screen, earth mounding or landscaping thirty inches (30") or
higher above the street center line obstructs the vision of a motor vehicle driver
approaching any street, alley, or driveway intersection as follows:
a. At street intersections within nonresidential and mixed use zoning
districts, clear vision must be maintained for a minimum of twenty-five feet
(25') across any lot, measured from the corner of the property line in both
directions.
b. At street intersections within residential zoning districts, clear vision must
be maintained for a minimum of fifteen feet (15') across any lot, measured

Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-160
(a) Exceptions Criteria. Upon written request of the property owner, the Zoning Board
of Adjustment (ZBA) may grant special exceptions to the provisions of this code,
limited to and in accordance with the following:
(1) Expansion of a nonconforming use within an existing structure provided that, in
the case of a nonconforming residential use, such expansion does not increase
the number of dwelling units to more than the number existing when the use
first became nonconforming.
(2) Expansion of the gross floor area of a nonconforming structure or a conforming
structure on property that is conforming, provided that such expansion does not
decrease any existing setback.
(3) Re-construction of a nonconforming structure that has been totally destroyed,
or resumption of a nonconforming use previously abandoned, only upon finding
that the failure to grant the special exception deprives the property owner of
substantially all use or economic value of the land.
(4) Construction of a new structure on the same property where a nonconformity
already exists, whether it is a nonconformity in an existing structure or of the
property itself, provided the new structure assumes the existing nonconforming
status and no nonconforming use is expanded into the structure.
(5) In granting special exceptions under this Section 2.7.3.7, the ZBA shall avoid
doing so merely to allow a convenience or convey an advantage to the
applicant but instead shall endeavor to reduce the nonconforming nature of the
nonconforming use whenever possible and so may impose such criteria as are
necessary to bring the property into further compliance with this code, protect
adjacent property owners, and to ensure the public health, safety and general
welfare, including specifying the period during which the nonconforming use
may continue to operate or exist before having to conform to the standards of
this Code.
(b) The ZBA may grant special exceptions for the following:
(1) To interpret the provisions of this chapter in a way so as to carry out the intent
and purpose of this chapter, adjust districts where the street layout actually on
the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the maps.
(2) To reduce the parking and loading requirements in an amount not exceeding
thirty-three percent (33%) of the normal requirement in any of the districts
whenever the character or use of the building makes unnecessary the full
provision of parking or loading facilities, as contrasted with merely granting an
advantage or a convenience, as in the following situations:
a. Housing specifically designed and intended for use by the elderly,
disabled, or other occupants typically having a lower expectation of
automobile ownership;
b. Adaptive reuse or restoration of a historically or architecturally significant
structure;
c. Expansion of a nonprofit, public or social service use on an existing site;
and
Chapter 2: Zoning Regulations
Page 2-161
d. Conversion of a nonconforming use to what would otherwise be a
conforming use, except for the parking and loading requirements.
(3) To allow off-site parking where all or part of the minimum number of parking
spaces required in Chapter 4, Article 2, Division 1 (Parking) of this UDC are
located within three hundred feet (300) on a lot or tract of land that is legally
separate from the property containing the principal use served by the parking
area, provided that:
a. Both lots or tracts are under the same ownership; or
b. It can be established that two or more uses, applying jointly and
concurrently for the special exception, will be sharing a parking area that
may be on property that is not under the same ownership as one or more
of the uses to be served by the parking, where the shared parking area
has a capacity of at least the minimum number of spaces for the use
having the greatest minimum requirement, where all uses have their

arrangement is documented through a long-term lease or other written
agreement.
(4) To allow the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been
damaged to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost.
(5) To allow a change to another nonconforming use. If no structural alterations
are made, any nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises in
combination may, as a special exception, be changed to another
nonconforming use, provided the Zoning Board of Adjustment finds that the
proposed nonconforming use is not more nonconforming in the district than the
previously existing nonconforming use.
(6) To allow the City to issue a building permit for expansion of a preexisting
nonconforming use that is not in compliance with the Future Land Use Plan
Map and/or zoning district when the Zoning Board of Adjustment determines
that this special exception will not adversely impact water, wastewater,
drainage, and street transportation systems, and is in accord with all City codes
and applicable Comprehensive Plan policies, including those pertaining
specifically to land use compatibility.
(7)To allow for the reasonable reduction, to the minimal amount possible, of
requirements related to the following improvements to allow for compliance
with the Citys adopted requirements for development (and their spirit and
intent), but also to allow for the use and enjoyment of property within Pearland
(also see Article 1, Division 3 of Chapter 4 for triggers related to these
improvements):
a. Landscaping - As required within the applicable zoning district (Chapter
2) and/or in Chapter 4, Article 2, Division 2;
b. Screening/fencing - As required within the applicable zoning district
(Chapter 2) and/or in Chapter 4, Article 3, Division 4;
c. Façade requirements - As required within the applicable zoning district

(8) To allow for a reasonable amount of time for a nonconforming use to be
brought to a lesser-nonconforming status or to a conforming status by allowing
an applicant to make improvements to an existing, developed property or
building over a period of time, instead of requiring such improvements to be
made immediately, or prior to a Certificate of Occupancy.

requirements provided for herein, and shall be minimum requirements for the
platting and developing of subdivisions within the City of Pearland and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction, as authorized by State statute.
(2) The subdivision of land, as it affects a community's quality of life, is an activity
where regulation is a valid function of municipal government. Through the
application of these regulations, the interests of public and private parties are
protected by the granting of certain rights and privileges. By establishing a fair
and rational procedure for developing land, the requirements in this chapter

Secttiion 3..1..2..1 Purpose,, Applliicabiilliitty,, and Effffectt
(a) Purpose. The purpose of a Master Plan shall be to delineate the sequence and
timing of development within a proposed subdivision, where the tract to be
developed is part of a larger parcel of land owned or controlled by the applicant, in
order to determine compliance with the Citys Comprehensive Plan and the
availability and capacity of public improvements needed for the subdivision and the
larger parcel.
(b) Applicability.
(1) A Master Plan shall be required for any division of land where proposed
development of the tract is to occur in phases. A Master Plan may not be
accepted for filing if the land subject to the plat exceeds three hundred (300)
acres for single-family residential developments, or one hundred (100) acres
for other types of developments. Non-residential and residential mixed-use
developments shall not exceed four hundred (400) total acres. Phasing for the
Master Plan shall not exceed a time period of ten (10) years. The applicant
shall submit a schedule showing the proposed phasing of development that
shall be approved along with the Master Plan. If the land subject to the Master
Plan is part of a larger parcel, the remaining land shall be shown as a
remainder tract, but shall not be included within the Master Plan.
(2) Not more than one (1) Master Plan at a time shall be submitted for a phased
development. A previously submitted Master Plan and related Preliminary
Subdivision Plat or Preliminary Development Plat shall be approved prior to
any subsequent Master Plan application for a phased development.
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-12
(3) A Master Plan also shall be required for land in a Planned Development (PD)
zoning district or as part of a development agreement, and in either case, the
applicable amount of land may exceed the size limitations set forth in
Subsection (b)(1) above.
(c) Effect.
(1) Approval of a Master Plan authorizes the subdivider to submit a Preliminary
Subdivision Plat or Preliminary Development Plat application for each phase of
development shown on the plat, subject to the schedule of development
approved for the land.
(2) Once a Master Plan has been approved, all plats approved thereafter for the
same land shall be consistent with the Master Plat for so long as the Master
Plan remains in effect. Minor variations between the Master Plan and the
subsequent plat application(s) shall be permitted; however, in no case shall
minor variations be deemed to include any increase in the residential density,
number of units, building coverage or square footage, and/or impervious cover
of the proposed development.

approved unless all zoning amendments, including a request for a Planned
Development District, which are necessary to authorize the proposed uses have
been approved and remain in effect for the land included in the Master Plan. Where
applicable, approval of a Cluster Development Plan also is required prior to approval
of a Master Plan application. If the Cluster Development Plan includes details
regarding the phasing of the development, then no Master Plan will be required for
said development.
(d) Accompanying Applications.
(1) An application for a Master Plan may be accompanied by an application for
rezoning approval, including a request for a Planned Development District, or a
Cluster Development Plan, where applicable. The rezoning application and the
Cluster Development Plan shall be decided first. The applicant must execute a
waiver of the time period required for Master Plan approval.
(2) An application for a Master Plan may be accompanied by an application for
approval of a Preliminary Subdivision Plat or Preliminary Development Plat for
the first phase of the project, provided that the application for Master Plan shall
be decided first.

(1) The Master Plan is consistent with all zoning requirements for the property, and
any approved development agreement;
(2) The proposed provision and configuration of roads, water, wastewater,
drainage and park facilities are adequate to serve each phase of the
subdivision and generally meets the standards of this Chapter 3;
(3) The schedule of development is feasible and prudent, and assures that the
proposed development will progress to completion within the time limits
proposed; and
(4) If the land lies within a Planned Development (PD) zoning district or is subject
to a Cluster Development Plan, the proposed Master Plan conforms to the PD
or and is consistent with the incorporated Design Plan, or is consistent with the
approved Cluster Development Plan;
(5) The location, size and sequence of the phases of development proposed
assures orderly and efficient development of the land subject to the plat;
(6) Where the proposed development is located in whole or in part in the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City and is subject to an interlocal agreement
under Texas Local Government Code, Chapter 242, or is located within a
drainage district, the proposed Master Plan meets any county or drainage
district standards to be applied under the agreement or district rules.
(7) The Master Plan is consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan, except
where application of the Plan conflicts with state law.
(b) Conditions. In addition to any other conditions required to conform the plat to the

schedule of development approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The
subdivider shall submit and receive approval for a Preliminary Subdivision Plat or
Preliminary Development Plat, where applicable, for the first and all subsequent
phases of the Master Plan within the time limits prescribed in the approved phasing
schedule. Failure to meet a platting deadline included in the phasing schedule shall
result in the expiration of the Master Plan for that and all subsequent phases of the
subdivision. Expiration of the Preliminary Subdivision Plat, Preliminary Development
Plat, Final Subdivision Plat, or Final Development Plat for any phase of the Master
Plan shall result in the expiration of the Master Plan for all phases for which any type
of preliminary plat has not been approved.
(b) Extension. The expiration date for any phase of the development may be extended
by the Planning and Zoning Commission under Chapter 1, Article 2, Division 5.
Extension of the expiration date for the phase extends the expiration date for the
Master Plan for a like period. A Master Plat is not subject to reinstatement following
expiration.

Secttiion 3..1..2..6 Remaiinder Tractts
(a) Definition. A remainder tract is that portion of a larger parcel that is not included
within the boundaries of a subdivision plat. Remainder tracts shall not be considered
lots or tracts of the subdivision. Approval of a subdivision plat shall not constitute
approval of development on a remainder tract.
(b) Information accompanying a subdivision plat application for remainder tracts shall be
deemed to be an aid to the Planning and Zoning Commission in taking action on the
plat application and may be used to determine whether development of the land
subject to the plat will be adequately served by public facilities and services and is
otherwise in compliance with this Unified Development Code, taking into account the
development of the property as a whole. Information concerning remainder tracts,
including topography, drainage, and existing and planned public improvements, may
be considered in formulating conditions to approve the plat application. Based upon
such information, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require that additional
or less land be included in the subdivision plat in order to satisfy the standards
applicable to the plat application.

improvements to serve the subdivision or development have been proposed in
accordance with the City of Pearlands requirements, that all other requirements and
conditions have been met or planned for to allow the plat to be recorded, and to
assure that the subdivision or development meets all other standards of this Unified
Development Code to enable initiation of site preparation activities for any lot or tract
being platted.
The Development Plat is applicable for an integrated business development that
proposes a subdivision of any number of non-residential or multi-family residential
lots, that require extension of municipal facilities only to serve the specific
development being platted or platting of single lots, and where delay in construction

Page 3-41
(c) Mitigation of Development Impacts; Fair Share. The City desires to assure both
that development impacts are mitigated through contributions of rights-of-way,
easements and construction of capital improvements, and that a development project
contribute not more than its fair share of such costs.
Secttiion 3..2..2..2 Propertty Owners Oblliigattiion
(a) Dedication and Construction of Improvements. The property owner shall
dedicate all rights-of-way and easements for, and shall construct, capital
improvements within the rights-of-way or easements for those water, wastewater,
road or drainage improvements needed to adequately serve a proposed
development consistent with the applicable master facilities plans and construction
design standards, whether the facilities are located on, adjacent to or outside the
boundaries of the property being developed.
(b) Adjacent Road Improvements. In the case of adjacent or abutting roads, the City
may require that the entire right-of-way be dedicated and improved to City design
standards, depending on factors such as the impact of the development on the road,
the timing of development in relation to need for the road, and the likelihood that
adjoining property will develop in a timely manner. In the case of frontage or service
roads for state and federally designated highways, the entire abutting right-of-way
shall be dedicated and improved to applicable construction design standards.
(c) Reservation of Right-of-Way. The City may reserve the right-of-way along a
roadway designated in the Thoroughfare Plan, an approved collector plan or an
established capital improvement project located in the planning jurisdiction of the City
to protect a transportation corridor from development. The Director of Engineering
shall determine the alignment of reserved right-of-way based upon the Thoroughfare
Plan, collector plan or capital improvement project and engineering criteria, including
grade, curvature and the existence of a floodplain. In an area designated for a state
roadway project, the Texas Department of Transportation may establish alignment.
(d) Substandard Road Improvements. Where an existing road that does not meet the
City's right-of-way or design standards abuts a proposed development, the City may
require the property owner to dedicate the right-of-way for a standard width, and to
improve the street according to the dimensions and specifications in the applicable
thoroughfare plan, depending on factors such as the impact of the development on
the thoroughfare, the timing of development in relation to the need for the
thoroughfare, and the likelihood that adjoining property will develop in a timely
manner.
(e) Facilities Impact Studies. The City may require that a property owner prepare a
comprehensive traffic impact analysis, drainage study or other public facilities study
in order to assist the City in determining whether a proposed development will be
supported with adequate levels of public facilities and services concurrent with the
demand for the facilities created by the development. The study shall identify at a
minimum the adequacy of existing facilities and the nature and extent of any
deficiencies, and the capital improvements needed to meet the adopted level of
service assuming development at the intensity proposed in the development
application. The study shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer. The City
also may require, at the time of approval of a subordinate development application,
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-42
an update of a public facilities study approved in connection with a priority
development application.

portrays a specific plan of development, including but not limited to a petition for
establishing a Planned Development (PD) zoning district, or other overlay zoning
district; a petition for an annexation agreement or a development agreement; an
application for a Cluster Development Plan; an application for a Subdivision Master
Plat, or an application for a preliminary or final subdivision or development plat. As a
condition of approval of the development application, the City may require provision
for dedication of rights-of-way or easements for, and construction of, capital
improvements to serve the proposed development.
(b) Deferral of Obligation. The obligation to dedicate rights-of-way for or to construct
one or more capital improvements to serve a new development may be deferred until
approval of a subordinate development permit, or, in the case of a development
proposed to be developed in phases, until a subsequent phase of the development,
on the sole discretion of the City, upon written request of the property owner, or at
the Citys own initiative. As a condition of deferring the obligation, the City may
require that the developer enter into a capital improvements agreement pursuant to
Division 8 of Article 1 of this Chapter, specifying the time for dedication of rights-ofway
for or construction of capital improvements serving the development.
Secttiion 3..2..2..4 Relliieff From Oblliigattiions
(a) In order to achieve proportionality between the demands created by a proposed
development on public facilities and the obligation to provide adequate public
facilities, the City may participate in the costs of capital improvements in accordance
with this Article, credit or offset the obligations against payment of impact fees, or
relieve the property owner of some or part of the obligations in response to a petition
for relief from a dedication or construction requirement pursuant to Chapter 1.

(a) Improvement of Fair Share of an Adjacent Substandard Road. When an area
within a proposed subdivision or development plat, whether residential or
nonresidential, abuts on one or both sides of an existing substandard road or utility
facility, or a planned or future road or utility facility as shown on the Citys
Thoroughfare Plan and/or adopted plans related to water and wastewater, the
developer shall be required to improve its reasonable share of the road (including
appurtenant sidewalks, barrier-free ramps, storm drainage facilities, screening and
landscaping, median openings, left turn lanes, and water quality or erosion controls)
and utility facilities, to bring the facilities to City standards, or to replace them with
standard City road or utility facilities as determined by a traffic or other public
facilities impact study, if required, at no cost to the City.
(b) Calculation of Fair Share.
(1) The developers share of improvements to a substandard perimeter road is
twenty-two feet (22) of pavement (not including curb), or the equivalent of onehalf
of a primary collector street, along the entire front footage of the
subdivision.
(2) The developers share of improvements to a roadway when a subdivision is to
be located on both sides of a roadway is the full width of a primary collector
roadway, which is forty-four feet (44) of pavement, not including curbs. The
roadway shall be improved by the developer on each side of the road along the
entire length of the subdivision.
(3) The City shall participate in the costs of perimeter roads in excess of the
developers fair share obligations and where such costs are not borne by
another public entity, and in cases where the application of the standards in
this Section result in a disproportional burden on the development, as
determined in accordance by the City Council in accordance with Chapter 1,
Article 1, Division 4.
(c) Participation in Construction of Other Necessary Facilities. The developers
share for major bridges and similar region-serving drainage structures and for
railroad crossings (including the appurtenant roadway paving, sidewalks/pedestrian
pathways, abutments, safety railings and cross arms, median areas, etc.) shall be in
accordance with the City of Pearlands policies for the construction of such facilities.

(a) (b) Extension of Lines. Extension of water and wastewater lines shall be made
along the entire frontage of the subdivision or development plat adjacent to a street
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-45
or thoroughfare. If the subdivision is not adjacent to a thoroughfare, the extension of
utilities shall be accomplished in such a manner as to allow future connections to
said utilities by new subdivisions. If new subdivisions will never be constructed
beyond a developing subdivision due to physical constraints, the City Engineer may
waive the requirement for adjacent utility line construction at the time of final plat
approval and prior to construction of the subdivision.
(c) Compliance with Other Regulations. Installation, operations and maintenance of
utilities not specifically referenced herein shall comply with regulations of the TCEQ,
and with any other applicable State rules and regulations, whichever is the most
stringent requirement.
Ord. No. 2000T-12, Section 3.2.4.2, June 28, 2010.
Secttiion 3..2..4..3 IIndiiviiduall Welllls
(a) Within the ETJ. Individual wells within the ETJ shall be subject to approval by the
county health official, and this approval shall be documented by the health official's
signature on the water system statement on the plat. The developer must submit with
the plat application a certificate from a professional engineer registered in this state
or a geoscientist licensed to practice in this state verifying the adequacy of the
proposed source of well supply prior to plat approval.
(b) Compliance with Other Regulations. Installation, operations and maintenance of
individual wells shall comply with City standards, regulations of the TCEQ, any other
applicable State rules and regulations, and applicable regulations of any
groundwater conservation districts. In the event of conflict among these regulations,
whichever is the most stringent shall apply.
Secttiion 3..2..4..4 Centtrall Watter Systtems
(a) Design and Construction. All water facilities within a subdivision shall be designed
and constructed to City standards and to all state laws, policies, standards, rules and
regulations for an approved public water system, including those covering the
preparation, submittal and approval of plans and specifications for water systems
and acceptable operating practices, and in conformance with all laws, policies,
standards and rules and regulations for establishing the ISO rating of the City and
current fire codes of the City. The entire water system may not meet these
standards, but the part that serves the subdivision must meet these standards in
order to be approved by the City.
(b) Other Water Systems. For water systems other than the City system, the following
apply:
(1) If the water system that will serve a proposed development is not to be a part of
the City water system, the developer must submit with the application for
approval of the preliminary plat a current letter from the TCEQ certifying that
the public water system that will serve the subdivision is in compliance with
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-46
TCEQ rules and regulations. Plans and specifications for the subdivision's
water system that will be built to serve the subdivision shall be submitted as
part of the subdivision's construction plans.
(2) The developer must submit a letter from the TCEQ verifying that the public
water system proposed to serve the development holds a current valid
certificate of convenience and necessity (CCN) for the area proposed for
development. The letter must be accompanied by a map showing the
boundaries of the water system CCN in the vicinity of the development.
a. Standards May Be Met Upon Annexation - If a water system cannot meet
the standards of this Subsection, at the Planning and Zoning
Commission's discretion, the subdivision may be approved, if
arrangements have been made for an approved water system that will
meet City standards to serve the subdivision upon annexation by the City.
This shall be arranged by means of a mutually acceptable contract with
the City, unless a contract with another entity ensures compliance with
the technical requirements of this chapter, as determined by the City
Attorney.

flow. The use of lift stations is prohibited unless a gravity design is impractical. The
cost of installing all wastewater improvements to be made by the developer,
including off-site improvements, shall be included in the performance guarantees
furnished by the developer.
(b) Future Extension of Lines. Pipe stub-outs shall be located in manholes to facilitate
the future extension of wastewater lines. The City Engineer will determine the
location and size of the stub-outs.

Diiviisiion 6 -- Roadways
Secttiion 3..2..6..1 Confformance Wiitth Regullattiions and Ciircullattiion and Saffetty Needs
(a) Conformance With Plans and Regulations. The arrangement, character, extent,
width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the Citys Thoroughfare Plan
and the Citys Engineering Design Criteria Manual (EDCM), and shall be considered
in their relation to existing and planned streets or driveways (whether within the City
limits, the ETJ area, or adjacent municipal or county areas), to topographical
conditions, to public safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of
the land to be served by the streets. Reserve or residual strips of land controlling
access to or egress from other property, or to or from any street or alley, or having
the effect of restricting or damaging the adjoining property for subdivision purposes,
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-48
or which will not be taxable or accessible for improvements, shall not be permitted in
any subdivision unless they are required by the City in the public interest (such as to
enhance public safety or other public interest). All streets shall be constructed in
accordance with this section and with the Citys EDCM.
(b) Establishment of a Safe, Convenient and Functional System. Proposed streets
shall provide a safe, convenient and functional system for vehicular, bicycle and
pedestrian circulation, shall be properly related to the Thoroughfare Plan and any
amendments thereto, and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics
of each proposed subdivision or development. All streets shall be open and
unobstructed at all times.
Secttiion 3..2..6..2 Adequacy off Sttreetts and Thoroughffares
(a) Responsibility for Adequacy of Streets and Thoroughfares. The property owner
shall assure that the subdivision is served by adequate streets and thoroughfares,
and shall be responsible for the costs of rights-of-way and street improvements, in
accordance with the following policies and standards, and subject to the Citys cost
participation policies on oversized facilities.
(b) General Adequacy Policy. Every subdivision shall be served by improved streets
and thoroughfares adequate to accommodate the vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian
traffic to be generated by the development. Proposed streets shall provide a safe,
convenient and functional system for traffic circulation; shall be properly related to
the Citys Thoroughfare Plan, road classification system, Comprehensive Plan and
any amendments thereto; and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic
characteristics of each development.
(c) Road Network. New subdivisions shall be supported by a road network having
adequate capacity, ingress/egress, and safe and efficient traffic circulation. The
adequacy of the road network for developments of two hundred (200) or more
dwelling units, or for developments generating two thousand (2,000) or more "oneway"
trips per day, or for developments involving collector streets or thoroughfares
not appearing on the Citys adopted Thoroughfare Plan, shall be demonstrated by
preparation and submission, prior to or along with the preliminary plat application, of
a traffic impact analysis prepared in accordance with this Article 2, Division 8 (Traffic
Impact Analysis), which takes into consideration the need to accommodate traffic
generated by the development, land to be developed in common ownership and
other developed property.
(1) In the event the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a larger
development project, or constitutes a portion of the land to be ultimately
developed, the City Engineer may require a demonstration of adequacy
pursuant to this article for additional phases or portions of the property as a
condition of approval for the proposed preliminary plat.
(d) Approach Roads and Access. All subdivisions with sixty (60) or more lots must
have at least two points of vehicular access (primarily for emergency vehicles), and
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-49
must be connected with improved roadways to the Citys improved thoroughfare and
street system by one or more approach roads of the dimensions and standards
hereinafter set forth. Requirements for dedication of right-of-way and improvement
of approach roads may be increased depending upon the size or density of the
proposed development, or if the need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis.
(1) Points of vehicular access into subdivisions shall meet the requirements of the
Citys adopted Fire Code.
(2) The subdivision shall be designed to provide adequate emergency access for
public safety vehicles. Each residential lot in the subdivision shall have a
minimum frontage on a dedicated public street as required by applicable
zoning, or twenty-five feet (25), whichever is greater, unless other provisions
have been authorized through planned development approval. Each nonresidential
lot shall have a minimum frontage on a dedicated public street as
required by applicable zoning or fifty feet (50), whichever is greater, unless
other provisions have been authorized through planned development approval.
(e) Off-Site Improvements. Where traffic impact analysis demonstrates the need for
the facilities, or where the City believes public safety is at risk, the property owner
shall make improvements to off-site collector streets, thoroughfares, and
intersections necessary to mitigate traffic impacts generated by the development or
in conjunction with related developments. The City may participate in the costs of
oversize improvements with the property owner as set out herein, and subject to the
Citys cost participation policies on oversized improvements.
(f) Street Dedications.
(1) Dedication of Right-of-Way: The property owner shall provide all rights-ofway
required for existing or future streets, and for all required street
improvements, including perimeter streets and approach roads, as shown in
the Thoroughfare Plan and as required by the EDCM or by other valid
development plans approved by the City.
(2) Construction Easements: Construction easements, in addition to rights-ofway,
shall be required when adequate width for streets and/or utilities is not
available.
(g) Street Construction. All streets and thoroughfares shall be constructed and paved
to City standards and within rights-of-way as required by the Thoroughfare Plan and
this article, and in accordance with the EDCM and other City standards, as may be
from time to time amended or adopted.
(h) Intersection Improvements and Traffic Control Devices. Intersection
improvements and traffic control devices shall be installed as warranted in
accordance with the traffic impact analysis required by Article 2, Division 8 of this
Chapter, or as may be required by the City for traffic safety and efficiency.
Construction and design standards shall be in accordance with City standards and
the EDCM.
(i) Phased Development. Where a subdivision is proposed to be developed in phases,
the applicant, in conjunction with submission of the preliminary plat, shall provide a
schedule of development.
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-50
(j) Private Streets. In relation to private streets, the City will not assist in enforcing
deed restrictions. The City may periodically inspect private streets, and may
require any repairs necessary to ensure efficient emergency access and to protect
the public health, safety, convenience and welfare.
(1) Private Streets: Construction and Maintenance Cost: The City shall not pay for
any portion of the cost of constructing or maintaining a private street.
(2) Private Streets: Traffic Control Devices: All private traffic control devices and
regulatory signs shall conform to the Texas Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, as amended, and to City standards.
(3) Private Streets: Restricted Access: The subdivision homeowners association
shall clearly mark entrances to all private streets with a sign, placed in a
prominent and visible location, indicating that the streets within the subdivision
are private, and not maintained nor regularly patrolled by the City. All restricted
access entrances shall be manned 24 hours every day, or they shall provide a
reliable, alternative means of ensuring access into the subdivision by the City,
by emergency service providers, and by other utility or public service providers,
such as postal carriers and utility companies, with appropriate identification.
The method used to ensure City and emergency access into the subdivision
shall be approved by the Citys Fire Department and by any other applicable
emergency service providers. If the association fails to maintain reliable
access as required herein, the City may enter the private street subdivision and
remove any gate or device which is a barrier to access, and bill the expense to
the association. If the bill is not paid, the City may file a lien for the expense
against any property owned by the association.
(4) Private Streets: Waiver of Services: Certain City services may not be provided
for private street subdivisions. Among the services which may not be provided
are: routine law enforcement patrols, enforcement of traffic and parking
regulations, preparation of accident reports, and street lighting. Depending on
the characteristics of the development and access limitations posed by the
design of entrances into the subdivision, other services (such as sanitation)
may not be provided as well.
(5) Private Streets: Petition to Convert to Public Streets: The property owners
association may petition the City to accept private streets and any associated
property as public streets and right-of-way upon written notice to all association
members and upon the favorable vote of a majority of the membership.
However, in no event shall the City be obligated to accept the streets as public.
The City, as a condition of accepting a private street, may impose a
requirement either for repairs and improvements to a street at private expense
prior to acceptance, or a written agreement by all property owners along the
street to payment of a prorata assessment of the costs for repairs or
improvements to the street by the City prior to acceptance. The City shall be
the sole judge of the nature and extent of repairs or improvements needed.
The City may also require, at the associations or the lot owners expense, the
removal of any guard houses, access control devices, landscaping or other
aesthetic amenities located within the street or other common area prior to City
acceptance.
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-51
(6) Private Streets: Hold Harmless: The property owners association, as owner of
the private streets and appurtenances, shall release, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the City, any other governmental entity, and any public utility
entity for damages to the private streets that may be occasioned by the
reasonable use of the private streets by same, and for damages and injury
(including death) arising from the condition of the private streets, out of any use
of access gates or cross arms, or out of any use of the subdivision by the City
or governmental or utility entity.
Ord. No. 2000T-2, Section 3.2.6.2, February 26, 2007.
Secttiion 3..2..6..3 Escrow Polliiciies and Procedures
(a) Request for Escrow. Whenever this Unified Development Code requires a property
owner to construct a street or thoroughfare, or other type of public improvement, the
property owner may petition the City to construct the improvement at a later time, in
exchange for deposit of escrow as established in Subsection (b) below, if unusual
circumstances exist, such as a timing issue due to pending improvements by another
agency such as TxDOT or the county, that would present undue hardships or that
would impede public infrastructure coordination or timing. If more than one street or
thoroughfare must be constructed in order to meet adequacy requirements for
roadways, the City Engineer may prioritize roadways for which escrow is to be
accepted and require the deposit of all funds attributable to the development in
escrow accounts for one or more of the affected roadways. The City Engineer shall
review the particular circumstances involved and may require a traffic impact
analysis. The City Engineer shall determine whether or not provision of escrow
deposits will be acceptable in lieu of the property owners obligation to construct the
street or thoroughfare.
(b) Escrow Deposit With the City. Whenever the City Council agrees to accept
escrow deposits in lieu of construction by the property owner, the property owner
shall deposit in escrow with the City an amount equal to the owners share of the
costs of design, construction, permits, reviews and approvals, inspections, any
additional land acquisition, and an appropriate (and realistic) inflation factor to ensure
that the actual future dollar costs will be covered when actual construction occurs in
the future. This amount shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer, and
shall be paid prior to recording of the final plat. The obligations and responsibilities
of the property owner shall become those of the property owner's transferees,
successors and assigns; and the liability therefore shall be joint and several.
(1) Determination of Escrow Amount: The amount of the escrow shall be
determined by using comparable turnkey costs for construction of the
improvements (including design, permits, reviews and approvals, inspections
and any additional land acquisition that may be needed). The determination of
the escrow amount shall be made as of the time the escrow is due hereunder,
and shall be subject to the review and approval of the City Engineer.
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-52
(2) Termination of Escrow: Escrows, or portions of escrowed amounts, which have
been placed with the City under this section and which have been held for a
period of ten years from the date of such payment or agreement, in the event
that the City has not authorized the preparation of plans and specifications for
construction of such roadway facilities for which the escrow was made, shall,
upon written request, be returned to the property owner or applicant who
originally paid the escrow amount, along with one-half of its accrued interest.
Such return does not remove any obligations of the property owner for
construction of the required facilities if a building permit has not been issued on
the subject lot(s) or if application for a new building permit(s) is made.
(3) Refund: If any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed
by a party other than the City, or is reconstructed by another governmental
authority at no cost to the City, the escrowed funds and accrued interest shall
be refunded to the property owner or applicant who originally paid the escrow
amount after completion and acceptance of the public improvements. In the
event that a portion of the cost is borne by the City and the other portion of the
cost by another party or governmental authority, the difference between the
property owner's actual proportionate cost and the escrowed funds, including
accrued interest, if any, shall be refunded after completion and acceptance of
the improvements.
(4) Interest Limitation: If money is refunded within six months of deposit, only the
principal will be refunded. Monies returned after this date will be refunded with
one-half of its accrued interest.
Secttiion 3..2..6..4 Speciiffiic Sttreett Sttandards
(a) EDCM Standards Met. In addition to the requirements of the Engineering Design
Criteria Manual (EDCM), the requirements of the street standards in this Section
shall be met.
(b) Arrangement of Streets Not Shown on the Thoroughfare Plan. For streets that
are not shown on the Citys Thoroughfare Plan, such as local residential streets, the
arrangement of such streets within a subdivision shall:
(1) Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets or
street stubs from or into surrounding areas  every twelve hundred feet
(1,200), there shall be a projection that would allow for such continuation;
(2) Conform to any plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the City to
meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make
continuance or conformity to existing streets impractical;
(3) Provide for future access, such as by stubbing streets for future extension, to
adjacent vacant areas which will likely develop under a similar zoning
classification or for a similar type of land use; and
(4) Not conflict in any way with existing or proposed driveway openings
(including those on the other side of an existing or planned median-divided
thoroughfare, in which case new streets shall align with such driveway
openings such that median openings can be shared).
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-53
(c) Discouragement of Through Traffic on Residential Streets. Residential collector
streets and local residential streets shall be laid out such that their use by cut
through traffic will be discouraged, with the development of a hierarchical street
system and such measures as circuitous routes or multiple turns or offsets, but such
that access is provided to adjacent subdivisions.
(d) Transitions of Right-of-Way Width. Wherever the right-of-way width of a
residential local or collector street must transition to a greater or lesser width, the
transition shall not occur within an intersection but within the street right-of-way so
that the right-of-way shall be the same on both sides of the street intersection.
(e) Residential Subdivisions Abutting or Containing Streets Classified as Major or
Minor Thoroughfares. Where a residential subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or proposed street which is or will be classified as a major or minor
thoroughfare, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require measures to
provide adequate protection of the residential properties and create separation of
through traffic from local traffic. These measures may include marginal access
streets, shared access driveways, reverse or double-lot frontage (lots which back on
the a major or minor thoroughfare or major collector), or deep lots with rear service
alleys. Where a lot is allowed direct access to a street classified as a major collector
or major or minor thoroughfare, said lot shall be greater than one acre in area, have
a shared access drive with the adjoining lot(s) if the lot has less than four hundred
feet (400') of frontage, and require the approval of the City Engineer. Lots which
existed in their present configuration prior to February 27, 2006 may be exempted at
the discretion of the City Engineer. Direct access to a thoroughfare from a
residential lot shall be prohibited unless the lot is in an existing subdivision and has
no frontage or other means of access to another road.
(f) Reserve Strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is required by the City and approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
(g) Configuration Shall Reduce Minimal Offsets. Intersecting streets onto an
existing or future divided roadway must be configured such that the centerline offset
will accommodate the appropriate median opening and left-turn lanes (with required
transition and stacking distances) on each divided roadway, and shall be aligned with
any existing or proposed streets or driveways on the opposite side of the divided
roadway (in order to share the median opening).
(h) Intersections. A street intersection with a classification of secondary thoroughfare
or above shall be at a ninety degree (90?) angle and shall be tangent to the
intersecting street for at least one hundred feet (100). All other street intersections
shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at a ninety degree (90?)
angle or radial to the centerline of the intersecting street for the full right-of-way width
of the intersecting street, and tangent to the intersecting street for at least fifty feet
(50). No street shall intersect at an angle that is less than eight-five degrees (85?).
(i) Right-of-Way Widths. Street right-of-way widths shall be as shown on the
Thoroughfare Plan and as defined by the corresponding roadway cross-sections on
the Thoroughfare Plan and in the Citys EDCM.
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-54
(j) Half Streets. Construction of half streets shall be prohibited, except when essential
to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conforming with the other
requirements of this Code and the Thoroughfare Plan, and where the Planning and
Zoning Commission makes a determination that there is no immediate benefit to be
gained by constructing the full street section since no access from the street will be
needed by the subdivision in question. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
also find that it would be more practical, or cost effective, to delay construction of the
other half of a street until when the adjoining property is developed.
(k) Maximum Length of a Block or Street Segment. The maximum length of any
proposed block or street segment (including a looped street) shall be twelve hundred
feet (1,200), except sixteen hundred feet (1,600) shall be permitted along major
thoroughfares, and the minimum length of any proposed block or street segment
shall be six hundred feet (600), as measured along the street centerline and
between the point(s) of intersection with other through streets (i.e., not dead-end
streets or cul-de-sacs). Where no existing subdivision or topographical constraints
control, the blocks shall not be less than 600 feet in length. However, in cases
where physical barriers, nature of development, or property ownership creates
conditions where it is appropriate that these standards be varied, the length may be
increased or decreased at plat approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission to
meet the existing conditions having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of
traffic and public safety.
(l) Maximum and Minimum Length of a Cul-De-Sac Street. A cul-de-sac, or
approved turn-around, shall not be required for streets less than one hundred fifty
feet (150') in length and with no more than four (4) lots with frontage on each side of
that street upon determination by the City that there will be no adverse impact on
circulation of traffic and public safety. Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed six
hundred feet (600') in length. The closed end of a residential cul-de-sac street shall
have a cul-de-sac bulb with an outside pavement diameter of at least eighty feet (80')
and a right-of-way diameter of at least one hundred feet (100'). The closed end of a
non-residential cul-de-sac streets shall have a cul-de-sac bulb with an outside
pavement diameter of a least ninety feet (90') and a right-of-way diameter of one
hundred feet (100'). The length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured from the
centerline of the street intersection to the centerline of the cul-de-sac bulb.
Alternatives to cul-de-sac bulb may be accepted by the City Engineer when a
hardship exists.
(1) Exception: Dead-end streets with a turn-around may be extended to a
maximum length of one thousand two hundred feet (1,200) if platted and
constructed with a minimum right-of-way of sixty feet (60) and a pavement
width of thirty-six feet (36), measured from back-of-curb to back-of-curb), or if
an acceptable all-weather emergency access street fitted with a key box is
provided at the end of the cul-de-sac turnaround. All roadway and property
line diameters referenced above shall apply.
(m) Allowance for Overlength Streets or Cul-De-Sacs. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may approve overlength streets or cul-de-sacs up to seven hundred
and fifty feet (750) in length, whether temporary or permanent, upon considering the
following:
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-55
(1) If there are alternative designs that are feasible and that would, if used, reduce
the proposed overlength street or cul-de-sac;
(2) The effect of overlength streets upon access, congestion, delivery of municipal
services, and upon convenience to residents of the subdivision in traveling to
and from their homes; and
(3) Means of mitigation, including but not limited to additional mid-block street
connections, limitation on the number of lots to be served along an overlength
street segment or cul-de-sac, temporary (or permanent) points of emergency
access, and additional fire protection measures.
(4) Whether the allowance of such overlength street or cul-de-sac preserves the
spirit and intent of these regulations.
(5) Recommendation of the City Engineer.
(n) Dead-End Streets. Except when recommended by the City Engineer, no public
dead-end streets will be approved unless they are provided to connect with existing
streets (including stubbed-out streets) or future platted streets on adjacent land.
(1) In the case of dead-end streets which will eventually be extended into the
adjacent property, no more than one lot (per side) can front onto the dead-end
street stub unless a temporary turnaround bulb (with the appropriate temporary
street easement) is provided at the end.
(2)A temporary dead-end street shall not exceed the maximum allowed length of a
normal cul-de-sac, and the temporary turnaround bulb must be constructed like
a cul-de-sac, as provided in Subsection (l) above.
(3)A note shall be placed on the final plat clearly labeling any temporary dead-end
streets (if any) that will at some point be extended into the adjacent property,
and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street stub, such as
on the barricade, also stating that the street may be and is intended to be
extended in the future. Signage and lettering must be large enough to be
legible by a person with normal vision at a fifty-foot (50) distance. Any
required temporary turnaround easements shall be shown on the final plat
along with their appropriate recording information, if they are off-site or
established by separate instrument.
(4) No dead-end private street shall extend further than seven hundred feet (700)
for multiple-family developments.
(5) Permanent streets one hundred and fifty feet (150') or less in length (measured
from centerline of intersecting through street to end of paving) may be platted
as dead-end streets if no more than four (4) lots on each side adjoin the

Secttiion 3..2..10..1 Parklland Dediicattiion & Fees
(a) Areas for Public Use.
(1) Application: This division shall apply to areas inside the City limits and the
Citys ETJ.
(2) Suitable Sites; Area(s) Indicated on Submittals: The applicant shall give
consideration to suitable sites for parks, playgrounds and other areas for public
use so as to conform with the recommendations of the Citys adopted Parks
Plan, as amended.
a. Any provision for parks and public open space areas shall be indicated on
the construction drawings and final plat, and shall be subject to a
recommendation by the Park Director and approval by the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
b. Suitable park sites include those that can be used for active recreation
(such as playgrounds and areas for organized sports) and passive
recreation (such as hiking and picnic areas) as defined and discussed
within the Citys adopted Parks Plan, as amended.
(3) Permit Required for Park Site Manipulation: No individual, partnership, firm, or
corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reroute or change the course or location of
any existing ditch, channel, stream or drainageway proposed for a park without
first obtaining written permission of the City and any other agency having
jurisdiction.
(b) Parkland Dedication.
(1) Generally: The City of Pearland has determined that recreational areas in the
form of public parks and open spaces are necessary for the well being of the
residents of the City. The City has further determined that a reasonable
connection exists between the subdivision of residential property and the need
for additional parkland to serve new residents of the community. It is the intent
of this section, therefore, to require a reasonable method for the dedication of
public parkland, or the payment of a fee in lieu of property dedication, that is
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-59
directly related to the need for high quality park land and open space sites for
the use and enjoyment of the citizens of Pearland.
(2) Criteria for Land Dedication: All residential subdivisions, regardless of type,
shall be required to dedicate suitable land for park or open space development
in the amount of one (1) acre per fifty (50) units or lots, whichever results in a
greater dedication.
(3) Calculation: Residential units shall be calculated based on the actual number
of single-family, duplex and townhouse lots platted in the subdivision. Multiplefamily
and condominium units shall be calculated on the maximum allowed
density of the zoning district in which the lot is located. If the subdivision is
located outside of the City limits, multiple-family units shall be calculated at the
rate of 24 dwelling units per acre, and condominium units shall be calculated at
the rate of 12 dwelling units per acre, unless deed restrictions are filed
restricting the property to a lesser density.
(4) Exemption from dedication requirements: Parkland dedication requirements
shall not apply to either the subdivision of commercial, industrial or other nonresidential
lots, or to the replatting of previously platted residential lots, where
such lots were subject to parkland dedication requirements at the time of the
prior subdivision. If a replat or amending plat is filed that increases the number
of dwelling units from the previous plat, the park dedication requirement shall
apply to the additional dwelling units.
(5) Criteria for Park and Open Space Dedication: Land dedicated for parks or open
spaces shall be appropriate for the intended purpose. The following criteria
shall apply to land proposed for parkland or open space dedication:
a. At least fifty percent (50%) of the parkland that is required to be dedicated
(based on the previously described calculation) shall be acceptable in
terms of design, location, etc., for use as an area of active recreation.
b. Drainage ditches, power line easements, pipeline easements, and similar
sites shall not be accepted for parkland dedication, unless the Planning
and Zoning Commission finds, after consultation with the Director of
Parks and Recreation, that the land has exceptional recreational value
that warrants its acceptance as parkland or open space. If this finding is
made, such areas may account for a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of
the parkland dedication.
c. Detention/retention facilities may be accepted for parkland dedication
when the Planning and Zoning Commission finds, after consultation with
the Director of Parks and Recreation, that the facilities have been
incorporated into the design of the development as an amenity, such as a
lake or pond. The term amenity is defined within Chapter 5 of this UDC.
d. The dedication of land within the 100-year floodplain may be acceptable,
provided the land consists of the native floodplain that is unaltered by
channelization or other man-made stormwater control facilities.
e. All parkland and open space dedication shall be consistent with the goals,
objectives and policies of the Citys adopted Park Plan (as amended).
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-60
f. The parkland shall be located in the same park benefit zone as the
subdivision fulfilling the park donation requirement.
g. The parkland shall be clearly visible to public safety vehicles and the
neighborhood residents.
h. Pedestrian or vehicular access to the parkland shall be available from one
(1) or more streets. Street frontage shall be required to ensure public
access to the parkland and adequate on-site parking, if appropriate.
i. The parkland shall be of suitable width, depth, topography and size to
permit he development and/or construction of facilities listed herein and
as described in the adopted Parks Plan. This requirement may vary from
subdivision to subdivision depending upon the specific need being served
by the dedication.
j. Potable water, sanitary sewer, and electrical power shall be readily
available to the parkland from an adjacent street right-of-way or public
utility easement.
k. The parkland shall be free of easements, pipelines, overhead utilities, and
other conditions which prohibit the effective use of the property as a
neighborhood park.
l. The subdivider shall remove all dead tress, trash, refuse, and water
materials from the dedicated parkland prior to its acceptance.
m. The parkland shall have adequate drainage as determined by the City
Engineer, who shall review all construction plans for any detention or
retention proposed to be built on the property.
(6) Fee in lieu of Dedication: A cash fee for the purchase of offsite parkland may
be paid in lieu of all or part of the dedication of onsite parkland. The cash fee
in lieu of parkland dedication shall be set by resolution of the City Council. All
fees in lieu of dedication shall be paid prior to the recordation of the final plat or
prior to the issuance of a building permit where a plat is not required. Fees in
lieu of dedication may be accepted if either of the following conditions apply:
a. If requested by the subdivider, and reviewed by the Director of Parks and
Recreation, the Planning and Zoning Commission may allow the option of
the payment of a fee over the dedication of land within the subdivision; or
b. If the Director of Parks and Recreation recommends to the Planning and
Zoning Commission that land proposed for dedication by the subdivider is
either unsuitable for parkland due to its size or general physical
characteristics, or the proposed dedication is not consistent with the
goals, policies and objectives of the Citys adopted Parks Plan, as
amended.
(7) Park Benefit Areas/Zones: The City shall establish a separate parkland and
open space account. The funds in the account shall be earmarked solely for
the acquisition and development of parkland either in the same park benefit
area in which the subdivision is located, or for regional parks and open space
that will benefit all of the citizens of Pearland. The City shall expend cash
contributions within ten (10) years of the date any such contribution is made.
(8) Parkland Conveyance:
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-61
a. Land proposed for dedication as public parkland or open space shall be
designated on the final plat and shown as Parkland dedicated to the City
of Pearland. The acreage of the land included in the dedication shall
also be shown on the plat. All land designated as parkland shall be
included in a separate reserve area, or multiple reserve areas, that are
shown on the plat.
b. Park and recreation facilities in the City shall be dedicated to the City.
Park and recreation facilities in the Citys ETJ shall be dedicated to the
City. If the City does not wish to accept the dedication of public parkland
in its ETJ, it shall be dedicated to the county, municipal utility district, or a
homeowners association (as defined), subject to acceptance by such
entity.
c. The subdivider shall be obligated to provide survey corner markers at the
corners of all parkland reserve areas in accordance with the standards
set forth in this Article, Division 14.
(9) Method of Park Dedication: The proper method of park dedication for a
subdivision subject to the park dedication requirement shall be determined by
the City prior to the approval of the Final Subdivision Plat, and shall be based
upon the size of the subdivision, as follows:
a. 500 Dwelling Units or More  The Final Subdivision Plat of any
subdivision subject to this division of the UDC that establishes five
hundred (500) or more dwelling units shall include dedication of land to
the City for zone parks and neighborhood park purposes. Such
dedication shall be at the rate of one (1) acre of land per each fifty (50)
dwelling units on the Final Subdivision Plat.
b. 50 to 499 Dwelling Units  For any subdivision subject to this division of
the UDC that establishes fifty (50) to four hundred and ninety-nine (499),
the City Council, in consultation with the Park Director, shall have the sole
discretion to accept either a dedication of land on the Final Subdivision
Plat at the above rate, or to require payment of cash in lieu thereof in the
amount provided by Subsection (b)(6) above.
c. Fewer than 50 Dwelling Units  The City declares that development of a
park less than one (1) acre in size is impractical and creates
unreasonable and unnecessary maintenance and operating expenditures.
Therefore, if the proposed subdivision contains fewer than fifty (50)
dwelling units, the subdivider shall be required to pay cash in lieu thereof
in the amount provided by Subsection (b)(6) above. No plat showing a
dedication of less than one (1) acre shall be approved unless the
dedicated property may reasonably be developed in conjunction with
adjacent park property.
(10) Excess Open Space: A subdivider may satisfy up to ten percent (10%) of the
park dedication requirement on an acre for acre basis by exceeding the open
space requirement for the subdivision by at least thirty percent (30%).
(11)Improvements to Existing Park Sites: Construction of improvements to existing
public park sites or neighborhood recreational facilities located within the same
park benefit zone as the subdivision fulfilling the park dedication requirement,
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-62
may satisfy up to fifty percent (50%) of the subdivisions park dedication
requirement, subject to the following conditions.
a. Such improvements shall be constructed in accordance with a Site Plan.
The Site Plan shall include, at a minimum, a topographic element
including proposed grading, landscaping and beautification elements, site
facilities, recreation facilities, and existing and proposed utilities. The Site
Plan shall be drawn at a scale of one inch (1) to twenty feet (20) (or
other suitable scale). All approved improvements shall be designed in
compliance with the EDCM standards applicable to such improvements.
Additionally, the subdivider shall include details related to materials,
equipment, methods of construction, warranties, assurances, and
indemnifications. All proposed improvements shall be subject to the
approval of the Citys Parks Director.
b. The Site Plan shall be approved by the Citys Parks Director prior to the
filing of the Final Subdivision Plat.
c. Improvements proposed in the Site Plan may fall into any of the following
park improvement categories. A subdivider may satisfy up to ten percent
(10%) of the park dedication requirement for each category of
improvements that are constructed, up to a maximum of fifty percent
(50%). Any improvements proposed by the subdivider, but not included
in this list, and/or any improvements which are deemed unnecessary at
the site, may be rejected by the City. In addition, the Citys Parks Director
may approve the provision of any improvement not shown on this list if
such improvement is in compliance with the findings and
recommendations of the Parks Plan.
1. Handicapped accessible playgrounds, with approved equipment,
benches, and/or picnic tables;
2. Practice athletic fields and courts for volleyball, basketball, and/or
tennis;
3. Swimming Pools;
4. Natural open space consisting of at least five (5) acres of useable
natural habitat, approved by the Director of Parks and Recreation,
and exclusive of subdivision entry ways and open space counted for
the credit allowed in (10) above;
5. Lakes with recreational amenities such as boat docks and/or fishing
piers;
6. Multi-purpose trails and walkways;
7. A trail connection at least eight feet (8) wide for public use that links
the subdivision to the Citys hike and bike trail.
d. All improvements constructed pursuant to this division of the UDC are
subject to final acceptance by the Parks Director. If any or all of the
improvements are deemed unacceptable, the subdivider shall make up
that portion of the park donation requirements that would have been
satisfied by the unacceptable improvements by payment of a cash
donation prior to the final acceptance of the subdivision by the City.
(12) Expenditure of Collected Funds:
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-63
a. Special Fund - There is hereby established a special fund for the deposit
of all sums paid in lieu of parkland dedication under this division of the

the City within ten (10) years from the date received by the City for
acquisition and/or development of City parks. Such funds shall be
considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis. If not so expended,
the subdivider or the owner of the subdivision on the last day of such
period shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of such sum, computed on a
square footage or area basis. The owners of such property must request
such refund within one (1) year of entitlement, in writing, or such right
shall be forfeited.

(a) Easements for New Development.
(1) For new development, all necessary on-site easements shall be established on
the Final Subdivision Plat or Final Development Plat and not by separate
instrument, and they shall be labeled for the specific purpose, and to the
specific entity if other than the City, for which they are being provided. Such
easements may be permitted to be established by separate instrument only in
limited circumstances, and only if requested by the entity providing services
with the easement, and only if permitted by the City Engineer.
(2) The ownership, maintenance, and allowed uses of all designated easements
shall be stated on the plat. Examples include, but are not limited to, the
following: a water, wastewater or drainage easement, which is dedicated to the
City for a water or wastewater line or for a drainage structure; an access
easement, which is dedicated to the public for unrestricted access purposes; a
fire lane easement, which is dedicated to the City and fire suppression and
emergency medical service providers for access purposes; and an electrical,
gas or communications easement, which is dedicated to the specific utility
provider that requires the easement; and so on.
(b) Encroachments. No structure or equipment shall be placed within any easement
dedicated pursuant to this chapter unless the person or entity wishing to place such
structure or equipment has first obtained written consent to encroach from all holders
of the right to use said easement. A wall, fence or screen shall be permitted over
any utility easement only if approved by the City Engineer and provided that the
easement remains fully accessible to the City for maintenance and repair purposes.
A wall, fence or screen shall be permitted over any drainage easement if the water
flow within the easement is not adversely affected by the wall, fence or screen. In
addition to all other remedies provided by Chapter 1, Article 2, Division 6 of this
Unified Development Code, the City may summarily remove any wall, fence or
screen erected in violation of this section, and the City shall not incur any liability or
assume any duty to compensate the owner or replace the wall, fence or screen.

(b) Streets. Intersecting streets, which determine the lengths and widths of blocks, shall
be provided at such intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately, to provide
adequate fire protection, and to conform to customary subdivision practices.
Ord. No. 2000T-12, Section 3.2.14.1, June 28, 2010.
Secttiion 3..2..14..2 Lotts -- Dettermiinattiion and Regullattiion off Siize
(a) Zoning District Requirements, If Applicable. Lots shall conform to the minimum
requirements of the established zoning district, if located within the Citys corporate
limits.
(b) General Shape and Layout. The size, width, depth, shape and orientation of lots,
and the minimum building setback lines shall be designed to assure the adequate
provision of public facilities and the purpose of these subdivision regulations (within
this Chapter 3 of the UDC), taking into consideration the location and size of the
subdivision and the nature of the proposed uses.
(c) Irregularly-Shaped Lots. Irregularly-shaped lots shall have sufficient width at the
building line to meet lot width and frontage requirements of the appropriate zoning
district (if within the Citys limits), and shall provide a reasonable building pad without
encroachment into front, side or rear yard setbacks or into any type of easement.
Also, the rear width shall be sufficient to provide access for all necessary utilities,
including access for driveways and solid waste collection when alleys are present
(minimum 20-foot alley frontage). In general, triangular, severely elongated (in
excess of a 3 to 1 depth to width ratio) or tapered, or flag lots shall be not be
permitted, except as provided in Section 2.6.1.1 (b) (1). Lot depth and width shall be
measured as shown in Chapter 2, Figure 2-4, The City reserves the right to
disapprove any lot which, in its sole opinion, will not be suitable or desirable for the
purpose intended or which is so oddly shaped as to create a hindrance to the logical
lot layout of surrounding properties.
(d) Side Lot Line Configuration. Side lot
lines shall be at ninety degree (90 ) angles
or radial to street right-of-way lines to the
greatest extent possible. The City
reserves the right to disapprove any lot
which, in its sole opinion, is shaped or
oriented in such a fashion as to be
unsuitable or undesirable for the purpose
intended, or which is not attractively or
appropriately oriented toward its street
frontage.
(e) Double Frontage Lots. Double frontage
lots shall be avoided, except where they
may be essential to provide separation of
residential development from major
thoroughfares, or to overcome a specific
Figure 3-1: Types of Lots
Chapter 3: Subdivision Regulations
Page 3-69
disadvantage or hardship imposed by topography or other factors. Where lots have
double frontage, are not screened, and/or are provided access directly onto a major
thoroughfare, building setback lines shall be established for each street side, and
rear yard screening shall be provided in accordance with Chapter 4, Article 2,
Division 4. Residential lots shall not back onto any residential street or collector
street within a residential area or neighborhood, provide direct access onto a major
collector or major or minor thoroughfare except as provided by Section 3.2.6.4, or
have more than one-half of its perimeter boundaries along streets.
(f) Extra Depth and Width in Certain Cases. Additional depth shall be required by the
Planning and Zoning Commission when a lot in a residential area backs up to a
railroad right-of-way, a high pressure gasoline, oil or gas pipeline, an electric
transmission line (69 kv or higher), a thoroughfare, an industrial area, or other land
use that has a depreciating effect on the residential use of the property and where no
marginal access street or other street is provided at the rear of the lot. A depth in
excess of 140 feet shall not be required. Where a lot sides to any of the uses listed in
this subsection, additional width shall be required by the Commission, but a width in
excess of 75 feet shall not be required.
(g) Lots Adjacent To or In Floodplains. Subdivision of property in a designated
floodplain must meet the requirements for floodplain management in the Citys
adopted Flood Hazard Prevention Ordinance and/or Chapter 30 of the City Code, as
applicable.
(h) Landscaping and Buffering. The design of lots shall take into consideration the
requirements of Chapter 4 pertaining to landscaping and buffering, specifically in
situations where the subdivision will be adjacent to areas of different land uses or
when residential densities or different land uses or various residential densities will
be developed within the subdivision.
(i) Building Lines. Front building lines shall be shown for all lots on all plats submitted
for land within the Citys ETJ.
(j) Access. Each lot shall have access to a public street or a private street built to city
standards by direct frontage on such street. The minimum required frontage of a lot
shall be equal to the minimum lot width allowed for the zoning district in which the lot
is located. The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve a minor subdivision
plat containing lots that do not have frontage on a public street, as long as such lots:
(1) are pre-existing and the plat does not include a division of land that creates
any new lots lacking frontage on a public street.
(2) have existing access to a public street via not more than one (1) permanent,
valid access easement that is:
a. recorded in the county real property records;
b. appurtenant to (runs with) the land;

Secttiion 4..1..1..1 Purpose & Applliicabiilliitty
(a) Purpose: This Section establishes a review process for all types of development,
except single-family in a platted subdivision. The purpose of a Site Plan is to ensure
that a development project is in compliance with all applicable City ordinances and
guidelines prior to commencement of construction. Approval of the Site Plan is
required prior to site construction.
1. Exemptions & Exceptions: Site plan review shall not be required for singlefamily
detached or two-family residential developments, unless the proposed
subdivision will include a private amenity or facility comprised of one or more
buildings (such as a private recreation/swimming facility, clubhouse, etc.) or a
golf course, or unless the proposed subdivision will have private (not public)
streets. In these instances, Site Plan submission and approval will be
required for the private amenity or facility, the golf course
clubhouse/hospitality area, and the gated (restricted access) entrances.
(b) Applicability: Submission and approval of a Site Plan shall be required for all
nonresidential (including churches, schools, etc. within residential areas), Old
Townsite, mixed-use, townhouse, single-family attached, and multi-family residential
projects. The Planning Director shall be the responsible official for processing of a
Site Plan.
1. Building Permit Issuance: Site plans shall be submitted prior to or in
conjunction with a building permit application. No building permit shall be
issued until a Site Plan, if required, and all other required
engineering/construction plans are first approved by the City. No certificate
of occupancy shall be issued until all construction and development conforms
to the Site Plan and engineering/construction plans, as approved by the City.
(c). Extent of Area That Should Be Included In a Site Plan: When the overall
development project is to be developed in phases, the Site Plan area shall include
only the portion of the overall property that is to be developed/constructed.
Secttiion 4..1..1..2 Submiissiion & Conttentts
(a) Procedures & Submission Requirements For Site Plan Approval:
Submission of an application for Site Plan approval shall be preceded by a preapplication
conference with the City (see Section 1.2.1.5). To ensure the
submission of adequate information, the City is hereby empowered to maintain
and distribute a separate list of specific requirements for Site Plan review
applications. All applications and related contents shall be submitted
consistent with these requirements, a checklist of which shall be supplied by
the Planning Department.
Secttiion 4..1..1..3 Reviiew,, Approvall,, Appeall & Reviisiions
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-5
(a) Review & Approval of a Site Plan:
(1) City Staff Review & Approval of Site Plans: Upon official submission of a
complete application of a Site Plan for approval, the Director of Planning, or
his/her designee, and the Building Official, or his/her designee shall review the
development proposal in terms of its compliance with these and other
applicable City regulations. Following City staff review of the plan and
supporting documents, and following discussions regarding necessary
revisions, the applicant shall resubmit additional copies of the corrected plan to
the Building Official (or designee) within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the
initial City staff review. Upon further review and finding that all revisions have
been made in conformance with aforementioned discussions, the Building
Official, upon consultation with the Planning Director, may approve, approve
subject to certain conditions, or not approve the Site Plan.
(2) City Staff Review of Site Plans for PDs and CUPs: Site Plans for a Planned
Development (PD) or a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) will be processed
according to the procedures prescribed for those applications in Chapter 2,
Division 2 and 3, respectively.
(3) Appeal of City Staff Decision: The applicant or property owner may appeal the
decision of the Planning Director to the Planning and Zoning Commission by
filing a written Notice of Appeal in the office of the Planning Director no later
than ten (10) calendar days after the date upon which the Planning Director
denied the application. The Notice of Appeal shall set forth in clear and
concise fashion the basis for the appeal. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider the appeal at a public meeting no later than thirty
(30) calendar days after the date upon which the Notice of Appeal was filed.
(4) Final Approval in Case of Appeal: The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
determine final approval or disapproval of all Site Plan applications.
(b) Revisions to the Approved Site Plan:
(1) Minor Revisions/Amendments: It is recognized that final architectural and
engineering design may necessitate minor changes in the approved Site Plan.
In such cases, the Director of Planning, or his/her designee, shall have the
authority to approve minor modifications to an approved Site Plan (which shall
be submitted as an amended Site Plan which substantially conforms to the
previously approved Site Plan). Submission materials and requirements for
approval of an amended Site Plan shall be as determined by the Director of
Planning, or his/her designee.
(2) Major Revisions: In the event of revisions that are more extensive in nature
(i.e., do not conform to the description for minor amendments above), a
revised Site Plan must be resubmitted, reviewed, and approved by the
Director of Planning (or his/her designee). Revised Site Plans for Planned
Developments (PDs) and Conditional Use Permits (CUPs) must be resubmitted
and reviewed by the Director of Planning (or his/her designee) and must be
reconsidered by the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the City Council
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 2, Divisions 2 and 3, as
applicable.
(c) Standards for Site Plan Review & Evaluation: The Director of Planning, or his/her
designee, and the Building Official, or his/her designee, shall review the Site Plan for
compliance with all applicable City ordinances with respect to the following:
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-6
(1) The plan's compliance with all provisions of chapters 2, 3, and 4 of this UDC,
and other applicable ordinances.
(2) The relationship of the development to adjacent uses in terms of harmonious
design, façade treatment, setbacks, building materials, maintenance of
property values, and any possible negative impacts.
(3) The provision of a safe and efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation
system (driveways, TIA, etc.).
(4) The design and location of off-street parking and loading facilities to ensure
that all such spaces are usable and are safely and conveniently arranged.
(5) The sufficient width and suitable grade and location of streets designed to
accommodate prospective traffic and to provide access for fire fighting and
emergency equipment to buildings.
(6) The coordination of streets so as to arrange a convenient system consistent
with the Thoroughfare Plan of the City of Pearland, as amended.
(7) The use of landscaping and screening to provide adequate buffers to shield
lights, noise, movement, or activities from adjacent properties when necessary.
(8) Exterior lighting to ensure safe movement and for security purposes, which
shall be arranged so as to minimize glare and reflection upon adjacent
properties.
(9) Protection and conservation of water courses and areas that are subject to
flooding.
(10)The adequacy of water, drainage, sewerage facilities, solid waste disposal, and
other utilities necessary for essential services to residents and occupants.
(d) Effect of Review/Approval: The Site Plan shall be considered authorization to
proceed with application for a building permit for the site.
Secttiion 4..1..1..4 Expiirattiion & Exttensiion
(a) Validity & Lapse of Site Plan Approval:
(1) The approved Site Plan shall be valid for a period of six (6) months from the
date of final approval unless a complete application for a building permit has
been submitted and approved within such period.
(2) Extension & Reinstatement Procedure: Prior to the lapse of approval for a Site
Plan, the applicant may petition the City (in writing) to extend the plan approval.
If no petition for extension of Site Plan approval is submitted, then the plan
shall be deemed to have expired and shall become null and void. Any new
request for Site Plan approval shall be submitted with a new application form,
with a new filing fee, and with new plans and materials in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section.
(b) Determination of Extension. The Planning Director may extend the Site Plan for a
period not to exceed six (6) months, taking into consideration the reasons for the
lapse, the ability of the property owner to comply with any conditions attached to the
original approval, and the extent to which development regulations would apply to
the Site Plan at that point in time.
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-7
(c) Number of Extensions & Time Period. If granted an extension, a Site Plan shall
be permitted one (1) extension only for a period not to exceed six (6) months.
Diiviisiion 2  Consttrructtiion Perrmiitts
Secttiion 4..1..2..1 Generall Proviisiions
(a) Terminology. The terms construction permit or building permit refer to any
authorization to construct, alter or place a structure on a lot, tract or parcel. The
terms exclude an authorization to construct a capital improvement to be dedicated to
the public in support of a proposed land use, the grading of land, the removal of
vegetation, and other activities authorized to prepare a development site for
construction of a structure.
(b) Effect. Approval of a construction permit authorizes the property owner to place or
construct the structure on the lot, tract or parcel in accordance with the terms of the
permit. Approval of a construction permit confirms that the application conforms to all
requirements of this Unified Development Code pertaining to the construction of the
proposed structure.
(c) Rules of Priority Among Construction Permits. The following rules of priority
apply among construction permits.
(1) A floodplain permit shall be approved prior to a building permit.
(2) A building permit shall be approved prior to a certificate of occupancy.
(3) Where a building permit is required, an application for a sign permit may
accompany the application for a building permit, provided that the building
permit application is decided first.
(d) Prior Approvals. An application for a construction permit is the last step in the
development process. All zoning approvals, subdivision plats and site preparation

(a) Subbase for Parking Areas.
(1) Generally: This section governs the placement and compaction of all materials
obtained for utilization in the construction of off-street parking lots.
(2) Construction Methods:
a. The area shall be cleared of stumps, brush, logs, rubbish, trees and
shrubs, except trees and shrubs in certain areas designated for
preservation. Those trees, shrubs and other landscape features
specifically designated by the responsible official for preservation shall be
carefully protected from abuse, marring and damage during construction.
b. Stump holes or other small excavations in the limits of the construction
shall be backfilled with suitable material and thoroughly tamped by
approved methods before commencing embankment construction. The
surface of the ground, including plowed loosened ground or surface
roughened by small washes or otherwise, shall be restored by blading or
other methods, and, where indicated on plans or required by the City
Engineer, the ground surface thus prepared shall be compacted by
sprinkling and rolling.
c. Except as otherwise required by the plans, all parking lots shall be
constructed in layers approximately parallel to the finished grade of the
roadbed, and unless variations are otherwise specified and approved by
the City Engineer, each layer shall be so constructed as to provide a
uniform slope of one-fourth inch per foot.
(3) Embankment:
a. Embankment material shall be consistent with the City of Pearland (COP)
specification section for Bedding, Backfill, and Embankment Material.
b. Except as otherwise specified, embankment filling shall be constructed in
successive layers for the full width of the individual parking lot cross
section and in lengths as are best suited to the sprinkling and compaction
methods utilized.
c. Layers of embankment may be formed by utilizing equipment which will
spread the material as it is dumped, or they may be formed by being
spread by blading or other acceptable methods from piles or windrows
dumped from excavating or hauling equipment in amounts that provide
even distribution.
d. Each layer of embankment fill shall be uniform as to material, density and
moisture content before beginning compaction. Where layers of unlike
materials about each other, each layer shall be feather-edged for at least
100 feet or the material shall be so mixed as to prevent abrupt changes in
the soil. No material placed in the embankment by dumping in a pile or
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-40
windrow shall be incorporated in a layer in that position, but all piles or
windrows shall be moved by blading or similar methods.
e. Compaction of embankments shall be obtained by the method described
as ordinary compaction.
(4) Ordinary Compaction: When the ordinary compaction method is specified, the
following shall apply. Depth means the depth of material achieved upon
compaction until there is no evidence of further compaction, in accordance with
the provisions governing rolling. Prior to and in conjunction with the rolling
operation, each layer shall be compacted to a minimum of 95% maximum dry
density within ±3% of the optimum, unless otherwise specified by the Design
Engineer brought to the moisture content ordered by the Citys Engineering
Department and shall be kept leveled with suitable equipment to ensure
uniform compaction over the entire layer.
(5) All parking lot pavements shall consist of a minimum 6 inch of Class A, Lime
Treated Subgrade compacted to a minimum of 95% maximum dry density
within ±3% of the optimum.

Secttiion 4..2..1..5 Offff--Sttreett Parkiing Lott Consttructtiion  Base Course
(a) Base Course for Parking Areas.
(1) Generally: For off-street parking lot pavements, flexible base shall consist of a
foundation course of composed of crushed stone or other stone materials six
inches in depth for the surface course or other base courses, and shall be
constructed as specified in this section in one or more courses in conformity
with the typical sections shown on plans or grades established by the Design
Engineer. Concrete parking lots do not require base course.
(2) Material: One of the following materials; crushed stone, recycled crushed
concrete base, cement-stabilized crushed stone, cement-stabilized bank-run
gravel, recycled crushed stone and hot mixed asphalt base, can be used as
specified in the COP specification section for Base Course for Pavement. The
material shall be a graded material that has sufficient fine material to bind the
base. The material sources shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer.
(3) Construction Methods:
a. Immediately before placing the base material, the subgrade shall be
checked as to conformity with dry density, moisture content, grade and
section.
b. Materials deposited upon the subgrade shall be spread and shaped the
same day unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer in writing. If
inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances render impractical
the spreading of the material during the first 24-hour period, the material
shall be scarified and spread in a manner subject to approval by the City
Engineer. The material will be sprinkled, if directed, and will then be
bladed, dragged and shaped to conform to typical sections as shown on
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-41
the plans. All areas and nests of segregated coarse or fine material shall
be corrected or removed and replaced with well-graded material, as
directed by the City Engineer. If additional binder is considered desirable
or necessary after the material is spread and shaped, it shall be furnished
and applied in an amount subject to approval by the City Engineer. The
binder material shall be spread by harrowing, brooming or other approved
methods.
c. The base course shall be compacted in accordance to COP specification
section for Base Course for Pavement with a minimum of 95% dry density
with moisture content within ±3% of the optimum, unless otherwise
specified by the Design Engineer.

Diiviisiion 2  Landscapiing
Secttiion 4..2..2..1 Purpose
(a) Orderly, Safe and Healthful Development. For the purpose of providing for the
orderly, safe and healthful development of land located within the City limits and
promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the community, it is necessary to
establish requirements for the installation and maintenance of landscaping elements
and other site improvements in off-street parking areas and other developed
properties.
(b) Mitigation of Adverse Effects. Paved surfaces, automobiles, buildings and other
improvements all produce great increases in air temperatures, a problem especially
noticeable in this coastal region, whereas plants have the opposite effect through
transpiration and the creation of shade. Likewise, impervious surfaces created by
development generate greater water runoff causing problems from erosion and
flooding.
(c) Natural Environment and Ecological Balance. Preserving and improving the
natural environment and maintaining a working ecological balance are significant
concerns to the community. The fact that landscape elements can contribute to the
processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration, water absorption, and noise, glare
and heat abatement as well as the preservation of the community's aesthetic
qualities indicates that the use of landscape elements benefits the health, welfare
and general well being of the community and, therefore, it is proper that the use of
the landscape elements be required.
(d) Oxygen, Heat, Glare, Water Runoff. Landscape installation is required within offstreet
paved surface areas to regenerate oxygen and to reduce heat, glare, water
runoff and other conditions connected with the construction of structures or paved
areas within the parcel.
Secttiion 4..2..2..2 Enfforcementt
(a) Responsible Official and Responsibilities. The Planning Director shall be the
responsible official for this division. The Director is charged with administering this
division and securing compliance with this division. In furtherance of this
responsibility, the Director shall:
(1) Make inspections as needed to effectuate the purposes and intent of this
division, and initiate appropriate action to bring about compliance with this
division if the inspections disclose any instance of noncompliance.
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-44
(2) Investigate any complaints of alleged violations of this division, and maintain a
record in the planning department office of the disposition of the complaints.

(5) Refuse to issue an occupancy certificate where the requirements of this
division have not been met. A temporary occupancy certificate may be issued
where provisions have been made for landscaping installation at the most
advantageous time for planting, not to exceed 6 months from the date of
issuance.
(6) Request the assistance of the City Attorney in taking appropriate legal action
upon the failure of the responsible party to comply with the notice of violation at
the time specified therein.
(b) Authorization. The Director is authorized and directed to lawfully enter all premises
at reasonable times to perform inspections to determine compliance with the
provisions of this division.
(c) Action after Determination of Violation. When the Director determines that a
violation of this division exists, the responsible official shall take action as follows:
(1) Give written notice of the violation to the management, agent or owner shown
on the most recent tax roll of the City.
(2) The notice shall include:
a. A description of the location of the property involved, either by address or
by legal description;

f. The name of the person to whom the notice of violation is directed;
g. A statement that failure to comply with the requirements of the notice will
result in the City taking enforcement procedures in order to secure
compliance; and
h. A description of the procedures available for review of the action of the
Director as set out in this division.
(d) Notice.
(1) Notices of violation shall be personally delivered, or sent by certified mail,
return receipt requested, and (if possible) by posting a copy of the notice in a
conspicuous place on the premises.
(2) The Director shall maintain a record of the manner of service of the notice.
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-45
(3) If the order is not complied with within the time specified in the order, the
Director shall use all available means of enforcement in order to secure
compliance.
(4) When any notice has been issued and the notice becomes an order within the
terms of this division, the responsible official shall cause to be placed in a
conspicuous place on the premises a notice which shall read substantially as
follows:

building development that would conflict with this division, this division shall
supersede and prevail over the other requirements.
(3) If a principal use and some or all of the parking area, required or otherwise,
serving the principal use are located on separate parcels, the landscape
installation required in this division shall prevail as to all the property with the
result that an equivalent percentage of the area of all parcels utilized by a
principal use shall be landscaped in compliance with this division.
(4) If more landscaping is required in any zoning district, overlay zoning district, or
PD district, the greater standards shall apply.
(b) Existing Development Areas; Nonconformance.
(1) All property with existing development on the effective date of the ordinance
from which this division derives which is not in compliance with this division
shall be considered nonconforming and allowed to continue until the time a
building permit is granted to reconstruct or enlarge an existing structure on the
property to an extent exceeding five hundred (500) square feet of the exterior
dimensions of the structure. At that time, this division shall apply to the
previous existing parcel areas as well as any new paved areas, and the areas
shall be brought into compliance. A plan showing existing and new
development and the proposed landscaping shall be submitted in accordance
with this division. In order to encourage early landscaping in existing paved
areas and the preservation of trees that are already established and growing in
these areas an additional credit shall be given in accordance with Division 3 of

shall be kept free of refuse and debris. All planted areas shall be provided with a
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-51
readily available water supply and watered sufficiently to ensure continuous healthy
growth and development. Maintenance shall include the replacement of all dead
plant material needed to meet the requirements of this division. Should a tree die or
be removed for which credit has been obtained pursuant to this Unified Development
Code, trees sufficient to equal the area credited shall be required. A smaller tree that
will have a mature crown similar to the tree removed may be substituted if the
planting area or pervious cover provided for the larger tree is retained; such
substitution shall require the approval of the Planning Director.
(c) Planting Criteria.
(1) Trees: Trees planted for credit under Subsection (c) of this section shall be a
minimum of two inches in caliper, measured twelve inches above ground level,
and six feet in height when measured immediately after planting. Trees shall
have an average mature crown greater than 15 feet. Trees having an average
mature crown less than 15 feet may be substituted by grouping the trees so as
to create at maturity the equivalent of a 15-foot crown if the drip line area is
maintained.
(2) Shrubs, Vines and Ground Cover: Shrubs, vines and ground cover planted
pursuant to this division should be good, healthy nursery stock. Shrubs must
be, at a minimum, a one-gallon container size at the time of planting. Only

systems, and similar areas as approved by the Parks Director, where
functional need for turf is demonstrated, are exempt from the turf area
limitation and micro irrigation requirements.
1. Irrigation Zone Design
A site plan, at a readable and defined scale, shall be submitted
illustrating the proposed irrigation zones, delineating micro-irrigation
zones and areas utilizing irrigation techniques other than microirrigation.
Fifty (50) percent of the on-site green space shall be
allowed to utilize irrigation techniques other than micro-irrigation. Turf
areas shall be on separate irrigation zones from other landscaping
plant zones. The irrigation system should be prepared by a licensed
irrigator and designed to accommodate separate landscape plant
zones based on differing water requirements.
2. Spacing
Sprinkler spacing shall not exceed 55 percent of the sprinklers
diameter of coverage.
3. Separate Sprays and Rotors
Sprays and rotors shall not be combined on the same control valve
circuit.
4. Matched Precipitation Rates
Sprays and rotors shall have matching application rates within each
irrigation zone.
5. Overspray/Runoff
All irrigation systems shall be designed to avoid overspray/runoff, low
head drainage, or other similar conditions where water flows onto or
over adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, roadways, walkways,
structures, or water features. Narrow areas (four feet wide or less)
shall not be irrigated unless micro-irrigation is utilized.
6. Control Equipment
Irrigation control equipment shall include an automatic irrigation
controller with the following features: program flexibility such as repeat
cycles and multiple program capabilities; battery back-up to retain the
irrigation programs; and a rain sensor device.
7. Landscape
Using the concept of a Xeriscape landscape, a site plan shall be
submitted identifying all existing vegetation to be preserved, proposed
turf, and other landscape areas. Installed trees and plants should be
grouped together into landscape plant zones according to water and
cultural (soil, climate and light) requirements. Plant groupings based
on water requirements are as follows: natural, drought tolerant, and
oasis.
8. Turf/Turfgrass
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-53
A maximum of fifty (50) percent of green space may be planted with
turfgrass configured with a permanent irrigation system. Turfgrass
planted in excess of this limitation shall not have a permanent
irrigation system. Micro-irrigation shall not be used on turfgrass.
9. Mulch
A layer of mulch with a minimum depth of three (3) inches shall be
specified on the site plan in plant beds and around individual trees in
turf areas. Organic mulches are preferred. The mulch should not be
placed directly against the plant stem or tree trunk. Mulch shall not be
required in annual beds.
10. Maintenance and Management
The landscape and irrigation system shall be maintained and
managed to ensure water efficiency, and prevent wasteful practices.
This should include, but not be limited to: resetting the automatic
controller according to the season; flushing the filters; testing the rain
sensor device; monitoring, adjusting, and repairing irrigation
equipment such that the efficiency of the system is maintained;
replenishing mulch; and utilizing turf and landscape best management
practices.
(d) Construction Phase.
(1) No more than 25% of the drip line zone of trees to be preserved shall be paved
with concrete, asphalt, or other impervious material. There shall be no
trenching around the border of and no fill shall be placed within the drip line
zone of a tree to be preserved.
(2) Soil and other materials shall not be temporarily or permanently stored in
locations which would cause suffocation of root systems of trees to be
preserved.
(3) The permanent vegetation shall be installed on the construction site as soon as
utilities are in place and final grades are achieved. Final grading and removal of
vegetation shall not occur more than 30 days prior to schedule paving.
(e) Removal of Diseased or Dangerous Trees and Vegetation.
(1) Upon direction from the Planning Director, a property owner may be required to
treat or remove trees suffering from transmittable diseases or pests or allow the
City to do so, charging the actual cost thereof to the property owner.
(2) The Planning Director may require the removal of a tree or part of a tree or any
other vegetation that is within or overhanging a public right-of-way or easement
if the tree or vegetation:
a. Is diseased or infested and in danger of falling;
b. Is creating a traffic hazard or sight distance hazard for traffic on a public
street; or
c. Is interfering with safe and proper maintenance of the right-of-way or
easement.
(f) Landscape Reserve Required. At a minimum, a landscape reserve of at least ten
feet (10), across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the
exterior of the residential lots abutting such a thoroughfare, collector, or
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-54
nonresidential use or zoning district. The reserve shall be outside any wall or fence
separating the lots from the thoroughfare, collector, or nonresidential use or
nonresidential zoning district. In this case, outside shall mean on the side of the
wall or fence that is closest to the thoroughfare, collector, or nonresidential use or
nonresidential zoning district.

Secttiion 4..2..3..1 IInttentt
(a) The intent of this division is to encourage site planning which furthers the
preservation of trees and natural areas by these methods; to protect trees during
construction; to facilitate site design and construction which contributes to the long
term viability of existing trees; and to control the unnecessary removal of trees;
require on-site replacement of trees that must be removed and require off-site
replacement of trees that cannot be replaced on-site, either by direct planting or
through a "Tree Trust." It is the further intent of this division to achieve the following
broader objectives:
(1) Protect healthy trees and preserve the natural, ecological, environmental, and
aesthetic qualities of the City.
(2) Protect and increase the value of residential and commercial properties within
the City.
(3) Prohibit the indiscriminate clear-cutting of property.
(4) Maintain and enhance a positive image for the attraction of new business
enterprises to the City.
Secttiion 4..2..3..2 Deffiiniittiions
(a) For the purpose of this division, certain words or terms applicable hereto are defined
as hereinafter provided. Words and terms used in this division, but not defined in this
division shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Chapter 5 of this UDC, or other
ordinances in the City. Words and terms defined in two ordinances shall be read in
harmony unless there exists an irreconcilable conflict, in which case the definition
contained in this division shall control.
(1) Circumference: The distance around the perimeter of the tree trunk as
measured four and one-half feet (4.5') above the ground using an ordinary
measuring tape. For multiple-trunk trees, the trunk circumference is deemed to
be equal to the circumference of the largest trunk plus half the circumference of
each additional trunk. Measurements should be accurate to the nearest onehalf
inch (½"). (For conversion to diameter, the circumference can be divided
by 3.142.)
(2) Criteria Manual: The manual to be used and interpreted by City personnel in
accordance with this division for the City's urban forest preservation and
enhancement. (The manual is available at the City Park and Recreation
Department and was originally adopted as Attachment A to City Ordinance No.
772, which was the Tree Protection and Preservation Ordinance. The manual
is adopted as part of this UDC by reference.)
(3) Critical Root Zone: For any given tree, the area within a circle centered on the
trunk location that contains the majority of tree roots essential for tree growth
and survival. The circles diameter is one-half the sum of the broadest and the
narrowest of the drip line diameters.
(4) Damage or Damaged: To "damage" a tree means to take any action which
could result in a tree's death, either immediately or after a period of two (2)
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-61
years. Some examples of such action, which are not intended to limit this
definition, are as follows: severing the main trunk or large branches or roots;
girdling; poisoning; carving; mutilating; touching with live wires; piercing with
nails or spikes; crushing or exposing the roots; digging or drilling any hole
larger than three (3) cubic feet (a trench) within the Critical Root Zone; or
covering or compacting twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Critical Root
Zone.
(5) DBH (Diameter Breast Height): The distance of the width of the trunk of a tree
as measured four and one-half feet (4.5') above the ground.
(6) Located: A tree is "located" within an area if any part of its trunk is within the
area at ground level. For example, a tree positioned on the property line is
considered to be located in an area or on a subject site when a portion of the
trunk or root flare that is visible above ground is within the area or subject site.
(7) Official: The City Manager or his/her designee.
(8) Temporary Fencing: A six foot (6) high temporary fence shall be installed prior
to any site activity. The temporary fencing shall be placed to protect as much
of the Critical Root Zone as possible for each tree to effectively protect and
prevent persons, machinery, trash, material, and other items from occupying
the Critical Root Zones of a tree or group of Protected Trees. The temporary
fence may incorporate existing fences or walls as well as temporary fencing. A
separate fence permit is not required for construction of a fence under this
section, if a building permit for the work is in effect and a Tree Disposition Plan
has been approved.
(9) Tree: A woody plant having one well-defined stem or trunk, a defined crown
and a mature height of at least eight (8) feet. Trees protected and/or regulated
by this division of the UDC are listed in the Citys Tree List, a copy of which is

Tree List (available in the City Parks and Recreation Department) and
that is located within the City;
(b) LARGE TREE: Any tree with a diameter (DBH) of twelve inches (12") or
more. In case a tree is removed, it is presumed to have been a Large
Tree if the diameter of the stump is twelve inches (12") or greater,
measured in any direction.
(c) HERITAGE TREE: Any Protected Tree with a diameter (DBH) of twentyfour
inches (24) or more located anywhere within the City. In case a tree
is removed, it is presumed to have been a Heritage Tree if the diameter of
the stump is twenty-four inches (24") or greater, measured in any
direction.
(d) REPLACEMENT TREE/QUALIFIED TREE: Any tree included in the
Protected Tree List (available in the City Parks and Recreation
Department), with a DBH of at least two inches (2).
(10) Tree Disposition Plan: Must specify how Protected Trees and Critical Root
Zones will be protected from development and pre-development activity. The
Tree Disposition Plan shall specify trees to be relocated, removed or replaced.
The tree survey and disposition plan shall be submitted with the application for
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-62
any development permit and must be approved before said permit may be
issued.
(11) Tree Survey: An on-the-ground survey containing the location of Protected
Trees, their diameters, types (species), and crown area (critical root zones).
The Tree Survey must depict for any given Subject Site: (a) every Protected
Tree located on the Subject Site, and (b) identify every Protected Tree located
elsewhere which has thirty percent (30%) or more of its Critical Root Zone in
such Subject Site. The tree survey and disposition plan shall be submitted with
the application for any development permit and must be approved before said
permit may be issued.
(12) Urban Forester: A resource professional, charged with the responsibility of
planning, establishing, protecting, and managing trees and associated plants,

Secttiion 4..2..3..8 Tree Prottecttiion
(a) A major purpose of this division is to protect all trees which are not removed and to
allow approved construction to occur. The following procedures shall apply to all
types of construction projects which involve development around trees.
(b) The following procedures are deemed appropriate in the situations noted; however,
unique circumstances may allow modifications if deemed necessary by the City
Manager or his/her designee.
(1) Prohibited Activities: The following activities shall be prohibited within the
Critical Root Zone of any Protected Tree which is subject to the requirements
of this division.
a. Material Storage - No materials intended for use in construction or waste
materials accumulated due to excavation or demolition shall be placed
within the Critical Root Zone of any tree.
b. Equipment Cleaning/Liquid Disposal - No equipment may be cleaned or
other liquids deposited within the Critical Root Zone of any tree. This
would include but not limited to, paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete,
mortar or other materials.
c. Tree Attachments - No signs, wires or other attachments, other than
those of a protective nature shall be attached to any tree.
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-69
d. Vehicular Traffic - No vehicle, construction equipment or parking is
allowed within the Critical Root Zone of any tree.
e. Trespassing - Trespass into protective fencing is prohibited.
(2) Pre-Construction Activities: The following procedures shall be followed prior to
construction.
a. Tree Flagging - All Protected Trees to be removed from the construction
site shall be flagged with bright red vinyl tape wrapped around the main
trunk and painted with an orange X at a height of four feet (4') or more.
Tape and paint must be visible to workers on foot or operating heavy
equipment.
b. Protective Fencing - Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Tree
Disposition Conditions, each Protected Tree to be preserved must be
fenced during Development or Pre-Development Activity.
1. Fencing Criteria - The Tree Disposition Plan shall specify protective
fencing of the Critical Root Zone whenever reasonably practicable,
unless a different area is prescribed in accordance with the Criteria
Manual. Unless the Tree Disposition Conditions specify otherwise:
- A six-foot or higher fence must surround each protected tree or
group of protected trees, effectively preventing persons,
machinery, trash, material and other items from occupying the
area within the protective fencing;
- The fence must be constructed of durable, high visibility
materials supported on poles or fence posts set firmly in the
ground;
- The fence must be able to resist intrusions and impacts likely to
be encountered on a construction site;
- The fence may incorporate existing fences or walls as well as
temporary fencing; and
- Each fence must display a prominent bilingual warning sign as
set forth in the Criteria Manual.
2. Fence Permit - A separate fence permit is not required for
construction of a fence under this section, if a building permit for the
work is in effect and a Tree Disposition Plan has been approved.
3. Trash, Storage Prohibited - It shall be unlawful for any person to use
the area within the protective fencing, required by this section, for
trash disposal, storage, vehicle parking or any other use that could
adversely affect tree roots.
c. Trunk Protection - In situations where a Protected Tree remains within six
feet (6) of intended construction, the tree shall be protected by enclosing
the entire circumference of the tree's trunk with lumber encircled with wire
or other means that does not damage the tree.
d. Construction Pruning - In cases where a tree has a low canopy or limbs
may be broken during the course of construction, the obtrusive limb(s)
may be cut. Trees must be pruned according to the specifications set
forth by ANSI A300.
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-70
e. Mulch - In Critical Root Zone areas where vehicles or equipment must
pass, the addition of six inches (6") of shredded mulch or wood chips
covered by a sheet of three-quarter-inch plywood is necessary to reduce
the risk of severe soil compaction. The mulch and plywood shall be
spread on-site or removed following the completion of the project.
f. Watering - Trees which are being protected should receive supplemental
water during times of drought or low rainfall. As a rule of thumb a weekly
application of approximately fifty (50) gallons of water per one-inch
diameter applied slowly to the root zone will be sufficient.
(3) Improvement Within the Critical Root Zone of a Protected Tree: Design
constraints dictate that trees slated for preservation have some encroachment on
their Critical Root Zone. The following is the minimum design criteria which is
allowed within the Critical Root Zone of a Protected Tree. Development
exceeding the criteria would put the tree at risk and therefore it could no longer
be considered a Protected Tree. In such a case, Replacement Trees shall be
required.
a. Grade Changes - In the event that grade changes must be made around
a Protected Tree or group of trees, the following shall be implemented in
order to maintain oxygen and water exchange within the tree's Critical
Root Zone.
1. A minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the Critical Root Zone
shall be preserved at natural grade with natural ground cover or
landscaping for the tree to be considered a Protected Tree.
2. No cut or fill greater than two (2) inches shall be located closer to
the tree trunk than one-half of the radius of the Critical Root Zone
radius distance.
3. Increase grade: Soil grade within the Critical Root Zone of trees
should not be increased more than two (2) to three (3) inches using
clean bank sand. Any increase above this can be detrimental to the
tree. Any attempts to protect trees from the detrimental effects of
increased grade must be approved by the City Manager or his/her
designee.
b. Boring of Utilities  Boring may be permitted under Protected Trees in
certain circumstances. The minimum length of the bore shall be the width
of the tree's Critical Root Zone and shall be a minimum depth of fortyeight
(48) inches.
c. Trenching - Irrigation systems shall be designed to avoid trenching across
the Critical Root Zone of any large tree.
d. Paving - A maximum of twenty-five (25) percent of the Critical Root Zone
of a Protected Tree may be covered with impervious material. The
pavement and the cut and fill for the pavement shall not exceed one-half
of the Critical Root Zone radius distance.

(a) Off-Site Planting of Replacement Trees. Replacement Trees should be planted on
the site or easement from which the existing trees are to be removed. Subject to the
approval of the City Manager or his designee, an applicant may initiate a proposal to
plant trees off-site.
(b) Easements and Rights-of-Way.
(1) The location of replacement trees shall not be an area such that the mature
canopy or roots of the tree will interfere with any public utility.
(2) All replacement trees shall be planted no less than ten feet (10) from fire
hydrants.
(3) Any replacement tree planted in a median must be located no less than six and
one-half (6.5) feet from the curb.

than one hundred (100) feet from an intersection and no less than fifty (50)
feet from a mid-block opening.
(c) Plantings After Project Completion. Replacement trees shall be planted prior to
the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or project release. Optimum planting
times do not always correspond with project completion. For that reason,
replacement tree plantings may take place after the project is released by the City;
provided, that before the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, a fiscal security is
posted in the amount equal to the prevailing rate for replacement trees with a one (1)
year guarantee, plus fifteen (15) percent to cover administrative cost.

shade trees with a minimum two-inch (2) caliper measured at twelve
inches (12") above the root ball shall be provided, with the total caliper
inches equal to at least one inch (1") for each ten feet (10') of lot depth.
This buffer shall be at least thirty (30) feet wide if screening is achieved
above by a vegetative screen and not an opaque screening wall. The 30
buffer described shall include landscaping to provide a semi-opaque
screen utilizing the following:
i. Large shade trees with a minimum two-inch (2) caliper measured at
twelve inches (12") above the root ball shall be provided, with the total

c. In situations where a fence already exists along the property line between
the non-residential or multiple-family use and the residential use, the
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-75
screening required by this section shall be achieved by the vegetative
screen and 30 buffer described above, unless the nonresidential or
multiple-family use obtains permission from the owner(s) of the existing
fence to replace said fence with the opaque screening wall and 25 buffer
described above.
d. Prior to construction of buffers, complete plans showing type of material,
depth of beam and structural support shall be submitted to the Building
Inspection Division for analysis to determine whether or not:
1. The screen will withstand the pressures of time and nature; and
2. The screen adequately accomplishes the purpose for which it was
intended.
e. The Planning Director shall determine if the buffer meets the
requirements of this section.
(b)Parking Area Screening Along Major and Secondary Thoroughfares.
Landscaping shall be required for the screening of parking areas along major
thoroughfares or secondary thoroughfares when nonresidential parking areas are
located on the nonresidential lot such that they are adjacent to such roadways (i.e.,
there is no building between the parking area and the lot line adjacent to the
roadway). In such case, parking areas shall be screened by a continuous hedge of
shrubs that are maintained at a height of no more than thirty-six inches (36) nor less

secondary thoroughfare are platted so that the rear or side yards of singlefamily
or two-family residential lots therein are within 200 of a right-of-way line
of said major or secondary thoroughfare as described in Chapter 3, or are
separated from such thoroughfare by an alley, landscape, or open space
area/detention facility and utility easements, or back up to such thoroughfare,
the developer shall provide, at its sole expense, a minimum six-foot tall
masonry screening wall (also see Subsection (2) below), or some other
alternative form of screening, if approved by the Planning Director, according to
the following alternatives and standards. All screening shall be adjacent to the
right-of-way or property line and fully located on the private lot(s), including
columns and decorative features. All forms of screening shall conform to the
requirements of City ordinances and policies that govern sight distance for
traffic safety.
(2) Screening Alternatives: Screening shall be provided in accordance with, and
shall be constructed to, standards and criteria as set forth in the Citys EDCM.

by Planning Director and the City Engineer with the Preliminary Subdivision
Plat or Preliminary Development Plat application. Alternatives that may
considered include:
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-76
a. A living/landscaped screen in conjunction with decorative metal (e.g.,
wrought iron) fence sections with masonry columns;
b. A combination of berms and living/landscaped screening;
c. A combination of berms, decorative masonry walls and living/landscaped
screening, either with or without a decorative metal or Wood Crete type
of fence with masonry columns; or
d. Some other creative screening alternative may be approved if it meets the
spirit and intent of this Section, if it is demonstrated to be long-lasting and
generally maintenance-free, and if the Planning Director and City
Engineer find it to be in the public interest to approve the alternative
screening device.
(3) Time Required for Opacity: Any required screening device shall be, or shall
achieve, at least six feet in height and at least ninety percent opacity within
three years of initial installation/planting. Any landscaping used to achieve the

feet in width shall be dedicated to the City or to a property owners association
on the private lot side and adjacent to the entire length of the screening wall or
device.
(5) Installation: The screening/wall/device shall be installed prior to final
acceptance of the subdivision public improvements. All landscape materials, if
utilized, shall be installed in accordance with Division 2 and/or Division 3 of this
article. Failure to properly install all components of a required screening wall or
device within the prescribed time frame, shall constitute a violation of this
Unified Development Code, and shall authorize the City Engineer to refuse
acceptance of the subdivision public improvements.
(6) Design of Walls: All masonry, wrought iron, steel or aluminum screening wall
plans and details must be designed and sealed by a licensed professional
engineer, and must be approved by the City Engineer. Use of chain-link,
chicken-wire, hog-wire fencing, and any other material similar in appearance
and quality is expressly prohibited. The use of wood is prohibited.
(7) Height of Screening: The height of required screening devices, including spans
between columns, shall be a minimum of six feet and shall be no more than
eight feet. Decorative columns, pilasters, stone caps, sculptural elements, and

Secttiion 4..2..4..2 Screeniing ffor Uttiilliitty Supportt Sttructtures and Sttattiions
(a) Applicability. This section shall apply to all utility support structures or stations
located on private property regardless if there is an easement or other form of
agreement between the utility company or property owner.
(b) Support Structures and Stations Defined. These shall include, but not be limited
to, any switching equipment, lift stations, pipe valves connected to pipes above
ground, boxes or cabinets, cabling equipment or wiring above ground, transmitting
equipment, control rooms, control cabinets, etc. Utility poles and transformers and
like appurtenances attached to utility poles more than ten feet (10) above the ground
are not considered a support structure or station.
(c) Regulations. A utility support structure or station located on private property or
outside a public street right of way must have proper screening. The construction or
modification of an existing utility support structure or station equal to more than fifty
percent (50%) of its value or area, must provide screening meeting one of the
following:
(1) Eight foot (8) high masonry fence with up to a maximum of four-foot (4') long
sections of wrought iron or similar style fencing material to allow for security.
For walls or sides that have over fifty percent (50%) masonry as a component
(not counting the gate) no landscaping would be required on that side. The
gate may or may not be sight bearing, but would need to be wrought iron or
metal in a neutral or natural color - not gray or steel. All drives and work areas
will be paved with concrete within the area under the utilities control.
(2) Wrought iron fencing or substantially similar style, eight feet (8) high, with gate
similar in style to the fencing shall be permitted, but shall require a concrete
slab over the entire area under the utilities control including the drive or access
to the support structure or station.
(3) Opaque or nearopaque live vegetative screening year-round from the ground
to a height of at least eight feet (8) at installation along the boundary lines of
the easement or area containing the utility facilities or apparatus. The
screening shall provide a minimum of fifty percent (50%) screening during the
growing season. The planting shall be a minimum of eight feet in height at a
spacing of at least four feet (4) on center.
(4) A self-contained masonry building that houses the equipment, provided the
structure is constructed consistent with the appearance of surrounding
businesses or homes in the area in which it is located. Factors affecting
appearance shall include, but not be limited to, pitched shingle roofs, façade
articulations, color scheme, and architecture trim.
(d) Alternative. If the utility company does not wish to install the screening as outlined, it
may, in its application for a conditional use permit, submit an alternative plan for
providing proper screening. If the alternate screening plan is approved with the
CUP, the utility company may install screening pursuant thereto in lieu of screening
that conforms with the requirements of this section.
(e) Exceptions. The following two conditions exempt certain equipment from the above
requirements and the requirement to obtain a Conditional Use Permit (CUP):
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-79
(1) Where no more than two support structures and/or stations as defined above
are within fifty feet (50) of each other, are located within a common public
utility easement, and each structure or station is located on a concrete pad with
the dimensions of the structure being no larger than six feet (6) in height, four
feet (4) deep, and seven feet (7) wide and is located at least fifty feet (50)
from the ROW line of a public street.
(2) Pedestals, cabinets, or similar equipment structures when the structure is less
than three feet (3) in height, covers less than six (6) square feet, and is located
in a common public utility easement, but is partially hidden from public view
from a public street by landscaping, building, or fencing, as deemed
appropriate by the Director of Planning or designee.

(1) Materials Permitted - Fences may be constructed of wood, decorative metal,
chain link or woven wire mesh, and other materials traditionally used in private
fence construction. New and innovative materials such as plastics, PVCs,
metal panel or metal slat, honeycomb, cementatious fiber board (e.g., Wood
Crete), and other similar materials may be approved for use by the Citys
Building Official if the material is proven to be sturdy, durable and relatively
maintenance-free.
(2) Fences Permitted in Front Yard(s) Adjacent to a Public Street 
a. Except as provided by Subsection b (Decorative Fences) below, no
fence or wall shall be permitted within the required front yard of any
single-family or duplex residential lot which is adjacent to a public
street. No residential fence shall be closer than 15 feet to a public
street; however, in cases where the side or rear building line of the
yards on continuous corner lots adjoin (i.e., the side yard lot is not a
key corner lot), the fence may be constructed out to the property line
of the side yard, such that the street side yard may be included as
part of the lots rear yard area. (See Figure 4-5.)
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-80
b. Decorative Fences - Decorative fences with openings not less than
50% of the fence area and not exceeding four (4) feet in height are
permitted in front yards. Chain link, woven wire mesh metal panel, or
similar materials are not considered decorative fencing, and are
therefore not allowed in front yards.
(3) Perimeter Fencing: Above-ground electrical fencing (does not include
underground virtual fencing, which is allowed), wire mesh (such as hog wire,
chicken wire) and barbed wire are prohibited as perimeter fencing except on
parcels or lots of two acres or greater in size in the Suburban Development
(SD) zoning district and Residential Estate (RE) zoning district.
(4) Fences within Public Easements: Fences within a public easement shall have
a gate or removable panel to allow for maintenance access to such easement.
(5) Fences within Drainage Easements: Fences within a drainage easement
should be constructed in a manner to not restrict the flow of drainage water.
(6) Fences in Side/Rear Yards: Fences located in side or rear yards shall not
exceed eight (8) feet in height.
(7) Fences in COD: For fences located within the Corridor Overlay District (COD),
please refer to section 2.4.5.1 (i).
(8) A permit must be obtained to repair, rebuild, or construct any type of fence
where the market value of the work (materials and labor) exceeds three
hundred (300) dollars.
Chapter 4: Site Development
Page 4-81
(b) Fences in Non-Residential Areas/Districts.
(1) Barbed Wire Fencing: Permanent barbed wire or similar fences shall be
prohibited in districts where used for purposes other than for the control of
livestock. Barbed wire shall be permitted as an accessory material to another
type of fence in industrial zoning districts (M-1 and M-2), and for City facilities
upon approval by City Council, when the barbed wire material is located along
the top of a fence, beginning at a height of at least six feet (6) from ground
level.
(2) Gates for Vehicular Access: Gates designed for vehicular access shall be set
back from the property line a minimum of twenty-four feet (24).
(3) Permit Required: All new, reconstructed, or replaced fences require permits.
(4) Fences within Public Easements: Fences within a public easement shall have
a gate or removable panel to allow for maintenance access to such easement.
(5) Fences within Drainage Easements: Fences within a drainage easement
should be constructed in a manner to not restrict the flow of drainage water.
(6) Height and Material of Fencing: In all yards, fences shall not exceed eight (8)
feet in height. Fences in the front yard, except for properties in the M1 or M2
districts, shall be decorative with openings not less than 50% of the fence area.
