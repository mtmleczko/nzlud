    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Castle Hills, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1995 Code, as supplemented through September 13, 2011, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1995 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Howard George and Lisa Stevens, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Bruce A. Smiley-Kaliff, Mayor; Michael T. Steele, City Manager; Rita Hoyl, Assistant City Manager; Michael Brenan, City Attorney; and Linda Gill, City Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

( Ord. No. 2017-03-14, 3-14-2017 ) 
Sec. 8-51. - Factors to be considered by committee. 
    In reviewing applications and accompanying plans and specifications, the architectural review committee shall consider, at a minimum, the following factors: 
(1)  Appropriate signage; structural aspects, size limitations, color, and other aesthetic considerations. All permanent signs must be approved by the architectural review committee. 
(2)  Conservation of trees and other natural habitat considerations. 
(3)  Harmony of design, colors, materials, and finishes.

(10)  The traffic impact analysis submitted by the applicant as required by subsection 8-48 (d)(11). The architectural review committee shall carefully consider any adverse impacts caused by the development to the adjacent roadway network and furthermore shall consider any adverse impacts to neighbors. The final analysis by the architectural review committee shall not only include the technical analysis submitted, but shall also include common sense and reasoned judgment. For example, the city has received requests to locate large institutional facilities patronized by large numbers of persons on tiny rural roadways only two lanes in width. Streets such as S. Winston Lane, W. Castle Lane and Fox Hall Lane do not have the traffic capacity to accommodate large institutional facilities patronized by large numbers of persons without compromising the safety of users of the streets and the neighbors. 
( Ord. No. 2017-03-14, 3-14-2017 ; Ord. No. 2017-05-01, 5-1-2017 ) 
Sec. 8-52. - Preliminary consultation between applicant and city representative. 
    The applicant shall meet with the City of Castle Hills (City) staff and/or designated representative to determine the scope of the TIA prior to submittal of the TIA. The following sections 8-53 through section 8-58 are guidelines and general requirements to complete a TIA. 
( Ord. No. 2017-05-01, 5-1-2017 ) 
Sec. 8-53. - Definition of impact areas. 
    The area of impact includes the intersections or access points that may be affected by vehicular trips generated by the development. Table 1 shows the anticipated boundary of a TIA as determined by the number of trips generated by the development. Using engineering judgment, the city reserves the right to adjust the boundary area based on characteristics of the development and the surrounding roadway network and therefore may include intersections outside the boundary areas identified in Table 1. All TIAs should, at a minimum, extend to the first signalized intersection. 
TABLE 1. 
Trip Generation (PHT) Analysis Area Type of Intersections to Be Included 100 to < 250 1/4 mile Signalized intersections 250 to &lt 500 1/2 mile Signalized and major* 
unsignalized intersections 500 to < 1,000 1 mile Signalized and major* 
unsignalized intersections 1,000 + 1 to 2 miles Signalized and major* 
unsignalized intersections  
  
*Major unsignalized intersections typically occur when a local roadway, with connectivity to multiple other local roadways serving a larger area, intersect a collector or arterial roadway. 
( Ord. No. 2017-05-01, 5-1-2017 ) 
Sec. 8-54. - Trip generation. 
    The number of site specific trips generated by the proposed development shall be determined using the methodologies within the latest version of the ITE "Trip Generation Manual" and the ITE "Trip Generation Handbook". In some cases, the ITE Trip Generation Manual and ITE Trip Generation Handbook may not apply and should be used with caution, as the development's size may be out of the range of the data points used to calculate the trip generation rates, or there is a small sample size. In these cases, the applicant must contact the city to determine how the trip generation should be developed. In most cases, local data for a similar land use may be utilized. 
( Ord. No. 2017-05-01, 5-1-2017 ) 
Sec. 8-55. - Content and methodology. 
(a)  This section identifies the typical content and methodology to be included within a TIA; however it is not a comprehensive list and additional tasks or analysis may be required as determined during the scoping meeting or subsequent discussion/analysis. 
(b)  A TIA shall include the following: description of the existing conditions, site location, description of the proposed conditions, traffic data collection information, trip generation information, capacity analysis and results, mitigation measures, cost estimates for the mitigation measures, the methodology and assumptions, and a conclusion summarizing the findings and recommendations within the TIA. The report shall also include, at a minimum, the following exhibits: site location, detailed site plan showing the proposed driveway(s) and operations, traffic volumes for each analysis condition, and the trip assignment and distribution of site generated traffic volumes. 
(c)  A capacity analysis of the study intersections shall be completed as part of the TIA. The time period of the analysis is based on the characteristics of the development and may include the a.m. and p.m. peak period of the development, a.m. and p.m. peak period of the adjacent street, or a weekend peak period. Multiple analysis periods may be selected. The years to be included in the capacity analysis are the current year, opening year of the development, and five years after the opening year of the development. Each analysis year should include both the no-build condition and build condition. 
(d)  The no-build condition is defined as the traffic volumes and operations anticipated to occur without the development's site traffic. The build condition incorporates site specific traffic anticipated to be generated by the proposed development into the no-build conditions. The capacity analysis shall be completed using the latest version of the software programs Synchro, PTV Vistro, or an approved alternative. 
(e)  A growth rate must be determined and applied to existing traffic volumes to develop future year(s) traffic volumes. The adjusted volumes should to be used in conducting the no-build conditions capacity analysis. The growth rate is typically developed based on historical trends and must be approved by the city. 
(f)  The capacity analysis results should indicate the overall intersection level of service (LOS) and delay values at the signalized intersections. At unsignalized intersections, the stop controlled approach(s) LOS and delay values should be shown. 
(g)  A queuing analysis at the site driveways and study intersections should be included within the TIA. The purpose of the queuing analysis is to determine if the queue is anticipated to intrude or "spillback" into adjacent through lanes. The 95th percentile queue length should be utilized to determine if spillback is anticipated to occur. 
(h)  The proposed driveway(s) must follow the city's spacing requirements. The TIA should confirm that these requirements are met and a sight distance analysis should be completed for all proposed driveways, if required. The sight distance analysis shall be based on the latest version of "A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets" by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 
(i)  If required, a roadway capacity analysis should be completed for roadways within the study area. The roadway capacity analysis should follow procedures and methodologies outlined in the latest version of the "Highway Capacity Manual" by the Transportation Research Board. 
( Ord. No. 2017-05-01, 5-1-2017 ) 
Sec. 8-56. - Mitigation measures and roughly proportionate determination. 
(a)  Mitigation measures shall be recommended if adverse impact to the surrounding roadway network is anticipated. An adverse impact occurs when the LOS is anticipated to fall below LOS C. If the no-build condition's LOS is D, E, or F, the delay value must not increase by more than ten percent. If the delay value increases by more than ten percent, mitigation measures shall be recommended. The mitigation measures shall improve the level of service to a similar LOS as the no-build conditions, i.e. LOS C or within ten percent of the delay value. Traffic signal re-timing is not considered an acceptable mitigation measure unless required for geometric changes to an intersection or as approved by the city. 
(b)  In some circumstances, an intersection is "built-out." An intersection is typically considered "built-out" when the number of through lanes is consistent with the ultimate configuration of the roadway and include dual left turn lanes and a dedicated right turn lanes on all approaches. If an intersection is considered "built-out," mitigation measures are not "feasible." The city will determine if the mitigation measures are feasible or not. If no mitigation measures are feasible to improve the level of service to a similar LOS as the no-build conditions, this information should be stated within the TIA. 
(c)  A roughly proportionate determination must be completed according to the City of Castle Hill's standards and methodology, which shall follow the standards and methodology selected by the city staff and/or engineer, and which may be the standards and methodology for the City of San Antonio. A roughly proportionate determination is to establish if the proposed mitigation measures are reasonable and appropriate for the development. 
( Ord. No. 2017-05-01, 5-1-2017 ) 
Sec. 8-57. - Submittal and review 
(a)  All TIAs shall be prepared by an engineer licensed by the Texas Board of Professional Engineers and be submitted to the city for review. The submittal must include one hard copy of the document and a USB flash drive or CD containing a pdf of the TIA and all supporting electronic analysis files such as Synchro or PTV Vistro files. The document shall include either an interim seal or a final seal and signature of the engineer. 
(b)  The city will review the submittal and provide any comments, if needed. If review comments are provided, the applicant must address the comments and resubmit for a secondary review. A secondary review will be performed and there may be additional comments based on that review. This process will continue until all concerns of the city staff have been satisfied. Furthermore, the TIA must be a factor to be considered by the architectural review committee for projects referred to it. The TIA cannot be submitted to the architectural review committee until all concerns of the city staff have been satisfied. 
(c)  The approved TIA is valid for five years unless land uses or densities of the development differ from those assumed in the TIA. If land use(s) or densities of the development change, the TIA must be resubmitted for approval. 
( Ord. No. 2017-05-01, 5-1-2017 ) 
Sec. 8-58. - Public and private schools. 
    All new public and private schools shall follow the practices recommended in the latest version of the "Traffic Operations and Safety at Schools: Recommended Guidelines" prepared by the Texas Department of Transportation Research and Technology Implementation Office in cooperation with the Texas Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the Federal Highway Administration.

Note- Renumbered from § 8-52 by Ord. No. 2017-05-01, adopted May 1, 2017 . 
Sec. 8-60. - Final review by city council. 
    Upon receipt of the written report of recommendations with supporting findings from the architectural review committee, the city council will review such report and either refer the report to the building official to begin the building permitting process, with or without modification, or refer the report back to the architectural review committee for further evaluation as specifically required by the city council with a request for a supplemental report. This process shall continue until the city council is satisfied and the building permitting process is allowed to begin. Once authorized to proceed by the city council, the building official may accept any applications for building permits which are consistent with the city council's instructions to proceed. However, approval of the designed project by the city council does not waive any requirements the applicant has under any other law, including but not limited to the city's adopted building, electrical, plumbing and maintenance codes.

b.  Permanent structures such as buildings; and/or 
c.  Permanent stabilization measures such a pavement, riprap, or gabions. 
(2)  For individual lots in a residential construction site, final stabilization may be achieved only by the homebuilder completing final stabilization as specified in condition (1) above. 
(3)  For construction activities on land used for agricultural purposes (e.g. pipelines across crop or range land), final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural use. 
(4)  For construction activities on land that was not previously used for agricultural activities, such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface water and areas that are not being returned to their preconstruction agricultural use, final stabilization can be achieved only by meeting the conditions of (1) above. 
(5)  For the event of drought, final stabilization can be achieved only when all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and both of the following criteria have been met:

( Ord. No. 1119, (att.), 4-8-2014 ) 
Sec. 16-136. - Storm water pollution prevention plan (SWP3). 
(a)  General requirements. 
(1)  Storm water pollution prevention plans must be prepared for the purpose of limiting pollutants in discharges from small and large construction activities that will reach MS4s and privately-owned separate storm sewer systems. The SWP3 must also identify and address potential sources of pollution (including off-site material storage areas, overburden and stockpiles of dirt, borrow areas, equipment staging areas, vehicle repair areas, fueling areas, and etc.) that are reasonably expected to affect the quality of construction site discharges. The SWP3 must describe the practices that will be used to minimize, to the extent practicable, the discharge of construction-related pollutants in storm water and certain non-storm water discharges. 
(2)  SWP3s must utilize temporary and permanent BMPs, measures, and controls complying with the city's technical guidance manual. 
(3)  SWP3s require maps and or drawings. The scale of the maps and drawings must be large enough to provide a clear understanding of the site and the project. Sheet sizes must not exceed 24 inches by 36 inches. Where the amount of information required to be included on the map would result in a single map being difficult to read and interpret, the operator shall develop a series of maps that collectively include the required information. 
(4)  SWP3s must list MS4s receiving discharges from the subject construction activity. The same MS4s must receive copies of the SWP3 and application submittal. 
(5)  Shared SWP3 development. 
a.  For more effective coordination of BMPs and opportunities for cost sharing, a cooperative effort by the different operators at a site is encouraged. Operators must independently obtain authorization, but may work together to prepare and implement a single, comprehensive SWP3 for the entire construction site. 
b.  The SWP3 must clearly list the name and, for large construction activities, the permit authorization numbers, for each operator that participates in the shared SWP3. Until the city responds to receipt of the NOI with a permit authorization number, the SWP3 must specify the date that the NOI was submitted to the city by each operator. Each operator participating in the shared plan must also sign the SWP3. 
c.  The SWP3 must clearly indicate which operator is responsible for satisfying each shared requirement of the SWP3. If the responsibility for satisfying a requirement is not described in the plan, then each permittee is entirely responsible for meeting the requirement within the boundaries of the construction site where it performs construction activities. The SWP3 must clearly describe responsibilities for meeting each requirement in shared or common areas. 
d.  Individual operators may develop separate SWP3s that apply only to their portion of the project, provided reference is made to the other operators working on the site. Where there is more than one SWP3 for a site, permittees must coordinate to ensure that BMPs and controls are consistent and do not negate or impair the effectiveness of other controls. Regardless of whether a single comprehensive SWP3 is developed or separate SWP3s are developed for each operator, it is the responsibility of each operator to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of this article in the areas of the construction site where that operator has control over construction plans and specifications or day-to-day operations. 
(b)  Small and large construction activities. For small and large construction activities, the SWP3 must include, at a minimum: 
(1)  A site or project description, which includes the following information: 
a.  The address and lot description of the site; 
b.  A description of the nature of the construction activity; 
c.  A list of potential pollutants and their sources; 
d.  A description of the best management practices (BMPs) that will be used to minimize pollution in runoff; 
e.  The intended schedule or sequence of activities that will disturb soils for major portions of the site; the schedule of sequence must provide dates for beginning and ending construction activities such as stripping and clearing, rough grading, installing utilities, constructing infrastructure, constructing buildings, final grading, landscaping, and installing erosion and sediment controls including temporary and permanent measures; 
f.  The total number of acres of the entire project property and the total number of acres where construction activities will occur, including off-site material storage areas, overburden and stockpiles of dirt, and borrow areas that are authorized under the permittee's NOI; 
g.  Data describing the soil or the quality of any discharge from the site; 
h.  Seeding mixtures and rates, types of seed, method of seedbed preparation, expected seeding dates, type and rate of mineral and fertilizer, kind and quantity of mulching for both temporary and permanent vegetative control measures; and 
i.  A maintenance plan for BMPs. 
(2)  A general map showing the location of the site; 
(3)  A detailed topographic site map (or maps) indicating the following: 
a.  North arrow; 
b.  Identifying property lines; 
c.  Easements; 
d.  Access to the site; 
e.  Existing site conditions; 
f.  The areas and extent of proposed soil disturbance; 
g.  Proposed project conditions; 
h.  Conveyances and watercourses; 
i.  Drainage patterns and approximate slopes anticipated after major grading activities; 
j.  Locations of all planned or in-place structural controls; 
k.  Locations of temporary and permanent stabilization measures; 
l.  Locations of construction support activities, including off-site activities, that are authorized under the permittee's NOI, including material, waste, borrow, fill, equipment storage, asphalt plants, and concrete plants; 
m.  Surface waters (including wetlands) either at, adjacent to, or in close proximity to the site; 
n.  Locations where stormwater discharges from the site directly to a surface water body or MS4; and 
o.  Vehicle wash areas. 
( Ord. No. 1119, (att.), 4-8-2014 ) 
Sec. 16-137. - Maintenance and inspection of controls. 
(a)  Maintenance of controls. 
(1)  All protective measures identified in the SWP3 must be maintained in effective operating condition. If, through inspections or other means, the permittee determines that BMPs are not operating effectively, then the permittee shall perform maintenance as necessary to maintain the continued effectiveness of stormwater controls, and prior to the next rain event if feasible. If maintenance prior to the next anticipated storm event is impracticable, the reason shall be documented in the SWP3 and maintenance must he scheduled and accomplished as soon as practicable. Erosion and sediment controls that have been intentionally disabled, run over, removed, or otherwise rendered ineffective must be replaced or corrected immediately upon discovery. 
(2)  If periodic inspections or other information indicates a control has been used incorrectly, is performing inadequately, or is damaged, then the operator must replace or modify the control as soon as practicable after making the discovery. 
(3)  Sediment must be removed from sediment traps and sedimentation ponds no later than the time that design capacity has been reduced by 50 percent. For perimeter controls such as silt fences, berms, etc., the trapped sediment must be removed before it reaches 50 percent of the above-ground height. 
(4)  If sediment escapes the site, accumulations must be removed at a frequency that minimizes off-site impacts, and prior to the next rain event, if feasible. If the permittee does not own or operate the off-site conveyance, then the permittee must work with the owner or operator of the property to remove the sediment. 
(b)  Inspection of controls. 
(1)  Personnel provided by the permittee must inspect disturbed areas of the construction site that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, discharge locations, and structural controls for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system. Personnel conducting these inspections must be knowledgeable of this article, any permit issued under it, and the TCEQ general construction permit, familiar with the construction site, and knowledgeable of the SWP3 for the site. Sediment and erosion control measures identified in the SWP3 must be inspected to ensure that they are operating correctly. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site must be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking. Inspections must be conducted at least once every 14 calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of a storm event of 0.5 inches or greater. 
(2)  Where sites have been finally or temporarily stabilized or where runoff is unlikely due to winter conditions (e.g., site is covered with snow, ice, or frozen ground exists), inspections must be conducted at least once every month. 
(3)  As an alternative to the above-described inspection schedule of once every 14 calendar days and within 24 hours of a storm event of 0.5 inches or greater, the SWP3 may be developed to require that these inspections will occur at least once every seven calendar days. If this alternative schedule is developed, then the inspection must occur on a specifically defined day, regardless of whether or not there has been a rainfall event since the previous inspection. The inspections may occur on either schedule provided that the SWP3 reflects the current schedule and that any changes to the schedule are conducted in accordance with the following provisions: the schedule may be changed a maximum of one time each month, the schedule change must be implemented at the beginning of a calendar month, and the reason for the schedule change must be documented in the SWP3 (e.g., end of "dry" season and beginning of "wet" season). 
(4)  In the event of flooding or other uncontrollable situations which prohibit access to the inspection sites, inspections must be conducted as soon as access is practicable. 
(5)  The SWP3 must be modified based on the results of inspections, as necessary, to better control pollutants in runoff. Revisions to the SWP3 must be completed within seven calendar days following the inspection. If existing BMPs are modified or if additional BMPs are necessary, an implementation schedule must be described in the SWP3 and wherever possible those changes implemented before the next storm event, If implementation before the next anticipated storm event is impracticable, these changes must be implemented as soon as practicable. 
(6)  A report summarizing the scope of the inspection, the date(s) of the inspection, and major observations relating to the implementation of the SWP3 must be made and retained as part of the SWP3. Major observations should include: the locations of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from the site; locations of BMPs that need to be maintained; locations of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate for a particular location; and locations where additional BMPs arc needed. 
(7)  Actions taken as a result of inspections must be described within, and retained as a part of, the SWP3. Reports must identify any incidents of non-compliance. Where a report does not identify any incidents of non-compliance, the report must contain a certification that the facility or site is in compliance with the SWP3 and this permit. The report must be signed by the person and in the manner required by 30 TAC 305.128 (relating to signatories to reports). The names and qualifications of personnel making the inspections for the permittee may be documented once in the SWP3 rather than being included in each report.

(g)  Posting site notice. All operators and permittees must post a site notice. The site notice must be located where it is safely and readily available for viewing by the general public, local, state, end federal authorities prior to commencing construction, and must be maintained in that location until completion of the construction activity. 
(h)  Secondary operators. All secondary operators are regulated under this ordinance, but are not required to submit an NOI, provided that another operator(s) at the site has submitted an NOI, or is required to submit an NOI and the secondary operator has provided notification to the primary operators) of the need to obtain coverage (with records of notification available upon request). Any secondary operator notified under this provision may alternatively submit an NOI under this article as set forth above, may seek coverage under an alternative TPDES individual permit, or may seek coverage under an alternative TPDES general permit if available. 
(i)  Date of coverage. Operators of construction activities are authorized and their construction activities are permitted after the required submittals are received by the city, reviewed by the city, and written notification, including a stamped SWP3 and city authorization number are issued by the city to the operator/permittee. 
(j)  Late NOI's. Operators are not prohibited from submitting late NOIs or posting late notices to obtain authorization under this article. The city reserves the right to take appropriate enforcement actions for any unpermitted activities that may have occurred between the time construction commenced and authorization was obtained. 
(k)  Notice of change (NOC). 
(1)  If relevant information provided in the NOI changes, the following items must be submitted: 
a.  For small construction activities. An NOC at least ten calendar days prior to the change occurring; and 
b.  For large construction activities. An NOC at least 14 calendar days prior to the change occurring. 
(2)  When the required advance notice is not possible, the operator must submit an NOC within 14 days of discovery of the change. If the operator becomes aware that it failed to submit any relevant facts or submitted incorrect information in an NOI, the correct information must be provided to the city manager or interim city manager, the city engineer, or city building official in an NOC within 14 days after discovery. The NOC shall be submitted on a form provided by the city manager or interim city manager, the city engineer, or city building official, or by letter if an NOC form is not available. A copy of the NOC must also be provided to the operator of any MS4 receiving the discharge, most notably the city. 
(3)  Information that may be included in an NOC includes, but is not limited to, the following; the description of the construction project, an increase in the number of acres disturbed (for increases of one or more acres), and the operator name. A transfer of operational control from one operator to another, including a transfer of the ownership of a company, must be included in an NOC. A transfer of ownership of a company includes changes to the structure of a company, such as changing from a partnership to a corporation or changing corporation types, so that the filing number (or charter number) that is on record with the Texas Secretary of State must be changed. An NOC is not required for notifying the city of a decrease in the number of acres disturbed. This information must be included in the storm water pollution prevention plan (SWP3) and retained on site. 
(l)  Signatory requirements. Signatory requirement for NOI forms, notice of termination (NOT) forms, NOC letters, and construction site notices. NOI forms, NOT forms, NOC letters, and construction site notices that require a signature must be signed according to 30 TAC § 305.44 (relating to signatories for applications). 
(m)  Inspection by city. The city engineer, the city building official, or his/her/their designated agent, shall make inspections as hereinafter required and either shall approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with the stormwater pollution prevention plan as approved. Plans for grading, stripping, excavating, and filling work and an SWP3 bearing the stamp of city approval shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the work. To obtain inspections, the permittee shall notify the city engineer or the city building official at least three working days before the following: 
(1)  Start of construction. 
(2)  Installation of sediment and erosion measures. 
(3)  Completion of site clearing. 
(4)  Completion of rough grading. 
(5)  Completion of final grading. 
(6)  Close of the construction season. 
(7)  Completion of final landscaping. 
(n)  Permittee inspections. The permittee or his/her agent shall make regular inspections of all control measures in accordance with the inspection schedule outlined on the approved stormwater pollution prevention plans). The purpose of such inspections will be to determine the overall effectiveness of the stormwater pollution prevention plan and the need for additional control measures. All inspections shall be documented on forms provided by the city and submitted to the city engineer or the city building official at the time interval specified in the approved permit. 
(o)  Entry permitted. The city manager or interim city manager, the city council of castle hills, the city engineer, the building official, or their designated agents shall be permitted to enter the construction site or disturbed area as deemed necessary to make inspections to ensure the validity of the reports filed by the permittee. 
(p)  Refusal of access. If the city manager or interim city manager, city engineer, city building official, or his/her/their designee, has been refused access to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city manager or interim city manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(q)  Post-construction discharges. Discharges that occur after construction activities have been completed, and after the construction site and any supporting activity site have undergone final stabilization, are not eligible for coverage under a permit issued in accordance with this article. Discharges originating from permitted sites are not authorized under this article following the submission of the notice of termination (NOT) for the construction activity. 
(r)  Prohibition of non-storm water discharges. Except as otherwise provided, only discharges that are composed entirely of stormwater associated with construction activity may be authorized under this article. 
(s)  Compliance with water quality standards. Discharges to surface water in the city that would cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards or that would fail to protect and maintain existing designated uses are not eligible for coverage under this article. The city manager or interim city manager, city building official, or city engineer may require an application for a TPDES individual permit to authorize discharges to surface water in the state from any activity that is determined to cause a violation of water quality standards or is found to cause, or contribute to, the loss of a designated use. the city manager or interim city manager, the city engineer, or city building official may also require an application for a TPDES individual permit considering factors described in sections 16-136 and 16-137 of this article. 
(t)  Discharges to water quality-impaired receiving waters. New sources or new discharges of the constituents of concern to impaired waters are not authorized by a permit granted under this article unless otherwise allowable under 30 TAC Chapter 305 and applicable state law. Impaired waters are those that do not meet applicable water quality standards and are listed on the EPA approved Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list. Constituents of concern are those for which the water body is listed as impaired. Discharges of the constituents of concern to impaired water bodies for which there is a total maximum daily load (TMDL) are not eligible for a permit unless they are consistent with the approved TMDL. Permittees must incorporate the limitations, conditions, and requirements applicable to their discharges, including monitoring frequency and reporting required by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) rules, into their storm water pollution prevention plan in order to be eligible for coverage under this article. 
(u)  Discharges to specific watersheds and water quality areas. Discharges otherwise eligible for coverage cannot be authorized by this article where prohibited by 30 TAC Chapter 311 (relating to watershed protection) for water quality areas and watersheds. 
(v)  Protection of streams and watersheds by other governmental entities. This article does not limit the authority or ability of federal, state, or other local governmental entities from placing additional or more stringent requirements on construction activities or discharges from construction activities. 
(w)  Oil and gas production. Stormwater runoff from construction activities associated with the exploration, development, or production of oil or gas or geothermal resources, including transportation of crude oil or natural gas by pipeline, are not under the authority of the city and arc not eligible for coverage under this article. If discharges of storm water require authorization under federal NPDES regulations, authority for these discharges must be obtained from the EPA.

Chapter 19 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1122, adopted April 8, 2014, repealed the former flood damage prevention ordinance of the city, uncodified Ord. No. 1051, adopted Aug. 10, 2010, and enacted new provisions as herein set out. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 19-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water Code, Section 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of the City of Castle Hills, Texas does ordain as follows. 
( Ord. No. 1122, (att., Art. I, § A), 4-8-2014 ) 
Sec. 19-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Castle Hills, Texas are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
( Ord. No. 1122, (att., Art. I, § B), 4-8-2014 ) 
Sec. 19-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
( Ord. No. 1122, (att., Art. I, § C), 4-8-2014 ) 
Sec. 19-4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
( Ord. No. 1122, (att., Art. I, § D), 4-8-2014 ) 
Sec. 19-5. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one-percent annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/Ah, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one-percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed rate making has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE). The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for Zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one-percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year-also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is FEMA's comment on a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area (SFHA). The letter does not revise an effective NFIP map, it indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would be recognized by FEMA. FEMA charges a fee for processing a CLOMR to recover the costs associated with the review. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building, which has its lowest elevated floor, raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

    Flood insurance study (FIS). See "flood elevation study." 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.

    Letter of map revision (LOMR) is FEMA's modification to an effective flood insurance rate map (FIRM). LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations (BFEs), or the special flood hazard area (SFHA). The LOMR officially revises the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and sometimes the Flood insurance study (FIS) report, and when appropriate, includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.

    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. The floodway is congruent with the base flood floodplain in the City of Castle Hills. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area. See "area of special flood hazard." 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 19-23(c) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (section 19-3). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(10)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in subsections 19-24(a)-(i) are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
i.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
ii.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

Sec. 19-34. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 19-7, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least one foot greater than the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or

DIVISION 3. - CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS 

Sec. 40-149. - Preparation of subgrade. 
(a)  The subgrade shall be shaped in conformity to the lines and grades established by the plans by removal of existing material or addition of approved material. Material removed in one area may be utilized in the addition of material to the subgrade in another area if approved by the city engineer. All material required for completion of the subgrade shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer. 
(b)  Remove all unstable or otherwise objectionable material of the subgrade and replace with approved materials. Fill all holes, ruts, and depressions with approved material, and, if required, thoroughly wet the subgrade with water, reshape, and roll to the extent directed in order to place the subgrade in an acceptable condition to receive the base material. 
(c)  Rock Cuts. Excavate to finished subgrade elevation. Manipulate and compact subgrade in accordance with (e) below, unless excavation is to clean homogenous rock at finished subgrade elevation. If excavation extends below finished subgrade, use approved material compacted in accordance with (e) below to replace undercut material. 
(d)  Earth cuts. Scarify all earth cuts to a uniform depth of at least 6-inches below the required finished subgrade elevation. Compact the scarified subgrade in accordance with (e) below. 
(e)  Compaction. Subgrade materials shall be compacted to the required density and moisture content as shown below, unless otherwise shown on the plans: 
PI Range Density Moisture Content PI = 20 = 95% of Max. Dry Density -2% of Opt. or greater PI > 20 = 95% of Max. Dry Density = Opt. Moisture  
  
(1)  Determine maximum dry density and optimum moisture content in accordance with TxDOT Test Method Tex-114-E. Test for in-place density in accordance with TxDOT Test Method Tex-115-E and within 24 hours after compacting operations are completed. If the material fails to meet the density specified, re-work it as necessary to obtain the density required. 
(2)  For materials with a PI > 20, test the top three inches of compacted subgrade for density and moisture content just prior to placing any base materials or stabilization. If tests show the density to be more than two percent below the specified minimum or the moisture content to be more than three percent above or below the optimum, rework the course as necessary to obtain the specified compaction and moisture content. 
(3)  If the material used to replace undercuts or unsuitable material contains more than 30 percent oversize fraction (i.e. 30% or more retained on the 3/4-inch sieve) or is gap-graded (many large particles with limited small particles), the maximum density determined by Tex-114-E may not be appropriate for field compaction. If this situation is encountered, the city engineer may elect to accept the material without density testing. With the approval of the city engineer, place layers in loose lifts not to exceed 12 inches. Before and during rolling operations, bring each layer to the moisture content directed. Compact each layer until there is no evidence of further consolidation. Maintain a level layer to aid in uniform compaction. If the required stability or finish is lost for any reason, re-compact. 
(4)  Compact trenches installed in conformance to this specification. 
(f)  Tolerances. Finish the surface of the subgrade to the lines and grades as shown on the plans. Correct any deviation in excess of one-half-inch in cross section and in a length of 16-feet measured longitudinally by loosening, adding, or removing material, reshaping and compacting by sprinkling and rolling in accordance with (e) above. 
(g)  Quality control. After each layer of embankment or select material is complete, test as necessary to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. If the material fails to meet the density specified, the course shall be reworked, as necessary, to obtain the specified compaction. Should the subgrade, due to any reason or cause, lose the required stability, density, or moisture content as described in (e) above or finish before the pavement is placed, it shall be re-compacted in accordance with (e) above. Prevent excessive loss of moisture in the subgrade by sprinkling, sealing, or covering with a subsequent layer of asphaltic or other approved material. 
( Ord. No. 1121, (att.), 4-8-2014 ) 
Sec. 40-150. - Flexible base course. 
(a)  Construct a base course for surfacing, pavement, or other base courses composed of crushed stone, and constructed as herein specified in one or more courses in conformance with the typical sections shown on the plans. 
(b)  Furnish uncontaminated materials of uniform quality. Flexible base shall be TxDOT Type A, Grade 1 or Grade 2. Modifications, such as the addition of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) will be considered on a case by case basis. 
(c)  Notify the city engineer of the proposed material sources and of changes to material sources. The city engineer may sample and test project materials at any time to assure specification compliance. Use the TxDOT standard laboratory test procedure Tex-100-E for material definitions. 
(d)  Construct each layer uniformly, free of loose or segregated areas, and with the required density and moisture content. Provide a smooth surface that conforms to the typical sections, lines, and grades shown on the plans or as directed. 
(e)  Spread and shape flexible base into a uniform layer with an approved spreader the same day as delivered unless otherwise approved. Construct layers to the thickness shown on the plans. Maximum lift thickness shall be 10 inches of loose material. Maintain the shape of the course. Control dust by sprinkling, as directed. Correct or replace segregated areas as directed. Place successive base courses and finish courses using the same construction methods required for the first course. 
(f)  Compact in courses not to exceed eight inches compacted depth using density control unless otherwise shown on the plans. Multiple lifts are permitted when shown on the plans or approved. Bring each layer to the moisture content directed. When necessary, sprinkle the material in accordance with TxDOT Item 204, "Sprinkling." 
(g)  Compact to at least 95 percent of the maximum density determined by TxDOT's standard laboratory test procedure Tex-113-E unless otherwise shown on the plans. Determine the moisture content of the material at the beginning and during compaction in accordance with TxDOT's standard laboratory test procedure Tex-103-E. 
(h)  After completing compaction, clip, skin, or tight-blade the surface with a maintainer or subgrade trimmer to a depth of approximately one-quarter inch. Remove loosened material and dispose of it at an approved location. Seal the clipped surface immediately by rolling with a pneumatic tire roller until a smooth surface is attained. Add small increments of water as needed during rolling. Shape and maintain the course and surface in conformity with the typical sections, lines, and grades as shown on the plans or as directed. 
(i)  In areas where surfacing is to be placed, correct grade deviations greater than one-quarter inch in 16 feet measured longitudinally or greater than one-quarter inch over the entire width of the cross-section. Correct by loosening, adding, or removing material. Reshape and re-compact. 
(j)  Cure the finished section until the moisture content is at least three percentage points below and above optimum or as directed before applying the next successive course or prime coat.

(5)  Rollers. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, rollers shall be the Pneumatic Tire type. 
(c)  Weather. Do not place surface treatments when, in the city engineer's opinion, general weather conditions are unsuitable. 
(d)  Standard temperature limitations. Apply surface treatment when air temperature is above 50°F and rising. Do not apply surface treatment when air temperature is 60°F and falling. In all cases, do not apply surface treatment when surface temperature is below 60°F. 
(e)  Polymer-modified asphalt cement temperature limitations. When using materials described in TxDOT Item 300, Section 2.B, "Polymer Modified Asphalt Cement," apply surface treatment when air temperature is above 70°F rising. Do not apply surface treatment when air temperature is 80°F and falling. In all cases, do not apply surface treatment when surface temperature is below 70°F. 
(f)  Surface preparation. Remove existing raised pavement markers. Repair any damage incurred by removal as directed. Remove dirt, dust, or other harmful material before sealing. 
(g)  Place building paper over all manholes, valve boxes, grates, etc., so as to protect the surfaces from asphaltic materials. Asphaltic materials shall not be placed, lapped, or splashed onto adjacent structures. 
(h)  Asphalt placement. 
(1)  General. Adjust the shot width so operations do not encroach on traffic or interfere with the traffic control plan, as directed. Use paper or other approved material at the beginning and end of each shot to construct a straight transverse joint and to prevent overlapping of the asphalt. Unless otherwise approved, match longitudinal joints with the lane lines. The city engineer may require a string line if necessary to keep joints straight with no overlapping. Use sufficient pressure to flare the nozzles fully. In those areas where the asphalt distributor is not accessible, hand spraying may be permitted by the city engineer. Select an application temperature, as approved. Uniformly apply the asphalt material at the rate shown on the plans or as directed by the city engineer, within 15°F of the approved temperature, and not above the maximum allowable temperature. 
(2)  Limitations. Do not apply asphalt to the roadway until: 
i.  Traffic control methods and devices are in place as shown on the plans or as directed; 
ii.  The loaded aggregate spreader is in position and ready to begin; 
iii.  Haul trucks are loaded with enough aggregate to cover the shot area; and 
iv.  Haul trucks are in place behind the spreader box. 
(3)  Non-uniform applications. Stop application if it is not uniform due to streaking, ridging, puddling, or flowing off the roadway surface. Verify equipment condition, operating procedures, application temperature, and material properties. Determine and correct the cause of non-uniform application. If the cause is high or low emulsion viscosity, replace emulsion with material that corrects the problem. 
(4)  Test strips. The city engineer may stop asphalt application and require construction of test strips at the contractor's expense if any of the following occurs: 
i.  Non-uniformity of application continues after corrective action; 
ii.  On three consecutive shots, application rate differs by more than 0.03 gallons per square yard from the rate directed; or 
iii.  Any shot differs by more than 0.05 gallons per square yard from the rate directed. 
The city engineer will approve the test strip location. The city engineer may require additional test strips until surface treatment application meets specification requirements. 
(i)  Aggregate placement. As soon as possible, apply aggregate uniformly at the rate directed without causing the rock to roll over. 
(j)  Rolling. Start rolling operation on each shot as soon as aggregate is applied. Use sufficient rollers to cover the entire mat width in one pass, i.e., one direction. Roll in a staggered pattern. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, make a minimum of: 
(1)  Five passes; or 
(2)  Three passes when the asphalt material is an emulsion. 
If rollers are unable to keep up with the spreader box, stop application until rollers have caught up, or furnish additional rollers. Keep roller tires asphalt-free. 
(k)  Patching. Before rolling, repair spots where coverage is incomplete. Repair can be made by hand spotting or other approved method. When necessary, apply additional asphalt material to embed aggregate. 
(l)  Brooming. After rolling, sweep as soon as aggregate has sufficiently bonded to remove excess. After rolling of the finished surface is completed, all parkways, private property, and driveways adjacent to the work shall be cleared of any surplus aggregate by the Contractor by sweeping. Prevent loose aggregate from creating a hazard to traffic. 
(m)  Two-course surface treatments. It is the intent of this specification that the application of asphalt and aggregate for multiple courses be applied within the same day, or immediately thereafter, and prior to opening the roadway to traffic. Apply asphaltic material for each course of the surface treatment and cover with aggregate in the same manner specified for the first application. Each surface shall then be broomed or raked and thoroughly rolled as specified for the first course. Asphaltic material and aggregate for each course shall be applied at the rates directed by the city engineer or as shown on the plans. 
(n)  Repair all holes or failures in the surface by use of additional asphalt and aggregate. Cover all fat or bleeding surfaces with approved cover material in such a manner that the asphaltic material will not adhere to or be picked up by the wheels of vehicles.

(2)  Temperature conditions. The asphaltic mixture, when placed with a motor grader, shall not be placed when the surface temperature is below 65°F and is falling, but may be placed when the surface temperature is above 55°F and is rising. The maximum depth of asphalt mixture placed with a motor grader will not exceed five inches of compacted material. Mat thicknesses of 11/2 inches and less shall not be placed when the temperature of the surface on which the mat is to be placed is below 60°F. 
(3)  Tack coat or asphaltic mixture shall be placed only when the humidity, general weather conditions, temperature and moisture condition of the base are suitable. 
(4)  Placement temperature. If, after being discharged from the mixer and prior to placing, the temperature of the asphaltic mixture falls below 200°F, all or any part of the load may be rejected and payment will not be made for the rejected material. 
(5)  Placement operations. Prepare the surface by removing raised pavement markers and objectionable material such as moisture, dirt, sand, leaves, and other loose impediments from the surface before placing mixture. Remove vegetation from pavement edges. The asphaltic mixture shall be dumped and spread on the approved prepared surface with the spreading and finishing machine. Place the mixture to meet the typical section requirements and produce a smooth, finished surface with a uniform appearance and texture. In addition, the placing of the asphaltic mixture shall be completed without tearing, shoving, gouging or segregating the mixture and without producing streaks in the mat. Unloading into the finishing machine shall be controlled so that bouncing or jarring the spreading and finishing machine shall not occur and the required lines and grades shall be obtained without resorting to hand finishing. When approved by the city engineer, level-up courses may be spread with a motor grader. Construction joints of successive courses of asphaltic material shall be offset at least six inches. Construction joints on surface courses shall coincide with lane lines, or as directed by the city engineer. The spreading and finishing machine shall be operated at a uniform forward speed consistent with the plant production rate, hauling capability, and roller train capacity to result in a continuous operation. The speed shall be slow enough that stopping between trucks is not ordinarily required. If, in the opinion of the Inspector, sporadic delivery of material is adversely affecting the mat, the Inspector may require paving operations to cease until acceptable methods are provided to minimize starting and stopping of the paver. The hopper flow gates of the spreading and finishing machine shall be adjusted to provide an adequate and consistent flow of material. These shall result in enough material being delivered to the augers so that they are operating approximately 85 percent of the time or more. The augers shall provide means to supply adequate flow of material to the center of the paver. Augers shall supply an adequate flow of material for the full width of the mat, as approved by the city engineer. Augers should be kept approximately one-half to three-quarters full of mixture at all times during the paving operation. If a pattern of surface irregularities or segregation is detected, the contractor shall make an investigation into the causes and immediately take the necessary action. With the approval of the inspector, placement may continue for no more than one full production day from the time the Contractor is first notified and while corrective actions are being taken. Place mixture within the compacted lift thickness shown in Table 8, unless otherwise shown on the plans or allowed. Use the guidelines in Table 9 to establish the temperature of mixture delivered to the paver.

(r)  Compaction. The pavement shall be compacted thoroughly and uniformly with the necessary rollers to obtain the compaction and cross section of the finished paving mixture meeting the requirements of the plans and specifications. The edges of the pavement along curbs, headers and similar structures, and all places not accessible to the roller, or in such positions as will not allow thorough compaction with the rollers, shall be thoroughly compacted with lightly oiled tamps. Rolling with a trench roller will be required on widened areas, in trenches and other limited areas where satisfactory compaction cannot be obtained with the approved rollers. All rolling for compaction shall be completed before the mixture temperature drops below 175°F. 
(s)  Quality control and acceptance. Control and acceptance of hot mixed asphaltic concrete pavement shall be followed as specified herein or as directed on the plans. The contractor shall conduct production and placement operations in accordance with the method specified. All testing will be conducted in accordance with the testing methods shown in Table 10.

1.  The engineer may waive the sampling and testing requirements at then discretion. 
(1)  In-place density. For every 500 tons of compacted asphaltic material or as directed by the city engineer, test the in place density. The in place density shall be in the range of 92.0% to 97.0% of the maximum density. Do not increase the asphalt content of the mixture to increase pavement density. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, obtain 2 roadway specimens at each location selected by the city engineer for in-place density determination. Unless otherwise determined, the city engineer will witness the coring operation and measurement of the core thickness. Unless otherwise approved, obtain the cores within one working day after placement is completed. Obtain two six-inch diameter cores side-by-side from within one foot of the location provided by the city engineer. For Type C, D and F mixtures, four inch diameter cores are allowed. Mark the cores for identification. Visually inspect each core and verify that the current paving layer is bonded to the underlying layer. If an adequate bond does not exist between the current and underlying layer, take corrective action to insure that an adequate bond will be achieved during subsequent placement operations. Immediately after obtaining the cores, dry the core holes and tack the sides and bottom. Fill the hole with the same type of mixture and properly compact the mixture. Repair core holes with other methods when approved. If the core heights exceed the minimum untrimmed values listed in Table 8, trim the cores within one working day following placement operations unless otherwise approved. If the core height before trimming is less than the minimum untrimmed value shown in Table 8, decide whether or not to include the pair of cores in the density determination for that sublot. If the cores are to be included in density determination, trim the cores. If the cores will not be included in density determination, store untrimmed cores for the city engineer. The developer's engineer will measure density in accordance with Tex-207-F and Tex-227-F. If the in-place density in the compacted mixture is below 92 percent or greater than 97 percent, change the production and placement operations to bring the in-place density within requirements. The city engineer may suspend production until the in-place density is brought to the required level, and may require a test section as described below, before proceeding. 
(2)  At the onset of production, or after production and placement operations have been altered to bring the in-place density into conformance, construct a test section of one lane-width and at most 0.2 miles in length to demonstrate that compaction to between 92.0 percent and 97.0 percent in-place density can be obtained. Continue this procedure until a test section with the correct density can be produced. The city engineer will allow only two test sections per day. When a test section producing satisfactory in-place air void content is placed, resume full production.

    An applicant is subject to reasonable police power regulation of the city to manage its public rights-of-way in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of facilities in the public rights-of-way, pursuant to the city's rights as a custodian of public property, based upon the city's historic rights under state and federal laws. Such regulations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(a)  An applicant may be required to place certain facilities within the public rights-of-way underground according to applicable city requirements absent a compelling demonstration by the applicant that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable or feasible nor is it equally applicable to other similar users of the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  An applicant shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations on other similar users of the public right-of-way. The city shall waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the applicant. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. An applicant shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(c)  An applicant may be required to obtain a WiROW permit and any other permits in addition to a WiROW permit, as reasonably required by applicable city ordinances, prior to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation or maintenance within the public right-of-way. 
(d)  Once a WiROW permit is issued, the applicant shall give to the city a minimum of 48 hours' notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any work in, on or under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the applicant to request and obtain a WiROW permit from the city prior to performing any work in, on or over any public right-of-way, except in an emergency as provided for in subsection (I) of this section, will subject the applicant to a stop work order from the city and enforcement action pursuant to the city's ordinances. If the applicant fails to act upon any permit within 30 calendar days of issuance, the WiROW permit shall become invalid, and the applicant will be required to obtain another WiROW permit. 
(e)  At the time of application submission for a WiROW permit, the city shall furnish an applicant with the PCI of the existing pavement which shall be used to determine the scope of work for the right-of-way restoration. 
(f)  When an applicant completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation or other work, the applicant shall promptly restore the rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. An applicant shall replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base, irrigation system and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance, or repair of the applicant's facilities within 30 calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the time of the work, as required in Sections 49-9, section 49-10, and section 49-11. 
(g)  Upon failure of an applicant to perform any such repair or replacement work, and five days after written notice has been given by the city to the applicant, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been disturbed by the applicant, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the applicant will reimburse the city for the costs so incurred within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(h)  The applicant shall guarantee the quality of the work and restoration performed in the public right-of-way. 
(1)  The applicant shall guarantee irrigation systems and landscape treatments for two years after completion of work in the right-of-way. Should the city reasonably determine, within two years that irrigation systems or landscape treatments require additional restoration work, the applicant shall perform such additional restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies as provided herein. 
(2)  The applicant shall guarantee repairs, for right-of-way or streets, including curbs, surface, base, trench fill, and subgrade, for the life of the street. The required financial security will be released one year after the completion of the work in the right-of-way. 
(i)  If the city determines that the failure of an applicant to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts. An applicant shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(j)  An applicant shall furnish the city with construction plans and maps showing the location and proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction at least 15 calendar days before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way. An applicant may not begin construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city engineer, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing. 
(k)  If the city manager declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, an applicant shall remove or abate the applicant's facilities by the deadline provided in the city manager's request. The applicant and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of service. If the applicant, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the applicant, without paying compensation to the applicant and without the city incurring liability for damages. 
(l)  Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent harm to property or person ("emergency conditions"), an applicant may not excavate the pavement of a street or public rights-of-way without first complying with city requirements. The city manager or his/her designee shall be notified immediately regarding work performed under such emergency conditions, and the applicant shall comply with the requirements of city standards for the restoration of the public rights-of-way. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this article, work authorized by this subsection shall be subject to all requirements of this article. 
(m)  Within 60 days of completion of each new permitted section of an applicant's facilities, the applicant shall supply the city with a complete set of "as built" drawings for the segment in a format used in the ordinary course of the applicant's business and as reasonably prescribed by the city, and as allowed by law. New facilities less than 25 feet in length may be located by swing ties. For longer facilities, the "as-built" drawings shall include at least two coordinate points locating new facilities and at least one additional coordinate point for every 50 feet of facility length. The coordinates shall be based on a horizontal datum of NAD 83 and a vertical datum of NAVD 88.

Construction in the public right-of-way causes traffic congestion, inconvenience to vehicle and pedestrian citizen travelers, and eventual weakness of the infrastructure. The city will therefore require all applicants for a WiROW permit for placement of facilities in the public rights-of-way to endeavor to coordinate and enter into joint construction agreements of their facilities in the public rights-of-way. Once the city receives an applicant's application for a WiROW permit, the city will provide the applicant with the names, addresses and phone numbers of contact persons of other applicants for construction in the public rights-of-way. It will be the responsibility of all the applicants to coordinate with other persons in the excavation of the public rights-of-way for the installation, reconstruction, removal, relocation, maintenance, operation, or repair of their facilities. The applicants are required to use their best efforts to coordinate with each other and to provide the city with a joint construction time line. If the city has current applications for a WiROW permit pending with the city and an applicant refuses to cooperate with any other applicants for joint construction, that applicant's request for a WiROW permit shall be denied for the requisite time period. 
(o)  Except in cases of emergency, work in school zones shall not be permitted during drop off and pick up times on school days. This means no work before 9:00 a.m. or between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. For the purposes of this section, "work" shall also include lane closure, flagging or placement of barricades, The city manager shall authorize work during the above stated prohibited times when deemed necessary.

(b)  The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among competing users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each user type, and, to the extent the city can demonstrate that there is limited space available for additional users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law. 
(c)  If the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley, or public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the previously authorized user of the public rights-of-way.

(2)  Provide for 30 days' notice to the city for cancellation, non-renewal, or material change. 
(3)  Provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the city manager by certified mail.
