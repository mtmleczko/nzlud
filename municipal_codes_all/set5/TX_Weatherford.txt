PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Weatherford, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, as supplemented through October 24, 2000, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Weatherford Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The title, chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of three parts separated by a dash. The first figure before the dash refers to the title number, the second figure after the dash refers to the position of the chapter within the title, and the third figure refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 of title II is numbered 2-1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 of title XII is 12-6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with both its title and chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Historical note- The Weatherford City Charter was first adopted by the voters of Weatherford on April 23, 1918. It was amended at an election on November 20, 1949, amended a second time on October 30, 1956, amended a third time at an election held on April 4, 1981 and amended a fourth time at an election held on April 2, 1983. The Charter is printed as amended November 2, 2010. 
Prior to 1918, the City of Weatherford was a City under Texas law, but it was not a "home rule City". 
It is a matter of some interest that the group who served on the original committee to draft the City Charter were as follows: C.D. Hartnett, Henry Miller, R.K. Phillips, C.C. Barthold, Sam Shadle, F.O. McKinsey, R.W. Davies, E.A. Camp, J.H. Doss, C.A. Waller, T.R. Erwin and Prestin Martin. 
Weatherford, by its action in 1918, changed from being what is now called "general law City" to being a "home rule City". According to the Texas Home Rule Statute (V.T.C.A., Government Code ch.9), a City may become a home rule City by having an election at which a majority of the voters approve the "home rule charter". Under the provisions of Art. 974a, a home rule City has very broad powers. It can do many things. The only powers that it does not have are those powers expressly forbidden or restricted by state law, and those powers forbidden or restricted by the Charter itself. 
The 1949 amendments increased the size of the City Commission from three (a Mayor and two Commissioners) to five (a Mayor and four Commissioners). The 1956 amendments dealt with management of the Water and Electric Department. (The City electrical distribution system had been operated since June 12, 1940, under the supervision of the Mayor and City Commission, and without any special provision in the City Charter.) The 1981 amendments were in the nature of modernizing numerous specific provisions by reference to State law, correction of numbering and repeal of provisions that were completely out of date. Some of the interesting provisions that were deleted in 1981 include the following: 
a. A specific provision for sprinkling the streets with water or oil and to regulate the charge for doing this. 
b. Provisions governing the operation of the public school system, which, since 1954, has been completely separate from the City government, and operated by the Weatherford Independent School District Board of Directors. 
c. Specific Charter provisions that applied only in 1918, such as the form of the ballot, the requirement that an election be held on the fourth Tuesday of April, 1918, etc. 
d. A provision that policemen and firemen could have free transportation on street cars, etc. 
e. Several Charter provisions which, although of a serious nature, have been superseded or modified by laws enacted by the Texas Legislature. Among these are the procedure for conducting elections, the maximum interest on Municipal bonds, the collection of the poll tax, a provision that violation of any City ordinance may be punished by fifteen days in jail. 
In 1983 the amendments included changing the name of the City Commission to "City Council" and changing the name of the Electric and Water Department to "Weatherford Municipal Utility System". More detailed provisions for filling vacancies were adopted, and it was provided that the Mayor Pro Tem would be selected from all members of the City Council. Numerous short provisions that are duplicated by state law were deleted and repealed. Following the Charter amendments the Charter was renumbered so as to have consecutive numbered articles, without gaps or missing numbers. 
This "historical note" and the several short references to State law, inserted in the Charter itself, have been included with the permission of the City Council, to aid understanding of the Charter and City government operation.

In the event the ordinance or resolution is one proposed to be adopted, such electors shall be regarded as the "Initiating Committee", and in the event it is desired to repeal an ordinance or resolution already existing, such electors shall be regarded as the "Referring Committee".

    If the Council refuses to pass or repeal the proposed ordinance or resolution or passes the same in an amended form from that presented in the petition, or repeals only a part of such ordinance instead of repealing the same in the manner set out in such petition of reference, then in either event, such initiating committee, or such referring committee, or a majority thereof, may require that such ordinance or resolution, either in its original or amended form, be submitted to a vote of the electors for adoption or repeal, as the case may be. 
    When an ordinance or resolution proposed by petition is to be submitted to a vote of the electors for adoption or repeal, after the Council has acted upon the same, as provided for in the preceding paragraph, then such initiating or referring committee as the case may be, upon a majority vote of such committee, shall certify their desire to have the same submitted for adoption or repeal within twenty (20) days after the Council shall have taken action on the same, and shall file such certificate and statement with the person exercising the duties of the City Secretary. 
    After the receipt of such certificate and the certified copy of the proposed ordinance or resolution, the person exercising the duties of the City Secretary shall present such certificate and certified copy of the proposed ordinance or resolution to the Council at its next regular meeting. If any election is to be held at a date not more than ninety (90) days nor less than ten (10) days after such meeting of the Council, then such ordinance or resolution proposed for adoption or repeal shall be submitted by the Council to a vote for the electors at such election to be held, but if no such election is to be held within such time, then the Council shall provide for submitting such proposed ordinance or resolution for adoption or rejection, to the electors at a special election to be held not less than twenty (20) nor more than forty (40) days thereafter.

    The form of ballot for use in an election held for the repeal of any referred ordinance or resolution shall state the title of the ordinance or resolution and contain a succinct statement of the nature and purpose of the ordinance or resolution sought to be repealed, and below such statement, in separate lines, there shall be printed the words "FOR THE REPEAL OF THE ORDINANCE (OR RESOLUTION)-AGAINST THE REPEAL OF THE ORDINANCE (OR RESOLUTION)". If a majority of the electors voting in such election shall vote in favor of the repeal of such ordinance or resolution, then the same shall be considered repealed, when the result of such election shall have been declared.

The duty of the owner to maintain premises is not eliminated or superseded by any duty this ordinance creates in occupants or tenants of the premises. It is the intent of this ordinance that both owner and occupant shall have the duty of maintenance of premises within the City of Weatherford. 
Section 107.2 Authority Regarding Particular Substandard Buildings : Pursuant to the authority of Chapter 214 of the Texas Local Government Code, the City of Weatherford, through its duly appointed boards and/or commissions, is hereby authorized to require the vacation, relocation of occupants, securing, repair, removal or demolition of a building which is: 
1.  dilapidated or substandard such as to be unfit for human habitation and a hazard to the public health, safety and welfare; 
For purposes of this section and chapter, the term unfit for human habitation and a hazard to the public health, safety and welfare shall include, but is not limited to, buildings or structures which meet any one or more of the following criteria:

c.  Any portion of a building, structure or appurtenance that has been damaged by fire, earthquake, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect, abandonment, vandalism or by any other cause to such an extent that it is likely to partially or completely collapse, or to become detached or dislodged. 
d.  Any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance or ornamentation on the exterior thereof that is not of sufficient strength or stability, or is not so anchored, attached or fastened in place so as to be capable of resisting natural or artificial loads of one and one-half the original designed value. 
e.  The building or structure, or part of the building or structure, because of dilapidation, deterioration, decay, faulty construction, the removal or movement of some portion of the ground necessary for the support, or for any other reason, is likely to partially or completely collapse, or some portion of the foundation or underpinning of the building or structure is likely to fail or give way. 
f.  The building or structure, or any portion thereof, is clearly unsafe for its use and occupancy. 
g.

h.  Any building or structure has been constructed, exists or is maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable to such building or structure provided by the approved building or fire code of the jurisdiction, or of any law or ordinance to such an extent as to present either a substantial risk of fire, building collapse or any other threat to life and safety. 
i.  A building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, ventilation, mechanical or plumbing system, or otherwise, is determined by the code official to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation or in such a condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease.

(a)  the building constitutes a danger to the public even though secured from entry; or 
(b)  the means used to secure the building are inadequate to prevent unauthorized entry or use of the building in the manner described by Subsection 2 above. 
Section 107.3 Notice of Determination as Substandard Building . Prior to initiating any proceeding for the vacation, relocation of occupants, repair, removal or demolition of a structure determined to be in violation of any provision of Section 107.2 above, the Code Official shall forward written notice of the violations(s) by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the record owner of the property at the last known address of said owner. The written notice shall identify the violations or conditions in the structure which render it a substandard building as defined herein and shall provide a reasonable time in which the violations or conditions may be repaired and the structure brought into compliance with current applicable code requirements. 
Section 107.4 Proceedings Before the Building and Standards Commission. 
(1)  In the event of failure of the record owner of the subject building or structure to comply with the directives of the written notice required in Section 107.3 above, the Code Official, through the Office of the City Attorney, may apply to the Building and Standards Commission for an order that the building or structure be vacated, secured, repaired, removed or demolished by the owner within a reasonable time. 
(2)  Proceedings before the Building and Standards Commission shall be conducted in accord with the provisions of Title II, Chapter 6 of the City Code and the following provisions. Notice of the proceedings before the Commission shall be provided to the owner and to each mortgagee or lienholder of record on the property. Notice of a hearing before the Commission sent to an owner, lienholder or mortgagee must include a statement that the owner, lienholder or mortgagee will be required to submit at the hearing proof of the scope of any work that may be required to comply with the applicable codes and ordinances and the time it will take to reasonably perform the work. 
3.  At the public hearing to determine whether a building or structure falls within the conditions enumerated in Section 107.2 the owner, lien holder or mortgagee has the burden of proof to demonstrate the scope of any work that may be required to eliminate the violation of Section 107.2 and the time it will take to reasonably perform said work. 
4.  If the Commission determines at the public hearing that the building or structure is in violation of any provision(s) of Section 107.2, the Commission shall require owner, lienholder or mortgagee of the building or structure to, within thirty days: (1) secure the building or structure from unauthorized entry; or (2) repair, remove or demolish the building or structure, unless the owner or lienholder establishes at the hearing that the work cannot reasonably be performed within thirty (30) days. The Commission may, in its discretion, provide in its order that a mortgagee or lienholder shall have an additional reasonable period of time to comply with the order. The Commission may also order that the occupants, if any, of the structure be relocated within a reasonable time. 
5.  If the Commission allows the owner, lienholder or mortgagee more than thirty (30) days to repair, remove or demolish the building, the Commission shall establish specific time schedules for the commencement and performance of the work and shall require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to secure the property in a reasonable manner, as determined by the Commission, from unauthorized entry while the work is being performed. 
6.  The Commission may not allow the owner, lienholder or mortgagee more than ninety (90) days to repair, remove, or demolish the building or fully perform all work required to comply with the order unless the owner, lienholder or mortgagee: 
a.  submits a written detailed plan and time schedule for the work at the public hearing; and 
b.  establishes at the public hearing that the work cannot reasonably be completed within ninety (90) days due to the scope and complexity of the work required. 
If the Commission allows the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee more than ninety (90) days to complete any part of the work required to repair, remove, or demolish the building, the Commission shall require the owner, lienholder or mortgagee to regularly submit progress reports to the Code Official to demonstrate compliance with the time schedules established for commencement and completion of the work. The order may require that the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee appear before the Commission or the Code Official to demonstrate compliance with the time schedules. If the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee owns property, including structures or improvements, within the boundaries of the City of Weatherford, which exceed $100,000.00 in total value, the Commission may require the owner, lienholder, or mortgagee to post a cash or surety bond in an amount adequate to cover the cost of repairing, removing or demolishing a building under this Section. In lieu of a bond, the Commission may require the owner, lienholder or mortgagee to provide a letter of credit from a financial institution or a guaranty from a third party approved by the Commission. The bond must be posted, or the letter of credit or third party guaranty provided, not later than the 30th day after the date the Commission issues its order. 
7.  If a building or structure is not vacated, secured, repaired, removed or demolished or, if the occupants are not relocated within the time ordered by the Commission, the City may vacate, secure, remove or demolish the building at its own expense. This subsection in no way limits the ability of the City to collect on a bond or other financial guaranty that may be required by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 6 above. 
8.  If the City incurs expenses under Subsection 7, which are not reimbursed or paid by collection on a bond or other financial guaranty, the City may assess the expenses on and the municipality has a lien against, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution, the property on which the building is located. The lien is extinguished, and required to be released, if the property owner or another person have an interest in the legal title to the property reimburses the City for the expenses. The lien arises and attaches to the property at the time the notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the property is located. The notice of the lien must contain the name and address of the owner if that information can be determined with reasonable effort, a legal description of the property on which the building was located, the amount of expenses incurred by the municipality, and the balance due and owing to the City. If notice is given and the opportunity to relocate the tenants of the building or to repair, remove or demolish the building is forwarded to each lienholder or mortgagee of the building, the City's lien is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens. 
9.  Within ten (10) days after the date the Commission's order is issued, the City shall: 
a.  file a copy of the order in the office of the City Secretary; and 
b.  publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the City a notice containing: the street address or legal description of the property; the date of the hearing; a brief statement indicating the results of the order; and instructions stating where a complete copy of the order may be obtained. 
c.  After the public hearing, the City shall promptly: mail, by certified mail with return receipt requested; delivery by the United States Postal Service using signature confirmation service; or, personally deliver a copy of the Commission's order to the owner of the building and to any lienholder or mortgagee of the property. 
d.  The City shall use its best efforts to determine the identity and address of any owner, lienholder or mortgagee of the building, structure or property. 
10.  If the City mails any notice required in this Section to a property owner, lienholder, or mortgagee and the United States Postal Service returns the notice as "refused" or "unclaimed", the validity of the notice is not affected and the notice is considered delivered. 
11.  As assessment of a civil penalty under this subsection, the City Secretary must file with the District Clerk of Parker County a certified copy of an order issued under this subsection stating the amount and duration of the civil penalty. No other proof is required for a district court to enter a final judgment on the penalty. 
12.  The City satisfies the requirements of this section to make a diligent effort, to use its best efforts or to make a reasonable effort to determine the identity and address of an owner, lienholder or mortgagee if the City searches the following records: 
a.  county real property records of the county in which the building is located; 
b.  appraisal district records of the appraisal district in which the building is located; 
c. records of the secretary of state; 
d.  assumed name records of the county in which the building is located; 
e.  tax records of the municipality; 
f.  utility records of the municipality. 
Section 107.5. Additional Authority Regarding Securing of Substandard Building . 
1.  The Code Official, or his designees, may secure a building the Code Official determines is in violation of the minimum standards provided in any of the International Codes as adopted by the City of Weatherford and enumerated above and is unoccupied or is occupied only by persons who do not have a right of possession to the building. The authority granted in this subsection is in addition to the authority granted under Subsection 107.4 above. 
2.  Before the 11 th day after the date the building is secured, the Code Official shall give notice to the owner of the building by: 
a.  personally serving the owner with written notice; 
b.  depositing the notice in the United States mail addressed to the owner at the owner's post office address; 
c.  publishing the notice at least twice within a ten-day period in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the building is located if personal service cannot be effected and the owner's post office address is unknown; or 
d.  posting the notice on or near the front door of the building if personal service cannot be obtained and the owner's post office address is unknown. 
3.  Notice under this subsection must contain: 
a.  an identification, which is not required to be a legal description, of the building and the property on which it is located; 
b.  a description of the violation of the ordinance or code provisions present in the building; 
c.  a statement that the City has or will secure, as the case may be, the building; and 
d.  an statement of the owner's entitlement to request a hearing about any matter relating to the City's securing of the building. 
4.  The Building and Standards Commission shall conduct a hearing at which the owner may testify or present witnesses or written information about any matter relating to the City's securing of the building if, within thirty (30) days after the date the City secures the building, the owner files with the City Secretary's Office a written request for such hearing. The Commission shall conduct the hearing within twenty (20) days after the date the request is filed. 
5.  The City has the same authority to assess expenses under this subsection as it has to assess expenses under subsection 107.4.8. A lien is created under this subsection in the same manner that a lien is created under that subsection and is subject to the same conditions as a lien created under that subsection. 
Section 107.6 Additional Authority Regarding Repair of Substandard Building 
1.  In addition to the authority granted to the City by Section 107.4 and 107.5 above, after the expiration of the time prescribed in a Commission order under Section 107.4 for the repair, removal or demolition of a building, the City may: 
a.  Repair the building at the expense of the City and assess the expenses on the land on which the building stands or to which it is attached. Expenses incurred by the City pursuant to this section shall be recoverable in the same manner as prescribed by Section 107.4.8., or 
b.  assess a civil penalty against the property owner for the failure to repair, remove or demolish the building. 
2.  The City may repair a building under this Subsection only to the extent necessary to bring the building into compliance with the minimum standards and only if the building is a residential building with ten (10) of fewer dwelling units. The repairs may not improve the building to the extent that the building exceeds minimum standards of the residential code. 
3.  The City shall impose a lien on the land on which the building stands or stood, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution, to secure the payment of the repair or the civil penalty. Promptly after the imposition of the lien, the City shall file for record, in the recordable form in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the land is located, a written notice of imposition of the lien. This notice must contain a legal description of the land. 
4.  Except as specifically otherwise provided in Section 107.4, the City's lien to secure the payment of a civil penalty or the cost of repairs under this Subsection is inferior to any previously recorded bona fide mortgage lien attached to the real property to which the municipality's lien attaches if the mortgage lien was filed for record in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the real property is located before the date the civil penalty is assessed or the repair is begun by the City. The City's lien is superior to all other previously recorded judgment liens. 
5.  Any civil penalty or other assessment imposed under this subsection accrues interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) a year from the date of the assessment until paid in full. 
6.  The City's right to the assessment lien may not be transferred to third parties. 
7.  In any judicial proceeding regarding enforcement of municipal rights under this subsection, the prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees from the nonprevailing party. 
8.  A lien acquired under this section by a municipality for repair expenses may not be foreclosed if the property on which the repairs were made is occupied as a residential homestead by a person 65 years of age or older. 
9.  The City may, by order, assess and recover a civil penalty against a property owner at the time of a Commission hearing on violations of an ordinance, in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per day for each violation or if the owner shows that the property is the owner's lawful homestead, in an amount not to exceed $10.00 per day for each violation if the City proves: 
a.  the property owner was notified of the requirements of the code or ordinance and the owner's need to comply with the requirements; and 
b.  after notification, the property owner committed an act in violation of the ordinance or failed to take an act necessary to comply with the ordinance. 
10.  As assessment of a civil penalty under this subsection is final and binding and constitutes prima facie evidence of the penalty in any suit brought by the City in a court of competent jurisdiction for a final judgment in accord with the assessed penalty. 
11.  To enforce a civil penalty under this subsection, the City Secretary must file with the District Clerk of Parker County a certified copy of an order issued under this subsection stating the amount and duration of the civil penalty. No other proof is required for a district court to enter a final judgment on the penalty. 
Section 107.7 Judicial Review 
1.  Any owner, lienholder, or mortgagee of record of property jointly or severally aggrieved by an order of the Building and Standards Commission issued under the provisions of Section 107.4 may file in district court a verified petition setting forth that the decision of the Commission is illegal, in whole or in part, and specifying the grounds of the illegality. The petition must be filed by an owner, lienholder or mortgagee within thirty (30) calendar days after the respective dates a copy of the order of the Commission is personally delivered or mailed to them by first class mail, certified return receipt requested, or the order of the Commission shall become final as to each of them upon the expiration of each such thirty (30) day period. 
2.  On the filing of the petition, the court may issue a writ of certiorari directed to the Commission to review the order of the Commission and shall prescribe in the writ the time within which a return on the writ must be made, which time period must be longer than ten (10) days, and served on the relator or the relator's attorney. 
3.  The Commission may not be required to return the original papers acted on by it, but it is sufficient for the Commission to return certified or sworn copies of the papers or of parts of the papers as may be called for by the writ. 
4.  The return must concisely set forth other facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified. 
5.  The issuance of the writ does not stay proceedings on the order of the Commission appealed from. 
6.  Appeal in the district court shall be limited to a hearing under the substantial evidence rule. The court may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the decision brought up for review. 
7.  Costs may not be allowed against the Commission. 
8.  If the decision of the Commission is affirmed or not substantially reversed but only modified, the district court shall allow to the Commission all attorney's fees and other costs and expenses incurred by it and shall enter a judgment for those items, which may be entered against the property owner(s), lienholder(s) or mortgagee(s) as well as all persons subject to the proceedings before the Commission.

If, at the conclusion of the investigation, the animal control authority determines that the animal is a dangerous animal, as defined herein, the animal control authority shall provide notice, in writing, of that determination to the owner of the animal. The written notice may be delivered in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested, with concurrent mailing by regular mail. In the event the owner of the animal refuses the written notice by certified mail, it shall be presumed that the owner received the written notice forwarded by regular mail. 
(b)  In the event that the animal made the subject of the investigation has not been impounded pending the investigation, upon determination by the animal control authority that the animal is a dangerous animal, the written notice of that determination shall be accompanied by a written directive from the animal control authority to deliver the animal to the animal control authority, within five days of the issuance of the written notice, for agreed registration in accord with the provisions of this chapter or the determination of the municipal court regarding the disposition of the animal. 
In the event the owner fails to deliver the animal to the animal control authority as required by this subsection, the animal control authority shall request from the municipal court the issuance of warrant for seizure of the animal. The animal control authority shall, promptly upon issuance of the warrant for seizure, seize the animal and provide for its impoundment in secure and humane conditions pending the municipal court's order regarding disposition of the dog. The owner of the animal shall be responsible for all costs incurred in seizing the dog and the costs and fees for impoundment of the animal. 
(c)  The owner of an animal which has been determined by the animal control authority to be a dangerous animal may, within ten days following issuance of the written notice of the determination as a dangerous animal, appeal the determination of the animal control authority to the municipal court by filing with that court a written notice of appeal of the determination. The written notice of appeal must plainly state the grounds of the appeal of the determination and have attached a true and correct copy of the written notice issued by the animal control authority which is appealed. A written notice of determination as a dangerous animal issued by the animal control authority and not timely appealed as provided in this subsection shall be considered, in all respects, final upon the eleventh day following its issuance. 
The municipal court shall, upon receipt of a written appeal as provided above, set the matter for hearing. The hearing must be set not later than ten days from the date of the filing of the written appeal. The court shall provide written notice of the date and time of the disposition hearing to: 
(1)  The owner of the animal; 
(2)  The animal control authority; and 
(3)  The city attorney's office. 
The written determination of the animal control authority that the animal is a dangerous animal shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the animal is a dangerous animal. Any interested person may present competent evidence to the court to rebut the presumption of the animal's status. The municipal court shall render its decision in writing within ten days of the date of the hearing. Copies of the decision shall be forwarded to the owner and to the city attorney's office. In the event the decision of the municipal court affirms the animal control's authority that the animal is a dangerous animal, the owner shall be required to comply with the registration requirements set forth below and the animal shall remain impounded pending the owner's compliance with those registration requirements.

(1)  Register the animal with the animal control authority and obtain from the animal control authority a tag supplied by the animal control authority clearly identifying the animal as a "dangerous animal"; 
(2)  Ensure that the identification tag is placed on and worn on the animal at all times; 
(3)  Provide to the animal control authority documentation confirming that the animal has been fitted with a microchip identification device registered with the microchip company and fitted by a licensed veterinarian or, alternatively, reimburse the city for the costs of the microchip device fitted by the animal control authority;

(6)  Permit inspection of the owner's premises where the animal is proposed to be kept for the purpose of ensuring that a secure enclosure, as defined herein, is provided for the animal. 
(b)  The registration required by this subsection is specific and valid as to only the animal made the subject of the registration and the owner identified in the registration certificate. A registration certificate issued pursuant to this section may not be transferred, sold or otherwise conveyed to another person. 
(c)  The registration required by this subsection shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of its issuance and the owner shall be required to reregister the dangerous animal at the expiration of its registration period. Reregistration of a dangerous animal shall require compliance with each of the above provisions. In the event an owner fails to timely reregister an animal finally determined to be a dangerous animal subject to registration, the animal control authority shall be authorized, without hearing or warrant, to immediately seize the animal; notify the owner of the seizure; and impound the animal until such time as the owner properly reregisters the animal. In the event the owner fails to properly reregister a dangerous animal impounded pursuant to this provision within 15 days of its impoundment, the animal control authority shall be authorized to humanely euthanize the animal. 
(d)  An animal finally determined, by notice of the animal control authority or by the municipal court, to be a dangerous animal shall not be released from impoundment until each of the requirements of subsection (a)(1)-(5) has been met by the owner and all fees and costs incurred in connection with the care, impoundment and other required procedures for the animal have been paid to the city. A finding by the animal control authority that an owner of a dangerous animal is no longer in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall constitute grounds for revocation of the animal's registration and seizure and impoundment of the animal as provided in subsection (b). In the event the owner of an animal finally determined to be a dangerous animal fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) (1)-(5) within 30 days of the final written determination, the animal control authority shall be authorized to humanely euthanize the animal.

If the new owner resides within the city or if the dangerous animal is kept or maintained in the city by the new owner, regardless of the new owner's residence, the animal control authority shall notify the new owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by regular mail that the new owner is required to comply with the requirements of this section. Failure of the new owner to properly register the animal with the animal control authority within 15 days of the issuance of such notice to the new owner shall authorize the animal control authority to seize and impound the animal until such time as the new owner complies with the requirements of this section. In the event the new owner fails to properly register the impounded animal within 15 days of its impoundment pursuant to this provision, the animal control authority shall be authorized to humanely euthanize the animal.

No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged into the POTW any wastewater or other wastes containing free or emulsified oil and grease, or combinations thereof, if in the opinion of the Control Authority it appears probable that such wastes: 
(A)  Will deposit free or emulsified fats, grease or oil in the sewer lines in such a manner as to restrict the flow of the sewer; or 
(B)  Will overload skimming and grease-handling; or 
(C)  Will not be amenable to bacterial action and will therefore pass to the receiving water without being affected by normal sewage treatment processes; or 
(D)  Will have deleterious effect on the treatment process due to the excessive quantities. 
(2)  Explosive mixtures. Liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the system including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flash point of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Centigrade utilizing the test methods specified in, 40 CFR 261.21 as amended are prohibited.

Each permittee shall be notified at least 60 days in advance of the change. 
(12)  Temperature. Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the POTW exceeds 40 degrees centigrade (104 F) unless the approval authority upon request of the POTW, approves alternate temperature limits. 
(13)  Any pollutants, including BOD and SS released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the POTW. 
(14)  Use of enzymes, agents or devices. The use of enzymes, chemicals, bacterial or other agents or devices for the purpose of causing oil, grease or solids to pass through the collection system is prohibited unless otherwise authorized by the Control Authority prior to such use. 
(15)  Hauled wastes. Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW 
(c)  Right of revision. National categorical pretreatment standards promulgated by the EPA pursuant to the Act shall be met by dischargers of the regulated industrial categories. An application for modification of the national categorical pretreatment standards may be considered for submittal to the regional administrator by the Director, when the City's wastewater treatment achieves consistent removal of the pollutants as defined by 40 CFR 403.7. The City reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements and discharges to the POTW or to add any applicable government standard where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in this chapter. 
(d)  Special agreements. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any user of the POTW whereby wastewater of unusual strength or character is accepted into the system and specially treated, subject to any payments or user charges as may be applicable, excluding any federal or state standards. 
(e)  General prohibitions. 
(1)  No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, any storm water, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, downspouts, yard drains, yard fountains, ponds, or lawn sprays into the POTW.

(2)  No wastewater may be discharged into any storm sewer within the City; or 
(3)  No wastewater may be discharged into any waters of the state within the City, unless expressly authorized by the approval authority. 
(Ord. No. 490-2010-27, 8-24-10) 
Sec. 8-3C-5. - Control of prohibited wastes. 
    If the Control Authority determines that any person is discharging, or causing to be discharged, to the POTW any wastewater, or other substance in violation of the prohibitions in section 8-3C-4 of this chapter, the Control Authority may take enforcement action pursuant to section 8-3C-11 of this chapter. 
(a)  Compliance with standards: 
(1)  Federal standard. Upon the promulgation of the categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. 
(2)  Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by all dischargers which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this or any other applicable ordinance. 
(3)  Local limits. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge or cause or permit to be discharged, wastewater containing in excess of the following discharge limits. 
(A)  Metals in the form of compounds or elements with total concentrations exceeding the following: 
Pollutant Discharge Limit (mg/L) Arsenic 5.0 Cadmium 2.41 Chromium 4.0 Copper 4.0 Cyanide 3.24 Lead 1.35 Mercury 0.000 1 Nickel 4.0 Silver 4.0 Zinc 4.0  
1  Compliance for mercury will be determined at the minimum analytical level (MAL) of 0.2 g/L. 
(B)  These limits represent a maximum daily discharge for constituents in the form of compounds or elements, in solution or suspension. These limits are based upon a method of allocating pollutant loadings which has been approved by the EPA and incorporated into the City's approved pretreatment program. No discharge into the City's POTW may contain concentrations greater than these limits. These limits apply at a point where the industrial user's waste enters the city sewer. Unless otherwise specified by the Control Authority, compliance with these limits will be assessed by the collection and analysis of a 24-hour composite sample of the wastewater discharge. 
(C)  Permit compliance/non-compliance determinations will be based on the minimum analytical level (MAL) for toxic organic and inorganic parameters. Where permit limits are > MAL, compliance is assessed at the permit limit. Where permit limits are < MAL, effluent concentrations measured as less than the MAL are deemed to be compliant with the permit limitations. When an analysis of an effluent sample results in a measurement of less than the MAL, that parameter shall be reported as "<(MAL Value)" and this shall be interpreted as a value of zero for compliance purposes. For reference: 
Mercury MAL = 0.0002 mg/L (0.2 ppb). 
The Mercury MAL shown will apply irrespective of the mercury method used. 
(D)  All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The Control Authority may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above. 
(E)  The concentration limits as contained in this subsection may be changed upon approval of the Control Authority and with the notification to all applicable users. Notification may be accomplished by publication if so required by state, federal or other applicable agency rules, regulation and orders, including but not limited to the Texas Water Commission Board Rule No. 70-0828-5 regulating the discharge of hazardous metals into or adjacent to state waters. Notwithstanding the provision of requirement of notification by the Control Authority, it is the user's responsibility to monitor all state and federal regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the discharge of wastewaters by any user of the POTW. 
(4)  Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the pretreatment requirements set forth in this chapter. 
(5)  Mass limitations. The Control Authority may impose mass limitations on dischargers where the imposition of mass limitations is deemed appropriate. 
(6)  Submission of plans. Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater flows prior to discharge into any part of the POTW is required, plans, specifications and other pertinent data or information relating to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall first be submitted to the Director for review and approval. Such approval shall not exempt the discharger or such facilities from compliance with any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any subsequent alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to and prior approval of the Director. 
(7)  Pretreatment facilities operations. If pretreatment or control of waste flow is required, such facilities shall be maintained in good working order and operated as efficiently as possible by the owner or operator at their own cost and expense, subject to the requirements of these rules and regulations and all other applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. With prior notice to the Control Authority, an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is also essential for maintenance to assure efficient operation. 
(8)  Admission to property. Whenever it shall be necessary for the purposes of these rules and regulations, the Control Authority, upon the presentation of credentials, may enter upon any property or premises at reasonable times for the purpose of: 
(A)  Copying any records required to be kept under the revisions of this chapter; 
(B)  Inspecting any monitoring equipment or method; and 
(C)  Sampling any discharge of wastewater to the treatment works. The Control Authority may enter upon the property at any hour under emergency circumstances. 
(b)  Accidental discharges: 
(1)  Prevention of accidental discharges. Each discharger shall provide prudent protection to avoid accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Ordinance. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's cost and expense. When applicable, detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Control Authority for review, and shall be approved by the Control Authority before construction of the facility. Each existing discharger as designated by the Control Authority shall complete its plan and submit same to the Control Authority within 60 days after the effective date of this Chapter. No designated discharger proposing to connect or contribute any wastewater to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the Control Authority. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the Control Authority shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this Chapter. 
(2)  Notice of accidental discharges or slugloads: 
(A)  Dischargers shall notify the Control Authority orally as soon as they become aware of the slugload or accidental discharge but not later than 24 hours following the occurrence of a slugload or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by the Chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective action. 
(B)  A written report shall also be provided within five days of the occurrence. The written report shall contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, and if the noncompliance has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance. 
(C)  Notification shall not relieve the discharger of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the discharger of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this section or other applicable law. 
(3)  Liability due to accidental discharges or "slugloads". Any discharger who discharges "slugloads" or prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW caused thereby, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the Control Authority on account thereof under State and Federal law. 
(4)  Instructions to employees. Each employer shall instruct all applicable employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures including the proper telephone number and/or extension number of the Control Authority to be notified. 
(c)  Regulatory actions. If wastewaters containing any substance described in section 8-3C-4 of this chapter are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer system of the City or to any sewer system tributary thereto, the Control Authority and City attorney may take any action necessary to: 
(1)  Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater; 
(2)  Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications will reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with this chapter; 
(3)  Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics or substances so that the discharge will not violate these rules and regulations; 
(4)  Require the discharger making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay any additional cost or expense incurred by the City for handling and treating excess loads imposed on the treatment system as well as damage to the POTW and any fines imposed by the Control Authority; and 
(5)  Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or necessary to achieve the purpose of this chapter.

(5)  Failure to pay penalties imposed pursuant to section 8-3C-12 of this chapter; 
(6)  Failure to pay sewer charges; or 
(7)  Failure to meet compliance schedules. 
(h)  Permit reissuance. The discharger shall apply for permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application a minimum of 30 days prior to the expiration of the discharger's existing permit. Unless otherwise notified by the Control Authority, the renewal application need only contain information that has changed since the last application was filed and be signed by a principal executive officer of the discharger. 
(i)  Petition for relief from permitting requirement. Any discharger under a permit issued pursuant to this section may petition the Control Authority to find that: 
(1)  The discharger no longer meets any of the criteria to be a "significant industrial user" as defined in section 8-3C-1 of this chapter; 
(2)  The discharger has not met any of those criteria for the immediately preceding three years; or 
(3)  The discharger can prove that there is no reasonable cause to continue monitoring the outfall. The petitioning discharger shall bear the burden of proof relevant to the requested findings. 
    The Control Authority shall afford reasonable opportunity for a hearing on any relevant factual issues upon request of the petitioning discharger. 
    If the Control Authority finds that the discharger does not meet any of the criteria to be a SIU as defined in section 8-3C-1 of this chapter and that the discharger has not met any of those criteria for the immediately preceding three years, or that there is no longer any need to monitor the discharge, the Control Authority shall cancel any existing permit issued to the discharger, and the discharger shall be relieved of any further obligation to comply therewith. No such permit cancellation shall affect any later determination that a discharger subsequently meets the criteria for a SIU. 
(j)  Liquid waste hauler permits: 
(1)  No person shall introduce into the POTW any substance which is drained, flushed, or cleaned out any tanks or basins containing chemical liquid wastes, septic tank wastes, oil and grease trap wastes, or any other type of domestic or nondomestic liquid wastes within the City unless such person is issued a permit by the Control Authority, authorizing acts or services. 
(2)  No such liquid waste hauler shall discharge of wastewater or any other waste into the POTW in violation of the standards, limitation, and/or other requirements specified in this chapter. 
(3)  Any disposal site within the City, and any method of disposal, must be approved by the Control authority. Copies of trip tickets shall be maintained and made available inspection at any reasonable time.

(k)  Extra jurisdictional users: 
(1)  Any SIU or MICU located beyond the corporate limits of the City and discharging wastewater into the City's sewer system shall submit a wastewater discharge permit application in accordance with Section 8-3C-6(a)(1)(2) and obtain a permit. Such application shall be submitted to the Control Authority 90 days prior to any proposed discharge into the POTW. 
(2)  Subsection (k)(1) shall not apply to users in neighboring jurisdictions which have an agreement with the City for access to the POTW requiring such jurisdiction to implement and enforce pretreatment program requirements. The City may enter into an agreement with the neighboring jurisdiction in which a SIU is located to provide for the implementation and enforcement of pretreatment program requirements against said user. 
(Ord. No. 490-2010-27, 8-24-10) 
Sec. 8-3C-7. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  General provisions. Each SIU shall provide and operate at their own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the City. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger's premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the discharger, the Control Authority may allow with the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area provided that the facility is situated so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger. All monitoring facilities shall have the prior approval of the Control Authority and shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of permit by discharger. 
(b)  Inspections and sampling: 
(1)  The Control Authority may inspect the facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The discharger shall allow the Control Authority or its representatives to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable times, for the purposes of inspection, sampling, or examination of records. Any employee, agent, or other representative of the Control Authority who enters shall observe the establishment's rules and regulations concerning safety, internal security, and fire protection, and if the property has management in residence, shall notify management or person then in charge of their presence and shall exhibit proper credentials. The Control Authority shall have the right to set up on the discharger's property such devices as are reasonably necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, metering and/or measuring operations. 
(2)  Any discharges of wastewater or other waste into the POTW shall be subject to inspection and/or sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by the Control Authority but at a minimum frequency of once per Pretreatment year. Samples shall be collected in such manner as to be representative of the character and concentration of the wastewater or waste under operating conditions. If requested, the Control Authority shall provide the discharger with a split set of all discharge samples taken. The laboratory methods used in the examination of said waste shall be standard methods and/or those set forth in 40 CFR Part 136. Regular inspections and/or sampling shall be conducted at such times and on such schedules as may be established by the Control Authority. Should a discharger desire that a scheduled inspection and/or sampling be conducted at some time other than that scheduled by the Control Authority, such inspection and/or sampling may be conducted by the Control Authority at the expense of the discharger. 
(3)  Unscheduled inspections may be conducted whenever deemed necessary by the Control Authority to ensure that the terms of this chapter are complied with. 
(4)  The failure or refusal of a discharger to allow the access required by this section shall be grounds for the disconnection of water and/or sewer service to the discharger's facility, pursuant to the applicable provisions of this chapter. If the Control Authority has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Control Authority may seek issuance of a search warrant from the appropriate court. 
(c)  Determination of flow: 
(1)  The water consumption, as determined from the meter records of the City, shall be the basis for computing the sewage flow from any discharger, unless actual sewage flow is measured by a recording meter of a type approved by the Control Authority. If applicable, the discharger shall install and maintain such recording meter in proper condition so as to accurately measure such flow. Upon failure to do so, the water consumption shall be the basis for computing the sewage flow. 
(2)  When water is contained in a product or is evaporated or is discharged as unpolluted wastewater in an uncontaminated condition to surface drainage (in compliance with this chapter and all state and federal laws), an application may be requested for a reduction in the computed volume of waste discharged to the POTW, provided supporting data satisfactory to the Control Authority is furnished. Such data shall include a flow diagram and other indication of the destination of water supply and/or wastewater, supported by data from meters installed on such process piping at the expense of the discharger. 
(3)  Any discharger who procures any part or all of his water supply from a source or sources other than the City, any of which is discharged into the POTW, shall install and maintain at his expense an effluent meter and/or other flow measuring device of a type approved by the Control Authority for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing sewer flow. Such meters or measuring devices shall be read monthly. 
(Ord. No. 490-2010-27, 8-24-10) 
Sec. 8-3C-8. - Reporting requirements for significant dischargers/permittees. 
(a)  Baseline report. Within 180 days following the effective date for any applicable categorical pretreatment standard or 90 days prior to commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new SIU, any SIU subject to a categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the Control Authority a report, indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report from existing SIUs shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, what additional operations and maintenance (O&M) and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards and pretreatment requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger, and certified by a qualified professional. 
(b)  Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by a SIU with an applicable categorical pretreatment standard or 90 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new SIU, any SIU subject to a categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the Control Authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger, and certified to by a qualified professional. 
(c)  Periodic compliance reports. Any SIU subject to a categorical pretreatment standard or requested by the Control Authority shall submit to the Control Authority, during the months of July and January of each year, for the preceding six-month period, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited and regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards or requirements. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow specified in the discharger's permit. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, as determined by the Control Authority may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The Control Authority, taking into consideration such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of said reports on months other than those specified above. 
(d)  Significant industrial discharges reports. Reports from SIU shall contain all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow rate, the nature and concentration of the constituents, or the production and mass of the constituents, where required by the Control Authority. The frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the applicable categorical pretreatment standard or in this chapter, or more frequently as specified by the Control Authority. Sampling shall be done in accordance with standard methods and 40 CFR Part 136. 
(e)  Applicability of reports. The reporting requirements specified in this section as applicable to SIU who are subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall also apply to any other significant industrial discharger upon who the Control Authority imposes such reporting requirements. 
(Ord. No. 490-2010-27, 8-24-10) 
Sec. 8-3C-9. - Confidential information. 
(a)  Submission of confidential information. All information and data submitted by a discharger to the Control Authority may be submitted to the environmental protection agency pursuant to the Clean Water Act and the regulations promulgated by the EPA governing the POTW. Such information shall be considered subject to public disclosure, provided, however, that the discharger may request that information not be subject to public disclosure, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 2, as follows: 
(1)  A discharger may assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information, in a manner described below, and that information covered by such a claim will be disclosed only by means of the procedure set forth below; or 
(2)  If no claim of business confidentiality is asserted, all information will be subject to public disclosure without further notice to the discharger. 
(b)  Method and time of asserting business confidentiality claim. A discharger which is submitting information to the Control Authority may assert a business confidentiality claim covering the information by placing on (or attaching to) the information, at the time it is submitted to the Control Authority, a cover sheet, stamped or typed legend, or other suitable form of notice employing language such as "trade secret", "proprietary", or "company confidential". Allegedly confidential portions of otherwise nonconfidential documents should be clearly identified by the discharger, and may be submitted separately to facilitate identification and handling by the Control Authority. If the discharger desires confidential treatment only until a certain date or until the occurrence of a certain event, the notice should so state. 
(c)  Effluent disclosure. Nothing in this section shall prevent the disclosure of information and data regarding the nature and content of a discharger's effluent, the frequency of discharge, or a standard or limitation to be met by discharger, and this information shall be available to the public with no restrictions. 
(Ord. No. 490-2010-27, 8-24-10) 
Sec. 8-3C-10. - Industrial/commercial wastewater surcharge. 
(a)  Excessive strength discharge. Persons discharging wastes or wastewaters which exhibit none of the characteristics of wastes prohibited in section 8-3C-4 of this chapter except that BOD, COD, or suspended solids, concentrations are greater than that of "normal domestic sewage" as defined in section 8-3C-1 of this chapter may be required to pretreat the industrial wastes to meet the requirements of "normal domestic sewage"; however, such wastes may be accepted for treatment if all the following requirements are met: 
(1)  The wastes will not cause damage to the collection system; 
(2)  The wastes will not cause interference to the treatment process; and 
(3)  CIU, SIU and MIU sewer users shall enter into a permit agreement with the City for a surcharge over and above published sewer rates. 
(A)  Surcharge formula. The basis for surcharge on industrial waste shall be determined by the following formula: 
WS = (8.34 x 10 -6 ) (v) [(TCB)(B-200) + (TCS)(S-220)] where 
WS = Waste surcharge to user in dollars to be added to monthly billing for sewer 
TCB = Treatment Cost for BOD 
B = BOD Strength Index in mg/l 
200 = Normal BOD Strength in mg/l 
TCS = Treatment Cost for TSS 
S = Suspended Solids Strength Index in mg/l 
220 = Normal Suspended Solids Strength in mg/l 
8.34  10 -6 = Factor Converting mg/l to pounds/gallons 
In certain cases COD will be substituted for BOD in which case the terms shall be changed as follows: 
WS = (8.34 x 10 -6 ) (v) [(TCC)(C-800) + (TCS)(C-220)] where: 
TCC = Treatment Cost for COD 
C = Chemical Oxygen Demand in mg/l 
800 = Normal COD strength in mg/l 
(B)  Surcharge billing. Industrial waste surcharges provided for in this chapter shall be included with the regular bill for water and sewer charges and shall be paid monthly. Surcharges shall be paid concurrent with other applicable utility charges of the persons become due. Payment for utility charges shall not be accepted without payment also of surcharges. 
(Ord. No. 490-2010-27, 8-24-10) 
Sec. 8-3C-11. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Revocation of permit. In accordance with the procedures in this section, the Control Authority may revoke the permit of any discharger which: 
(1)  Fails to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(2)  Fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or characteristics; 
(3)  Refuses to allow reasonable and timely access to the discharger's premises by representatives of the Control Authority for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; 
(4)  Fails to fulfill the conditions of its permit; 
(5)  Fails to meet pretreatment requirements; 
(6)  Fails to pay penalties imposed pursuant to section 8-3C-12 of this chapter; 
(7)  Fails to pay bills for sewer services; or 
(8)  Fails to meet compliance schedules. 
(b)  Notification of violation. Whenever the Control Authority finds that any discharger has violated or is violating this chapter or its discharge permit, the Control Authority may serve or cause to be served upon such discharger a written notice, either by personal delivery or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, the discharger shall respond in person or in writing to the Control Authority, stating its position with respect to the notice of violation. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to discuss the occurrence of the violation or alleged violations and, where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. Where any violation of permit or ordinance is not corrected by means of administrative adjustment as described in subsection (b) of this section, the Control Authority may order any violating discharger to show cause, before the Control Authority or its duly authorized representative, why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Control Authority or its designee regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the discharger to show cause before the authority or its designee why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served not less than ten days prior to the scheduled hearing. Service shall be made on any agent, officer, or authorized representative of the discharger. The Director or the Control Authority may themselves conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any employee of the City or any specially appointed attorney or engineer to: 
(1)  Issue in the name of the City notices of hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearing; 
(2)  Take the evidence; and 
(3)  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the Control Authority for action thereon. 
    At any hearing held pursuant to this section, testimony taken shall be under oath and a record made thereof. Any party is entitled to present the case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination. A copy of any final report shall be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
(d)  Action following show cause hearing. After the control authority has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the discharger responsible for any violation found to have been committed, directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed or existing treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued, including revocation or suspension of any discharge permit. 
(e)  Right to appeal. Following the entry of the order by the Control Authority with respect to the conduct of a discharger, the discharger may file an appeal in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction challenging the Control Authority's order. 
(f)  Emergency suspension of service and/or discharge permit. The Control Authority may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the sole opinion of the Control Authority, to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW, or causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES/TPDES permit. Also, the Control Authority may suspend wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit whenever acids and chemicals damaging the sewer lines or treatment processes are released to the sewer causing rapid deterioration of such structures or interfering with proper treatment of sewage. 
    Any discharger notified of an emergency suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or its wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the offending discharge. In the event of a failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Control Authority shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate disconnection of the discharger's sewer and/or water service connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals or the environment. 
    In the case of emergency disconnection of service, the Control Authority shall make reasonable attempts to notify the discharger or user of the premises where such offending discharge is generated before disconnecting the water or sewer service line. The party whose service has been disconnected shall have an opportunity for a hearing before the Control Authority on the issue of the offending discharge and the disconnection as soon as possible after such disconnection has taken place. 
    The Control Authority may reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment and/or water service upon proof of the elimination of the offending discharge. A detailed written statement by the discharger describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Control Authority within fifteen 15 days of the date of the occurrence. The City water and/or wastewater service shall be reconnected only at the discharger's expense. 
(g)  Legal action. Any discharge in violation of the substantive provisions of this chapter or an order of the City Council shall be considered a public nuisance. If any person discharges wastewater or other wastes into the City's POTW contrary to the provisions of this chapter, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the City, the City attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(h)  Protection from damage. No unauthorized person shall maliciously or willfully break, damage, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the municipal sewage works, or any action which knowingly endangers the public or City personnel. Any person violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under the charge of disorderly conduct. 
(i)  Recovery of costs incurred by the Control Authority. Any discharger violating any of the provisions of this chapter or causing damage to or impairing the City's wastewater disposal system shall be liable to the City for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The City shall bill the discharger for the costs incurred by the City for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. 
(j)  Act of God provision. 
(1)  An event that would otherwise be a violation that is caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe is not a violation.

These procedures shall include provision for at least annually providing public notification in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality in which the POTW is located, of industrial users which, during the previous 12 months, were determined to be in significant noncompliance, as defined in section 8-3C-1 of this chapter.

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 99-39,  I-IV, adopted Nov. 9, 1999, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, inclusion of said ordinance provisions as  8-13-1-8-13-4 was at the discretion of the editor to read as herein set out. See the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 8-13-1. - General. 
(a)  Title. This chapter shall be known as the "Water and Sanitary Sewer System Extension and Assessment Policy Ordinance" of the city. 
(b)  Statement of purpose. The primary purpose for adoption of this chapter is to set forth the requirements to be followed in extending public water and sanitary sewer lines to serve residential subdivisions or groups of residential customers within the city, where subdivision and development occurred prior to the enactment of other ordinances of city which require the installation of water and sewer services as a condition to subdivision and development. For the purposes of this chapter only, a subdivision shall be deemed to be residential in character if 60 percent or more of the customers in the subdivision are residential customers, and groups of customers shall be deemed to be residential in character if 60 percent or more of the customers in the group are residential customers. The city, in the discretion of the utility board and the city council, may choose to apply this chapter in extending public water and/or sanitary sewer lines to serve commercial subdivisions or groups of residential and commercial customers within the city where subdivision and development occurred prior to the enactment of other ordinances of the city which require the installation of water and sewer services as a condition to subdivision and development. The requirements under this chapter are in addition to and specifically exclude provisions and requirements for extension and installation of water and sewer lines in residential subdivisions or commercial development which are covered in the city subdivision ordinance and any applicable provisions of the building code. The city council and utility board reserve the right to refuse to extend water or sanitary sewer system improvements in situations where off-site mains, laterals, extensions, appliances, adjuncts or appurtenances are required to connect the improvements to the existing city water or sewer system which are not assessable under the provisions of the assessment statute. 
(c)  Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following words, terms and phrases and their derivations shall have the following meanings: 
    Assessment statute means V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 402, subch. D (V.T.C.A., Local Government Code  402.061 et seq.). 
    Benefitted property, means a lot or tract to which water or sewer service is made available under this chapter. 
    City means City of Weatherford, Texas. 
    Cost of improvement includes construction expense, engineering expenses, fiscal fees, and other expenses incidental to the construction of improvements to the water system, sewer system, or both systems in addition to the other costs of the improvements including acquisition of right-of-way or easements. 
    Customer means the owner of a lot, tract or parcel of real property who purchases water or sewer services from the city. 
    Lien means the right to take and sell or hold the property of a debtor as security or payment for a debt. 
    Owner means a person having legal title to the lot, tract or parcel of real property in question. If a particular lot, tract or parcel of real property is owned by more than one co-owners, the owner of such tract for purposes of this chapter shall be all of the owners of undivided interest in the real estate. 
    Potential customer means the owner of a lot, tract or parcel of real property who desires to purchase water or sewer services from the city if the requested extension of water or sewer service is granted. 
    Sewer system improvements means the laying of mains, laterals, and extensions and all appliances and necessary adjuncts required for the sanitary disposal of sewage from the area in which the improvements are made but does not include off-site mains, laterals, and extensions and appliances and adjuncts necessary to connect the improvements to the existing sewer system operated by the municipality.

    Any of the terms which are defined in this section shall also bear any meaning ascribed thereto in the annexation statute. 
Sec. 8-13-2. - Project determination. 
(a)  Improvements requested by customer(s). One potential customer or a group of single potential customers may request public water or sanitary sewer lines be extended to serve the property owned by such petitioning potential customers. Any such request must be made in writing and addressed to the director of utilities, and shall state that the petitioner acknowledges that if the extension is made by the city, the benefitted properties will be assessed a portion of the costs of the extension. If a particular benefitted property is owned by more than one co-owner, the number of co-owners necessary to make the request shall be such proportion of such owners of undivided interest as the city may determine, in its reasonable discretion, necessary to act on behalf of all such co-owners. In order for any request to be effective, at least 65 percent of the owners of benefitted properties must submit such a request to the city. Any request by a potential customer expires, and cannot be considered in computing a percentage of requests by owners of benefitted property, 90 days after it is submitted to the director of utilities, unless the required percentage of other requesting owners is received by the director of utilities prior to such expiration date. The percentage will be based on the number of properties which request the extension, compared to the total number of all of the benefitted properties in the area to be served by the request. The director of utilities shall determine the area to be served by the request, which shall be limited to the potential customers who could be connected to the extension from the point of connection of extension to the existing city system to the end of the extension. The end of the extension is the logical termination point, as determined by the director of utilities, beyond the last requesting potential customer. Unless the topography or other engineering conditions dictate otherwise, the end of the extension will be the end of the block or street, which contains potential customers, involved in the request. The area to be served by the request may include an entire subdivision if more than 65 percent of the lots in the subdivision are involved in the request. 
    The letter of request should also include the following items for each potential customer. 
(1)  Name 
(2)  Address 
(3)  Telephone number 
(4)  Lot, block, and addition or on unplatted property, a tract designation per local tax maps, survey name, and abstract number 
(5)  Type and size of service requested 
(6)  Preference of service location as measured from property corner along frontage 
    Upon receipt of requests, the director of utilities will review the request. The utilities department will prepare an estimate of cost for the water and/or the sanitary sewer line extensions. The estimate shall include construction costs and an allowance of 25 percent of the construction cost estimate for engineering, administrative, field survey, and contingency costs. A plan layout of the requested improvements shall accompany the estimate and a list of the benefitted properties for per lot or per service. The estimate and accompanying material shall be returned to the director of utilities for presentation to the utility board. Depending on availability of funds, the utility board will authorize or not authorize the city staff to proceed with the detail construction plans and assessment policy requirements. 
(b)  Improvements proposed by city staff. The city staff can initiate projects to extend public water/or sewer system improvements under the provisions of this chapter when the improvements will provide service to benefitted property and the improvements will enhance the public health and general welfare. In such event, the procedure for estimates of costs, plan layout and presentation to the utility board will be followed. 
Sec. 8-13-3. - Assessment policy. 
(a)  Percentage to be assessed benefitted property. The city council will assess up to nine-tenths of the estimated cost of improvements against the benefitted property and the owners of that property. Where an extension is requested pursuant to section 8-13-2(a). above, the city council will assess 65 percent of the estimated cost of the improvements against the benefitted property and the owners of that property. 
    Any portion of the improvements which are to be included in "impact fee" calculations as providing for future development will not be included in the assessments against the benefitted property, except to the extent determined by the city council to be necessary for fairness and substantial equity in administering the utility system and the impact fee ordinances of the city. 
(b)  Apportionment of assessments. The city shall separately compute the cost of the water or sewer improvements and shall apportion the part of the cost of those improvements that may be assessed against the benefitted property and the owners of the property, among the parcels of the benefitted property and the owners for per lot or per service connection assessment. In determining the service connection assessment for each lot or service connection, the city may assign a higher assessment to connections or potential connections for commercial or other customers which will require larger service line and higher volume service demands. 
    The city has determined that, particularly with respect to residential customers having varied frontages and lot sizes, but similar demands on the respective water or sewer system, the front foot rule would result in injustice or inequality. However, if the peculiar circumstances of any particular improvement indicate that justice or equality would better be suited with the front foot rule, the city may elect in such cases to use the front foot rule. In such cases the city shall assess each parcel of benefitted property according to the number of lineal feet of the parcel that abuts on a public street, irrespective of the location of improvements constructed under this chapter relating to that parcel if the improvements provide water or sewer service to the assessed parcel. The city council shall assess a corner lot based on the shorter side of the lot that abuts on a public street. In the event the city assesses costs on a basis other than the front foot rule, the city council shall adjust the apportionment of costs so as to produce a substantial equality of benefits received and burdens imposed. 
    Any assessments levied pursuant to this chapter will relate to the specific improvements made under the extension of services, and such assessments in one district or unit or service area are no wise related to, or connected with the improvements and assessments in any other unit, district or service area, and, in order to make the specific assessments under this chapter, the amount so assessed for improvements will not in any wise be affected by any fact, assessment, cost or other way connected with the improvements or assessments in any other unit, district or service area. 
(c)  Procedure of assessment. The procedure for legally assessing the benefitted properties and owners shall be as set forth in the assessment statute. Any subsequent revision to the assessment statute will be adhered to from its effective date forward. 
(d)  Liens. 
(1)  Notice of improvements. If the city levies or assesses any of the cost of improvements against the benefitted property, the city will file a notice, signed on behalf of the city by the mayor, with the county clerk of each county in which the assessed property is located. The notice will substantially show that the city has determined by ordinance, resolution, order, directive, or otherwise that water or sewer system improvements are necessary, identify the required improvements by location or otherwise, state that a portion of the cost of the improvements is to be or has been specifically assessed against the benefitted property. One notice may contain any number of systems or improvements. 
It is not necessary that a notice under this section gives details or be sworn to or acknowledged. The city may file the notice at any time. The county clerk with whom the notice is filed shall record the notice in the records of mortgages or deeds of trust and shall index it in the name of the city and in the name or other designation of the water or sewer system to which the notice relates. 
(2)  Amount and interest rate. An assessment against benefitted property under this chapter shall be a lien collectable with interest, cost of collection, and reasonable attorney's fees. The assessment is a first and prior lien on the assessed property and the lien takes effect on the date that a notice of proposed improvements is made as stated in the preceding subsection (d)(1). The lien is superior to any other lien or claim except a state, county, school district, or municipal property tax lien. The assessment is a personal liability and charge against the owners of the assessed property of the date on which the lien takes effect, whether or not the owners are named in a notice, instrument, certificate, or ordinance. The city may make assessments against several parcels of benefitted property in one assessment if the parcels are owned by the same person. The city may jointly assess benefitted property owned jointly by one or more persons. 
When the ordinance is adopted levying the assessment of the costs for improvements against benefitted property, the city council shall prescribe an interest rate to be applied on the assessments not to exceed ten percent a year the "maximum rate". The interest rate shall be not less than the "prime rate" then most currently published the Wall Street Journal plus one percent per annum, not to exceed the maximum rate. In the event the prime rate is not published or not available in the Wall Street Journal, the interest rate shall not be less than the average prime or base rate of interest charged by the three largest banking institutions in Dallas County, Texas which are in place and in effect at the time of the assessment, plus one percent per annum not to exceed the maximum rate. The interest on the liens shall begin after the public improvements are complete and functional and thirty days after invoices have been mailed to all benefitted property owners. 
(e)  Assessing ordinance. Complying with the requirements of the assessment statute, after the declaration for the need for the improvement, engineer's estimate, notices, hearings and determinations by the city council, the city shall adopt an ordinance ("assessment ordinance") providing for the assessments, establishing the rate of interest and terms of payment in accordance with the provisions of the assessment statute and this chapter. 
Sec. 8-13-4. - Payment procedure. 
(a)  Lump sum. The assessed amount can be paid any time prior to 30 days after the invoices are mailed out without interest costs. After that time, a lump sum payment may be made and the payment will be applied first to any interest accumulation. 
(b)  Five payment payout plan. Upon written request, the city will allow a benefitted property owner to divide his assessment into five equal payments, which include the "remaining balance" interest at the rate prescribed by the city council. The first payment to be made within 60 days of the date the invoice was mailed. The subsequent four payments shall be made annually on the anniversary date of the initial payment. 
(c)  Other pay out plans. The city, in its assessment ordinance, may establish other installment payment plans providing for the payment of the assessment and accrued, unpaid interest on a monthly basis over a period of time not to exceed three years. 
(d)  Non-payment provision. 
(1)  If the assessments are not paid in accordance with the provisions of the assessment ordinance, including any installment provisions provided therein, the city will accumulate interest thereafter at the maximum rate by law. If any installment payment which has become due remains unpaid on an assessment as provided for in the assessment ordinance adopted by the city, the entire remaining amount of the assessment plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon may be declared immediately due and payable by the city. The lien on the property may be foreclosed upon such nonpayment, by action of the governing body of the city directing foreclosure. 
(2)  If a default be made in the payment of any assessment or installment on any assessment, at the sole election and option of the city, the collection thereof may be enforced by any means provided in this chapter, the annexation statute, the assessment ordinance, or by termination of the utility services after notice and other procedures, if any, which are applicable through any other polices and ordinances of the city generally for termination of water or sewer services, as the case may be, on account of nonpayment of any monthly statement for services.

CHAPTER 16. - WATER CONSERVATION AND DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN[9] 
Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), adopted April 9, 2019, repealed the former Title VIII, Chapter 16,  8-16-1-8-16-4, 8-16-11-8-16-23, 8-16-31-8-16-42, and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. The former Chapter 16 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 501-2010-37,  1(Chs. 1-3), adopted Aug. 24, 2010; and Ord. No. 753-2015-42 ,  1, adopted Nov. 17, 2015. 
Editor's note- Appendices A-E, as attached to Ord. No. O2019-12 , are not set out herein at length, but are incorporated by reference. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 8-16-1. - Introduction. 
    This report outlines the city's water conservation and drought contingency programs. The objective of the conservation program is to reduce the quantity required for each water using activity, as is practical, through the implementation of efficient water practices. The drought contingency program provides procedures for voluntary and mandatory actions to be put in place upon the city's water supply system during a water shortage emergency. Drought contingency procedures include a prohibition of certain uses. Both programs are tools that the City will have available to operate effectively in all situations. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-2. - Planning area and project description. 
    The City of Weatherford is located in southeast Parker County. The water and wastewater service area is defined by the city's certificate of convenience and necessity (CCN) boundary. Presently, only a small percentage of the city's water and wastewater customers are located outside the city's corporate limits. The city's current service area is approximately 28.96 square miles, but the potential service area including the CCN and city limits measures approximately 44.3 square miles. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-3. - Utility profile. 
    A detailed summary of utility evaluation data is included in appendix A. This data substantiates the need for implementing a water conservation program along with other improvements. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-4. - Water conservation goals-Five- and ten-year targets. 
    The objective of a water conservation plan is to reduce the per capita consumption of water, a finite resource. Many communities throughout the United States have used conservation measures to successfully cope with various water and wastewater problems. Reductions in water use of as much as 25 percent have been achieved, but the normal range is five percent to 15 percent. The goals established in the previous plan included a five percent reduction in the first five years, and an additional two and one-half percent reduction in the next five years. Annual water consumption for both total retail usage and residential usage is shown in the following graph. To average out weather patterns, staff compared five-year averages in lieu of individual year comparisons. The five-year average in 2013 was 160 gallons per capita per day (gpcd) for total retail consumption. By 2018, the five-year average was 136 gpcd, which amounts to a 15 percent reduction over the last five years. It is worth noting that the Texas Water Development Board and the Water Conservation Implementation Task Force recommended a goal of 140 gpcd for retail water consumption. During this same period, the residential use decreased from 79 gpcd to 64 gpcd, which amounts to a 19 percent reduction. 

    It is the goal of this water conservation plan to reduce overall retail per capita water consumption by an additional two and one-half percent within five years of adopting this plan and an additional 2.5% within ten years, for a total of five years. Because of the already low residential per capita usage, the goal is to reduce residential consumption by one percent within the next five years, and an additional one percent within ten years, for a total of two percent. 
    These targets will be achieved by tracking water use, control of water loss, continuing water conservation education programs and literature, and implementation of the reclaimed water program. In an effort to minimize real and apparent water loss in the distribution system, meters are installed at dead end mains during flushing to calculate water loss, all water meters were replaced with more accurate meters as part of the automated metering system program, and fire hydrant locks have been installed where water loss concerns are present. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Secs. 8-16-5-8-16-10. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - WATER CONSERVATION PLAN 

Sec. 8-16-11. - Plan elements. 
    There are many elements to be considered in developing a water conservation plan. The principal water conservation methods to be considered in preparing this water conservation plan are: 
  Universal metering and meter repair/replacement - Accurate metering of water deliveries is an important element in the City of Weatherford's program to control and minimize water loss. 
  Water audits and leak detection - Leak detection in the delivery system allows the City of Weatherford ways to improve or eliminate water lost. Routine audits are a tool to inform the city where conservation efforts may be needed. 
  Unaccounted-for water use - Identifying water loss allows the city to take direct action to maximize the efficiency of our water system. 
  Continuing public education and information - Education and technical assistance programs are important to inform people about the impact of improved water efficiency and water conservation. 
  Non-promotional water rate structure - Rate structure evaluation allows the city to provide services needed to our residents while focusing on water conservation. 
  Water conservation implementation report - This report is required by the TCEQ and lists various water conservation strategies that have been implemented and the date the strategy was implemented. The reporting entity must establish conservation goals and includes accountability measures to track progress of those goals. 
  Record management system - A system that allows the City to monitor water loss in the distribution system. 
  Coordination with regional water planning group - Gives the city the opportunity to identify regional water supply problems and gives opportunities to address local issues and concerns. 
  Implementation and enforcement - Clear implementation and enforcement measures allow the city to ensure an adequate water supply as our population grows. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-12. - Universal metering and meter repair/replacement. 
    All water users including retail, city and other public facilities are metered. All metering devices must be within an accuracy of plus (+) or minus (-) five percent in order to measure and account for the amount of water diverted from the source of supply. Master meters for Raw and finished water are located at the water purification plant. 
    A regular scheduled maintenance program of meter testing, repair, and replacement will be established in accordance with the following schedule: 
(1)  Meters four inches and larger - test once a year. 
(2)  Meters from one and one-half inches to three inches - test two percent every year. 
(3)  Smart meters smaller than one and one-half inches - replace as batteries expire. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-13. - Water audits and leak detection. 
    The city will continue their on-going leak detection, location, and repair programs. Water line leaks are detected by utility personnel while reading meters, maintaining the water and wastewater systems and while performing other routine surveillance programs. Utilizing the new automated meter system program will also allow staff to monitor customer's water usage to potentially identify and notify customers of potential leaks. 
    Additionally, water audits shall be utilized to determine if leaks exist which have gone undetected. The city shall conduct water audits at least once a year to compare water purchased versus water sold. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-14. - Unaccounted-for water use. 
    Measures to control unaccounted water are part of the routine operations of the city. Unaccounted water use is tracked on a monthly basis with the efforts of multiple departments not limited to: the water purification plant, water maintenance crews, and finance. Maintenance crews and personnel consistently monitor and inspect for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system. City personnel watch for and report signs of illegal connections so they can be addressed quickly. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-15. - Continuing public education and information. 
    The city recognizes that water conservation significantly benefits individuals and communities in terms of long-term program availability and costs. The most readily available and lowest cost method of promoting water conservation is to inform the retail water users about ways to save water in homes and businesses, in landscaping and lawn uses, and in recreational uses. The city will provide the information to retail customers in the following manner: 
(1)  Distribution of educational material in the form of a mail-out or information added to the water bill. 
(2)  Provide information on the City of Weatherford website on water conservation. Information to include; currently adopted water conservation and drought contingency plan, conservation tips, adopted watering schedule for water customers, etc. 
(3)  Host a booth at various City of Weatherford/Weatherford Chamber of Commerce special events throughout the year (Weatherford Blooms Festival, Parker County Peach Festival, W.I.S.D. Third Grade Tours). Promote water conservation to customers by providing literature/brochures/handouts and giving away free items; moisture meters, rain/sprinkler gauges, hose timers, low flow shower heads, etc. 
(4)  Provide educational materials made available from Take Care of Texas on the City of Weatherford website and Water Utilities Facebook page. 
(5)  Promote WaterIsAwesome to customers for them to sign up to receive text and email reminders with suggestions on what their lawn needs every week. In addition, work on promoting other educational materials that are available through the website at various times throughout the year. 
(6)  Create a brochure that will include water conservation literature for new customers when applying for service. 
    The development and neighborhood services department adopted the provisions of HB 1656 as part of the irrigation system application. The bill requires cities with populations greater than 20,000 to require plan submittal of new irrigation systems, installation inspection, and a final walk-through. See appendix B. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-16. - Non-promotional water rate structure. 
    The city will periodically review respective retail water rate structures to ensure that the prevailing rates encourage water conservation while covering the total cost of service and minimizing adverse impacts. The city updated an increasing block rate structure in 2016 to encourage continued water conservation. See appendix C. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-17. - Water conservation implementation report. 
    The TCEQ required Water Conservation Implementation Report is required by rule to be updated and submitted along with the water conservation plan every five years. In addition, this form must be updated when revisions are made to the water conservation plan in between the five-year submittals. This report is an overview of the summary of updates/revisions that have been made to the water conservation plan. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-18. - Reuse of wastewater. 
    The City of Weatherford recognizes that a major goal of water conservation is beneficial reuse of wastewater. There are four plans for beneficial reuse of wastewater at the city: reuse from the wastewater treatment plant to jet/clean wastewater lines; use of effluent from the water treatment plant backwash lagoons for use by the golf course for irrigation purposes; and the beneficial reuse of effluent from the wastewater treatment plant and water treatment plant backwash lagoons to supplement water supply sources in Lake Weatherford by discharging flow to Lake Weatherford. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-19. - Record management system. 
    The city will continue the use of its record management system which tracks water diverted, water produced, transmission, metered and un-metered losses, and water sales as required by Title 30 TAC, Part 1, Chapter 288, Subchapter A, Rule 288.2(a)(2)(B). Water sales are further identified into several categories, including but not limited to: Residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial. This system tracks this information on a monthly basis which allows the city to respond quickly to suspected problems of water loss. Furthermore, the new automated meter system has the ability to track water usage on an hourly basis, helping to identify potential water leaks on a more frequent basis. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-20. - Year-round water conservation measures. 
    The City of Weatherford, in conjunction with other regional DFW cities, has implemented year-round water conservation measures. January 1 through December 31 of each year, the city will limit watering to no more than twice per week according to the odd/even schedule described below. If the city is already under a more restrictive stage of the plan, the higher-level restrictions shall prevail. 
(1)  Prohibit outdoor watering with sprinklers or irrigation systems between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. every day of the year. Watering with hand-held hoses, drip irrigation, and soaker hoses are allowed. 
(2)  Limit landscape watering with sprinklers or irrigation systems is limited to mandatory twice per week based on the last digit of the service address. 
  Residential and commercial addresses ending in an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) may water on Wednesdays and Saturdays. 
  Residential and commercial addresses ending in an odd number (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) may water on Thursdays and Sundays. 
  City, local government, and school district offices may water on Tuesdays and Fridays. 
  Landscape watering will not be permitted on Mondays. 
(Ord. No. O- O2019-12 ,  1(Exh.), 4-9-19) 
Sec. 8-16-21. - Coordination with regional water planning group. 
    The city will continue to maintain an active participation within its regional water planning group. The city has an elected representative, on the Region C planning group, who attends regional planning meetings, workshops, and other events.

(2-11-20) 
Sec. 9-5-3. - Statement to be filed. 
    The contract and bonds (if any), having been approved by the City Council, if any part of the cost of such improvement is to be assessed against owners of abutting property and their property, or owners of street or other railways and their property, it shall be the duty of the engineer or other engineer, as may be determined by the City Council, to prepare and file with the City Council, a statement containing the names of the persons owning property abutting on the proposed improvements, and describing each parcel by lot or block number, number of front feet, or otherwise, so as to sufficiently identify the same. Such statement shall contain an estimate of the total cost of such improvement and of the portion of such total proposed to be assessed against owners of abutting property and against owners of said railroads occupying said highways, and the estimated cost per front foot of abutting property. The City Council shall examine such statement and after correcting any errors therein, approve the same, but no error, mistake or omission shall invalidate the same or any assessment made thereunder. 
    After approving said statement, if it is finally determined to assess a part of the cost of such improvements against property owners and their property, the City Council shall so declare by resolution, ordering a hearing to be given to owners of such abutting property and/or such railroads and other parties interested in any manner, and notice thereof by advertisement inserted not less than three times in some newspaper published in the City, the first publication to be not less than ten days before the date of the hearing therein referred to. Such notice shall be signed by the secretary, or other officer designated by the City Council, and shall, in general terms, set forth the nature and extent of the proposed improvements, the total estimated cost thereof proposed to be assessed against such owners and their property, the amount per front foot of abutting property proposed to be assessed against such owners and their property, and shall also state the time and place designated by the City Council for a hearing of said owners. Said notice need not contain a list of such property owners or specific description of each parcel of property.

Sec. 9-5-4. - Hearing. 
    Said hearing to said property owners and owners of railways and others interested, shall be held before the council at the time and place designated, and at such hearing such owners, their agents or attorneys, and any other person having any interest in property to be assessed, shall receive a full and fair hearing of all matters with reference to said proposed assessment against them and their property, and any irregularity or invalidity in any proceeding with reference thereto, or the special benefits of said improvements to their property in the enhanced value thereof, or any other matter or thing with reference thereto, and such owners or other interested parties, may, at such hearing, appear in person or by attorney, and produce evidence and subpoena witnesses. Said hearing shall continue from day to day and time to time without further notice until all have been fully heard. 
(2-11-20) 
Sec. 9-5-5. - Assessments. 
    After such hearing has been closed, the council shall, from the evidence before it, determine the amounts, if any, to be assessed against each owner and his property, including owners of railways occupying the highway, and shall by ordinance assess the same against the property of each owner, and declare the amount so assessed to be a personal liability of its owner. The total amount to be assessed against such owners of abutting property and their property shall be apportioned among them in accordance with the front foot plan or rule, in proportion as the frontage of each owner is to the whole frontage to be improved; provided, that if the applicant of this rule shall, in the opinion of the council, be unjust or unequal, or result in individual cases in an assessment in excess of special benefits received from such improvement, then the council shall adopt such rule of apportionment which shall effect a substantial equality and uniformity between said owners, considering benefits received by, and burdens imposed upon them and their property. 
    The owners of railways occupying the highway improved and their property, shall be assessed such sums as may be prescribed by law and the City Charter. 
    Assessments made against any property shall be superior to, and bind the interest therein of all persons claiming a lien or other interest therein, except as to state, City or county taxes.

(c)  Selective thinning and removal of underbrush: 
(1)  The landscape administrator may issue a single tree permit allowing the alteration of certain protected trees from a densely forested area when the landscape administrator determines that the selective thinning is being done in a professionally accepted manner that will enhance the environment and the likelihood of survival for the remaining trees. If the landscape administrator issues a permit for selective thinning, the protected trees covered by the permit shall be exempt from the tree replacement and tree protection requirements of sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8 of this chapter. 
(2)  The landscape administrator may issue a permit allowing the clearing and grubbing of brush located within or under the drip lines of protected trees subject to reasonable conditions to insure the maximum protection for the trees.

(d)  Clear-cutting: The landscape administrator may issue a single tree permit allowing the clear-cutting of protected trees from property zoned "A" (agriculture) after the landscape administrator makes an on-site inspection of the property to be cleared and receives a written statement from the applicant describing the purpose and reason for the clear-cutting, but only if the landscape administrator determines that the clear-cutting is for a legitimate, agricultural reason. If the landscape administrator issues such a permit, the protected trees covered by the permit shall be exempt from the tree replacement and tree protection requirements of sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8 of this chapter. If the land ceases to be used for agricultural purposes at any time within three years after the permit is obtained to remove the trees, the owner of the land must comply with the tree replacement requirements contained in section 9-7-7 of this chapter. This requirement runs with the land. 
(e)  Diseased, damaged, or dangerous trees: The landscape administrator may issue a tree permit for any tree that is diseased, infected or damaged beyond the point of recovery, or in danger of falling (except as described by subsection 9-7-3(c)(1) herein) as determined by the landscape administrator prior to the alteration of the tree. A diseased tree may be altered by the City or an individual to reduce the chance of spreading the disease to adjacent healthy trees. If the landscape administrator issues such a permit, the protected trees covered by the permit shall be exempt from the tree replacement and tree protection requirements of sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8 of this chapter.

If the landscape administrator issues such a permit, the protected trees covered by the permit shall be exempt from the tree replacement and tree protection requirements of sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8 of this chapter. (However, protected trees altered in excess of seven per calendar year are not exempt under this section and will require tree permits and must comply with tree replacement and tree protection requirements.) 
(g)  New developments: 
(1)  Residential subdivision: In a residential subdivision, all protected trees that the landscape administrator determines must be altered in order to install utility lines within public rights-of-way or utility easements or drainage easements as shown on approved final plat, or to achieve the cut/fill drainage as designated on the master drainage construction plan, shall be exempt from the tree replacement and tree protection requirements listed in sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8 of this chapter. Any protected trees within these areas that the landscape administrator determines do not have to be altered shall be subject to the tree protection requirements listed in section 9-7-8 of this chapter, but not to the tree replacement requirements listed in section 9-7-7 of this chapter. All other areas of the subdivision shall be subject to both the tree replacement and the tree protection requirements, and all other provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Single lot residential development: In a single lot residential development, all areas within the building pad site, driveways, public sidewalks, patios, septic tank and lateral lines, parking area, and pool and associated deck area shall be exempt from the tree replacement and tree protection requirements of sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8 of this chapter. All other areas of the lot shall be subject to both the tree replacement and the tree protection requirements, and all other provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Non-residential development: In a non-residential development, all protected trees that the landscape administrator determines must be altered in order to install utility lines within public right-of-way or public utility or drainage easements as shown on an approved final plat, or to install fire lanes, required parking areas and building pad sites as shown on an approved site plan, shall be exempt from the tree protection and tree replacement requirements listed in sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8 of this chapter. Any protected trees within these areas that the landscape administrator determines do not have to be altered shall be subject to the tree protection requirements listed in section 9-7-8 of this chapter, but not to the tree replacement requirements listed in section 9-7-7 of this chapter. All other areas of the development shall be subject to both the tree replacement and the tree protection requirements, and all other provisions of this chapter. 
a.  Mitigation for parking: If a person provides parking spaces in addition to the required number of parking spaces, the person shall be required to replace trees which are required to be altered due to the parking or to make payment to the City reforestation fund, or a combination thereof, as directed by the landscape administrator. 
The following formula shall be used to calculate the number of trees to be replaced or the payment due: The landscape administrator shall identify the total number of parking spaces above the number required by the zoning ordinance and calculate the number of trees to be replaced or mitigated based on an equivalent number of spaces in the lot containing the greatest number of trees. 
(h)  Pruning: The landscape administrator may issue a tree permit to allow pruning of a protected tree that alters the tree if such pruning is necessary to allow construction or demolition of a structure. If the landscape administrator issues such a permit, the protected tree covered by the permit shall be exempt from the tree replacement and tree protection requirements of sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8 of this chapter. For all other pruning for which a tree permit is required, sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8 shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  6.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-7. - Tree replacement procedures. 
(a)  Generally: If required by section 9-7-6, above, the following procedures shall apply to any person who alters a protected tree for which a permit is required. 
(b)  Tree replacement: If a person alters a protected tree for which a permit is required, the person shall replace the protected tree with a quality tree as designated in the landscape ordinance and approved by the landscape administrator. This tree replacement requirement is not meant to supplant good site planning. Tree replacement will be considered only after all design alternatives which could save more existing trees have been evaluated and reasonably rejected. 
(1)  Size and number: A sufficient number of trees shall be planted to equal or exceed, in caliper, the diameter of each tree altered, measured at four and one-half feet above ground level. Each replacement tree shall be a minimum of three inch caliper at one foot above ground level, and seven feet in height when planted. 
(2)  Location: Each replacement tree should be planted on the same property as the tree which was altered. However, if the replacement tree cannot be planted on the same property in accordance with universally accepted arborists' standards, the landscape administrator may: 
a.  Require replacement on private property. 
b.  Require replacement on public property, or 
c.  Require payment to the reforestation fund in accordance with subsection 9-7-7(c), below. 
(3)  Responsibility for replacing trees: The landscape administrator will determine the agent responsible for replacing the trees, the time of replacement, and the location of the replacement trees. The requirement to replace trees shall run with the land. 
(4)  Delayed replacement: If the landscape administrator approves the planting of replacement trees more than 30 days after the alteration of protected trees, the applicant shall provide the landscape administrator with an affidavit that all replacement trees will be planted within six months. The landscape administrator may require the person to furnish the City a cash deposit or surety bond in the approximate amount of the cost to replace the trees. 
(5)  Duration: A replacement tree that dies within three years of the date it was planted must be replaced by another replacement tree. This requirement runs with the land. 
(c)  Reforestation fund: If required by the landscape administrator, the applicant, instead of compliance with section 9-7-7(b), above, shall make a payment into the reforestation fund or other specifically dedicated fund. The funds shall be used only for purchasing and planting trees on private property approved by the landscape administrator, on public property, for acquiring wooded property which shall remain in a naturalistic state in perpetuity, or for establishing a landscape or wildlife preserve or similar nature area. 
(1)  The amount of the payment required for each replacement tree shall be calculated based on a schedule published and reviewed annually by the landscape administrator which sets forth the average cost of a quality tree added to the average cost of planting a tree. 
(2)  The landscape administrator shall submit quarterly reports to the City Council of the deposits and disbursements from the reforestation fund. 
(d)  Offense: A person commits an offense if the person fails to replace a tree or make a payment in accordance with the landscape administrator's direction pursuant to this section 9-7-7. 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  7.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-8. - Tree protection procedures. 
(a)  Generally: If required by section 9-7-6, above, the following procedures shall apply to protect any protected tree for which a permit is required. 
(b)  Construction plan requirements: All construction plans shall be specific and identify protected trees and protection procedures. 
(c)  Prohibited activities in critical root zone: The following activities are prohibited within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
(1)  Material storage: No materials intended for use in construction or waste materials accumulated due to excavation or demolition shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree. 
(2)  Equipment cleaning/liquid disposal: No equipment shall be cleaned or other liquids deposited or allowed to flow overland within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree. This includes, without limitation, paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or similar materials. 
(3)  Tree attachments: No signs, wires or other attachments, other than those of a protected tree. Fencing attached to a tree via "U" nails or bent nails is allowed only if the fencing is parallel to and contiguous with the tree. 
(4)  Vehicular traffic: No vehicular and/or construction equipment traffic or parking shall take place within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree other than on existing street pavement. This restriction does not apply to single incident access within the critical root zone for purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for routine utility maintenance, emergency restoration of utility service, or routine mowing operations. 
(5)  Grade changes: No grade changes shall be allowed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree unless adequate construction methods are approved by the landscape administrator. 
(6)  Impervious paving: No paving with asphalt, concrete or other impervious materials that may reasonably be expected to kill a tree shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree except as otherwise allowed in this chapter. 
(d)  Prohibited activities in drip-line: No heavy equipment, including but not limited to trucks, tractors, trailers, bulldozers, bobcat tractors, trenchers, compressors, and hoists, shall be allowed inside the drip-line of any protected tree on any construction site without the specific approval of the landscape administrator. 
(e)  Procedures required prior to construction: The following procedures shall be followed on all types of construction projects (including without limitation residential, commercial, and municipal/public domain projects). 
(1)  Protective fencing: Prior to construction, the contractor or subcontractor shall construct and maintain, for each protected tree on a construction site, a protective fencing which encircles the outer limits of the critical root zone of the tree to protect it from construction activity. All protective fencing shall be in place prior to commencement of any site work and remain in place until all exterior work has been completed. 
(2)  Bark protection: In situations where a protected tree remains in the immediate area of intended construction and the landscape administrator determines the tree bark to be in danger of damage by construction equipment or other activity, the contractor or subcontractor shall protect the tree by enclosing the entire circumference of the tree with 2"x 4" lumber encircled with wire or other means that do not damage the tree. The intent is to protect the bark of the tree against incidental contact by large construction equipment. 
(f)  Construction methods: 
(1)  Boring: Boring of utilities under protected trees shall be required in those circumstances where it is not possible to trench around the critical root zone of the protected tree. When required, the length of the bore shall be the width of the critical root zone at a minimum and shall be a minimum depth of 48 inches. 
(2)  Grade change: In situations in which the landscape administrator approves the grade change within the critical root zone of a protected tree, the procedures noted in the City's standard detail sheet shall be followed. 
(3)  Trenching: All trenching shall be designed to avoid trenching across the critical root zone of any protected tree, unless otherwise approved by the landscape administrator. Trenching within the critical root zone requires a tree permit. The placement of underground utility lines such as electric, phone, gas, etc., is encouraged to be located outside of the critical root zone of protected trees. Trenching for an irrigation system shall be placed outside of the critical root zone, except the minimum required single head supply line as allowed to extend into the critical root zone perpendicular to the tree trunk and in the manner that has the least possible encroachment into the critical root zone. 
(4)  Root pruning: All roots two inches or larger in diameter which are exposed as a result of trenching or other excavation shall be cut off square with a sharp medium tooth saw and covered with pruning compound within two hours of initial exposure. 
((g)  Offense: A person commits an offense if the person violates or fails to comply with this section 9-7-8. 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  8.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-9. - Exceptions to permit fee requirement. 
(a)  City: When altering any protected tree, the City is exempt from the tree permit fee, but must obtain a permit and comply with all tree replacement and tree protection procedures as listed in sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8. Protected trees proposed to be altered must be shown on construction plans approved by the landscape administrator. 
(b)  Diseased, damaged, or dangerous tree: A person is exempt from the tree permit fee if altering a diseased, damaged, or dangerous tree pursuant to section 9-7-6(e), above. 
(c)  Public utilities: When altering any protected tree, a public utility is exempt from the tree permit fee, but must obtain a permit and comply with all tree replacement and tree protection procedures as listed in sections 9-7-7 and 9-7-8. Protected trees proposed to be altered must be shown on construction plans approved by the landscape administrator. 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  9.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-10. - Comprehensive tree plan. 
    It shall be the responsibility of the planning and zoning board in conjunction with the Keep Weatherford Beautiful Board to study, investigate, counsel and develop and/or update periodically, and administer a written plan for the care, preservation, pruning, planting, replanting, removal or disposition of trees and shrubs on all municipal/public domain property. The board shall present the plan to the council and, when adopted by the council, the plan shall represent the comprehensive tree plan for the City. 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  10.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-11. - Street and park trees. 
(a)  Acceptable trees: The landscape administrator shall maintain a list of trees acceptable for planting on municipal/public domain property. Trees other than those listed as acceptable may only be planted upon written approval of the landscape administrator. 
(b)  Street tree spacing: The spacing of street trees will be in accordance with recommendations of the landscape administrator. 
(c)  Stump removals: All stumps of street and park trees shall be removed below the surface of the ground so that the top of the stump shall not project above the surface of the ground. 
(d)  Permit required: A person, other than an agent of the City, must obtain a tree permit before the person may prune, treat, remove, damage, or destroy a street or park tree (regardless of whether it is a protected tree and regardless of whether it is significant enough to "alter" the tree) within the City. A person commits an offense if the person violates this subsection 9-7-11(d). 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  11.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-12. - Tree pruning. 
(a)  Offense: A person commits an offense if the person alters or significantly disfigures a protected tree by pruning. 
(b)  Permit requirements for public utilities: Unless pruning is requested by the owner of the tree or excepted from this chapter pursuant to subsection 9-7-3(c)(2) herein, the public utility shall obtain a tree permit before beginning any pruning (regardless of whether the pruning will alter or significantly disfigure the tree). 
(c)  Pruning technique: When allowed, all pruning shall be conducted in accordance with universally accepted arborists' standards. 
(d)  Required pruning: The owners of all trees adjacent to public right-of-way shall maintain a minimum clearance of 13 feet above the traveled pavement or curb of a public street. Said owners shall remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the public. (Cross-reference: Section 9-7-3(c) of this chapter regarding exceptions.) 
(e)  Tree topping: It shall be unlawful for any person to top any tree without having a tree permit approved by the landscape administrator, unless an exception listed in subsection 9-7-3(c) of this chapter applies. However, if the landscape administrator determines that topping the tree is necessary because the tree has been severely damaged by storms or other causes, or is under utility wires or other obstructions, making other pruning practices impractical, the landscape administrator may issue a tree permit allowing topping of the tree. 
(f)  Ground level cuts: Where protected tree removal is allowed through exemption or by a tree permit, and the root system is intertwined with protected trees which are intended to be saved, the tree shall be removed by flush cutting with the natural level of the surrounding ground. Where stump removal is also desired, stump grinding shall be allowed or, upon approval by the landscape administrator, a trench may be cut between the two trees sufficient to cut the roots near the tree to be removed, thereby allowing removal of the remaining stump without destruction of the root system of the saved tree. 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  12.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-13. - Tree planting restrictions. 
    A person commits an offense if the person: 
(1)  Plants any required replacement tree within an area such that the mature canopy of the tree will interfere with overhead utility lines; 
(2)  Plants any required replacement tree or street tree within an area such that the mature root zone of the tree will interfere with underground public utility lines (including water lines, sewer lines, transmission lines or other utilities); 
(3)  Plants a tree within ten feet of a fire hydrant; or 
(4)  Plants a street tree closer than 35 feet to a street corner, measured from the point of nearest intersecting curbs or curb lines. 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  13.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-14. - Tree survey required before grading. 
    A person commits an offense if the person grades or causes grading on any property in the City prior to obtaining a grading permit. No grading permit shall be issued until a tree survey, if required, has been submitted to and approved by the landscape administrator. 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  14.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-15. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Developer's agreement: The City shall not approve a developer's agreement unless it provides that all construction activities shall meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  Building permit: No building permit shall be issued unless the applicant signs an application or permit request which states that all construction activities shall meet the requirements of this chapter. The building official shall make available to the applicant: 
(1)  A copy of the tree preservation ordinance or a condensed summary of the relevant aspects pertaining to the type of permit requested; and 
(2)  A tree protection sign. 
(c)  Acceptance of improvements: The City may refuse to accept any public improvements until the person pays all civil penalties for violations of this chapter or complies with section 9-7-7 of this chapter; provided, however, that acceptance of public improvements shall be authorized before all trees have been replaced if, with the landscape administrator's approval, the person furnishes the City with a cash deposit or surety bond in the approximate amount of the cost to replace the trees. 
(d)  Certificate of occupancy: No certificate of occupancy (C.O.) shall be issued until all civil penalties for violations of this chapter have been paid to the City. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all replacement trees have been planted or appropriate payments have been made to the reforestation fund; provided, however, that a certificate of occupancy may be granted before all trees have been replaced if, with the landscape administrator's approval, the person furnishes the City with a cash deposit or surety bond in the approximate amount of the cost to replace the trees. 
(Ord. No. 03-21,  15.0, 7-31-03) 
Sec. 9-7-16. - Violations. 
(a)  Any person who: 
(1)  Violates section 9-7-3 of this chapter by altering a protected tree without first obtaining a tree permit from the City, or by altering trees in violation of the permit, or 
(2)  Violates section 9-7-7 of this chapter by failing to follow the tree replacement procedures, shall: 
a.  Be assessed a penalty by the landscape administrator equal to $100.00 per diameter inch of the tree(s) altered; and 
b.  Be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined $100.00 per diameter inch of the tree(s) altered, not to exceed $1,000.00 per incident.

    Application. Consistent with utility board policy, Lake Weatherford will be supplemented with water from the Tarrant Regional Water District system when necessary. In the event that adequate revenue is not generated from the rate stabilization/reserve fund, an additional charge to cover raw water and pumping cost may be added to the existing rate during times that the TRWD water is utilized. The formula to recover this cost is as follows: 
WCAF = ((PWC + PC + APM)/WS) +/- ADF 
    Definitions: 
    WCAF = Water cost adjustment factor. 
    PWC = Purchased water cost for the most recent month. 
    PC = Production cost for the most recent month. 
    APM = Adjustment for previous month over/under WCAF recovery. 
    WS = Total water sales, previous month. 
    ADF = Annualized deferral factor based on projected costs and sales variances keeping a rate stabilization fund minimum as set by the utility board and revised as needed. 
(c)  All bills are due when rendered, and become past due if not paid within ten days from date of bill. Service may be disconnected after proper notice to a customer having past due bills, and an additional charge will be made before service is restored. The municipal utility system may refuse to serve anyone who is in debt to the department.

WEATHER NORMALIZATION ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE [10] 
(a)  Applicability. The Weather Normalization Adjustment Clause (WNA) shall apply to the following general service rate schedules of Texas Gas Service Company in the incorporated areas of Weatherford, Aledo, Hudson Oaks, Willow Park, Mineral Wells, Graford, Millsap, Breckenridge, Graham, Jacksboro and Bryson: 10, 20, 25, 40, and 45. The WNA shall be effective during the September through May billing cycles. 
(b)  Purpose. The WNA refunds over-collections or surcharges under-collections of revenue due to colder or warmer than normal weather, as established in the company's most recent rate filing. 
(c)  WNA mechanism. In order to reflect weather effects in a timely and accurate manner, the WNA adjustment shall be calculated separately for each billing cycle and rate schedule. The weather factor, determined for each rate schedule in the most recent rate case, shows the effect of one heating degree day on consumption for that rate schedule. During each billing cycle, the weather factor is multiplied by the difference between normal and actual heating degree days for the billing period and by the number of customers billed. This WNA volume adjustment is priced at the current cost of service rate per Ccf to determine a WNA revenue adjustment, which is spread to the customers in the billing cycle on a prorata basis. 
(d)  Filing with the cities. The company will file with the city monthly reports showing the rate adjustments for each applicable rate schedule. Supporting documentation will be made available for review upon request. By each October 1, the company will file with the city an annual report verifying the past year's WNA collections or refunds. 
COST OF SERVICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE [11] 
(a)  Applicability. This cost of service adjustment clause applies to all general service rate schedules of Texas Gas Service Company currently in force in the company's service area within the incorporated areas of Aledo, Hudson Oaks, Willow Park, Mineral Wells, Graford, Millsap, Breckenridge, Graham, Jacksboro and Bryson and Weatherford, Texas. 
(b)  Effective date. Rate adjustments shall be made in accordance with the procedures described below on an annual basis. The company shall make its annual filing no later than April 1, with rate adjustments to be effective the first billing cycle of August each year. 
(c)  Components of rate adjustment. Calculation of the rate adjustment will be based on calendar year operating expenses, return on investment, federal income taxes and revenue related taxes. 
The actual percentage change in the revenue requirement after gross-ups in any year shall not exceed the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) from December of the prior calendar year to December of the current calendar year. The actual percentage change in the revenue requirement after gross-ups is computed by comparing the revenue requirement after gross-ups for the current calendar year to the revenue requirement after gross-ups for the prior calendar year. The rate adjustment will be spread evenly across all volumes for the calendar year to determine an adjustment amount per Ccf to be added to existing rates for each rate code. 
(1)  Operating expenses. Operating expenses will be determined by the ending balances for the applicable calendar year. The applicable expenses are: 
Depreciation and amortization expense (Account No. 403-405)* 
Taxes other than FIT (Account No. 408)** 
Distribution expenses (Account Nos. 870-894) 
Customer related expenses (Account Nos. 901-916) 
Administrative and general expenses (Account Nos. 920-932, except 928) 
Interest on customer deposits (Account No. 431) 
* Based on last city-approved depreciation methods and lives. 
** Excluding city franchise, gross receipts, and any other revenue-based tax. 
This information will be presented with supporting calculations. 
(2)  Return on investment. The rate of return will remain constant at the level authorized in the most recent rate case. The return on investment is the rate of return multiplied by the rate base balance for the applicable calendar year end. The rate base balance is composed of: 
Net plant in service Plus: Other rate base items* Less: Customer deposits (Account No. 235) Customer advances (Account No. 252) Deferred federal income taxes  
* These items will reflect the materials and supplies inventories and prepayments levels approved in the most recent general rate case. 
(3)  Federal income taxes. Calendar year federal income taxes will be calculated as follows: 
Net taxable income (calendar year end rate base multiplied by rate of return from the most recent general rate case) Less: Interest on long term debt (debt cost component of return from the most recent general rate case multiplied by rate base) Multiplied by: Tax factor (.35/(1-.35) or .53846)  
(4)  Cost of service adjustment rate. The amount to be collected through the cost of service adjustment rate will be the sum of the amounts from sections (d)(1) through (d)(4) (the revenue requirement) less the calendar year customer charge revenue and other revenue (i.e., transportation revenue and service charges). Dividing this amount by weather-normalized volumes for the applicable calendar year will yield a per unit rate for the calendar year. The difference between this calendar year per unit rate and the per unit rate from the most recent rate case (*) will result in the cost of service adjustment rate for the calendar year. The cost of service adjustment rate for the calendar year will be added to the cost of service rate approved in the most recent rate case for each rate code. 
* The per unit rate from the most recent rate case will be the weighted average per unit cost of service rate for all classes of gas sales service. 
(d)  Regulatory review of annual rate adjustment. The cities will have a period of not less than 90 days within which to review the proposed annual rate adjustment prior to its taking effect with the first billing cycle of August of each year. If a City takes no action within 90 days, the proposed annual rate adjustment will be deemed approved by the city. A city or group of cities may retain a consultant to review the annual rate adjustment filing, and the company agrees to reimburse the actual, aggregate cost of such review(s) up to an amount not to exceed $15,000 per year. Any reimbursement of such costs will be recoverable through the company's annual cost of service adjustment rate. This cost of service adjustment clause does not limit the legal rights and duties of the cities. Texas Gas Service Company's annual rate adjustment will be made in accordance with all applicable laws. Texas Gas Service Company shall not appeal to the Railroad Commission of Texas the denial of its annual rate adjustment by one or more of the cities. However, such denial shall not preclude Texas Gas Service Company from filing a statement of intent to increase rates pursuant to V.T.C.A. Utilities Code  104.102 in such cities.

The rights reserved to the city with respect to the letter of credit are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this chapter, a franchise agreement, or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such letter of credit shall affect any other right the city may have. 
(d)  Endorsement. The letter of credit shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this letter of credit or security deposit may not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until 30 days after receipt by the city, by registered mail, of a written notice of such intention to cancel or not to renew." 
(e)  Receipt as notice. Receipt of the 30 day notice shall be construed as a default granting the city the right to call on the bank for either the security deposit or letter of credit.

(a)  Filed with city. Within 30 days after the award of a franchise under this chapter, a grantee shall file with the city a performance bond in the amount of not less than 50 percent of the budgeted cost to install the system contained in the new application in favor of the city. This bond shall be maintained throughout the construction period and until such time as determined by the city, unless otherwise specified in a franchise agreement. 
(b)  Recovery from bond. If a grantee fails to comply with any law, ordinance or resolution governing a franchise, or fails to comply with, fulfill and perform each term and condition of a franchise as it relates to the conditions relative to the construction of the system, there shall be recoverable jointly and severally, from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of a grantee, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney fees, including the city's legal staff, and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. This section shall be an additional remedy for any and all violations outlined in this chapter. 
(c)  Waiver. The city may, at its discretion, waive or reduce the requirement of a grantee to maintain the bond. However, the city may require a performance bond to be posted by a grantee for any construction in a reasonable amount and upon such terms as determined by the city. 
(d)  Endorsement. The bond shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until 30 days after receipt by the city, by registered mail, a written notice of such intent to cancel and not to renew." Receipt of a 30-day notice pursuant to this section shall be construed as default granting the city the right to call in the bond.

(4)  A grantee, in its application (if any), may propose a system construction timetable which shall ensure that cable service is available in the franchise area sooner than the above minimum requirements, in which case the said schedule will be made part of a franchise agreement, and shall be binding upon such grantee. 
(5)  Any delay beyond the terms of the timetable required by this section or under a franchise agreement, unless otherwise specifically approved by the city, will be considered a violation of this chapter for which the provisions of sections 9-10-12, 9-10-13, 9-10-42 and 9-10-43 of this chapter shall apply, as determined by the city. 
(6)  In special circumstances the city can waive 100 percent completion within the two year time frame provided substantial completion is accomplished within the allotted time frame, substantial completion construed to be not less than 95 percent.

(b)  Line extensions: 
(1)  Extension requirements. A grantee shall be required to extend its system pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. Grantee is hereby authorized to extend the cable system as necessary within the franchise area. 
b.  A grantee must extend and make cable service available to every dwelling unit within the franchise area having at least 20 dwelling units (which shall be interpreted to include businesses which have agreed to subscribe to cable service) planned per street mile, as measured from the existing system, and a grantee shall always extend its system simultaneously with the installation of utility lines. 
c.  A grantee must extend and make cable service available to any isolated resident within the franchise area requesting connection at the standard connection charge, if the connection to the isolated resident would require no more than a standard 150-foot drop line. 
(2)  Early extension. In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of service, a grantee shall provide, upon the request of a potential subscriber desiring service, an estimate of the costs required to extend service to the potential subscriber. A grantee shall then extend service upon the request of the potential subscriber. A grantee may require advance payment or assurance of payment satisfactory to a grantee. The amount paid by potential subscribers for early extensions shall be nonrefundable, and in the event the area subsequently reaches the density required for mandatory extension, such payments shall be treated as consideration for early extension. 
(3)  Undergrounding. In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall give a grantee reasonable notice of such construction or development, and of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for a grantee's installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at a grantee's expense. A grantee shall also provide specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except that if a grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals within five working days of the date the trenches are available, as designated in the notice given by the developer or property owner, then should the trenches be closed after the five-day period, the cost of new trenching is to be borne by a grantee. Except for the notice of the particular date on which trenching will be available to a grantee, any notice provided to a grantee by the city of a preliminary plat request shall satisfy the requirement of reasonable notice if sent to the local general manager or system engineer of a grantee prior to approval of the preliminary plat request. 
(c)  Special agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a grantee from serving areas not covered under this section upon agreement with developers, property owners, or residents provided that five percent of those gross revenues are paid to the city as franchise fees under section 9-10-26 of this chapter. 
(1)  A grantee, in its application, may propose a line extension policy which will result in serving more residents of the city than as required above, in which case such grantee's policy will be incorporated into the franchise agreement, and will be binding on such grantee. 
(2)  The violation of this section shall be considered a breach of the terms of this chapter for which the provisions of sections 9-10-12, 9-10-13, 9-10-42 and 9-10-43 of this chapter shall apply, as determined by the city. 
(Ord. No. 98-13R, 6-9-98)

Sec. 9-10-21. - Use of streets. 
(a)  Interference with persons and improvements. A grantee's system shall be located, erected and maintained so that none of its facilities endanger or interfere with the lives of any person, interfere with the rights or reasonable convenience of any property owner whose property adjoins any of the public rights-of-way, interfere with any improvements the city may deem proper to make, or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the public rights-of-way.

(1)  No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by a grantee without prior approval of the city with regard to location, height, types, and any other pertinent aspect of concern to the city. No location of any pole or wire-holding structure of a grantee shall be a vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by a grantee at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
(2)  Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for use in serving the city are available for use by a grantee, but it does not make arrangement for such use, the city may require a grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to a grantee are reasonable. 
(3)  In the absence of any governing federal or state law, where the city or a public utility serving the city desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of a grantee, but agreement thereof with a grantee cannot be reached, the city may require a grantee to permit such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the city shall determine to be reasonable, if the city determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with a grantee's operations. 
(d)  Relocation of the facilities. If at any time during the term of a franchise, the city alters or changes the grade of any street, alley or other public rights-of-way, a grantee, upon reasonable notice by the city, shall remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense, unless public utilities are compensated by the city, in which case grantee shall be similarly compensated.

(d)  Signal interference. A grantee shall not allow its cable or other operations to interfere with television reception of subscribers or persons not served by a grantee, nor shall the system interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any manner the operation of the various utilities serving the residents within the confines of the city nor shall other utilities interfere with a grantee's system. 
(e)  Qualified staff. A grantee shall have knowledgeable, qualified representatives available to respond to subscriber telephone inquiries via a local, toll-free or collect telephone access line 24 hours per day and seven days per week. 
(f)  Telephone answer time. Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time, including wait time and the time required to transfer the call, shall not exceed 30 seconds. This standard shall be met no less than 90 percent of the time as measured on an annual basis.

Excluding those situations which are beyond its control, a grantee shall respond to any service interruption promptly and in no event later than 24 hours from the time of initial notification. All other regular service requests will be responded to within 36 hours during the normal workweek for that system. The appointment window alternatives for installations, service calls and other installation activities will be: "Morning" or "afternoon", not to exceed a four hour "window" during normal business hours for the system, or at a time that is acceptable to the subscriber. If at any time an installer or technician is running late, an attempt to contact a subscriber will be made and the appointment rescheduled as necessary at a time that is convenient to the subscriber. 
(j)  Service centers. At least one grantee-staffed subscriber service center and bill payment location that is inside the city limits will be open for walk-in transactions a minimum of eight hours a day Monday through Friday unless there is a need to modify those hours because of the location or subscribers served.

Sec. 9-10-23. - Continuation of service mandatory. 
(a)  Uninterrupted service. It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and other obligations to a grantee are honored.

If the city is required to fulfill this obligation for a grantee, a grantee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues from the system received by the city that are the result of a grantee's failure to perform. 
(Ord. No. 98-13R, 6-9-98) 
Sec. 9-10-24. - Complaint procedure. 
(a)  City manager. The city manager is designated as having primary responsibility for the continuing administration of franchises and implementation of complaint procedures.

During the term of a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, and any renewal thereof, a grantee shall maintain a central office for the purpose of receiving and resolving all complaints regarding the quality of service, equipment malfunctions, and similar matters. The office must be reachable by a local, toll-free telephone call to receive complaints regarding quality of service, equipment functions and similar matters. A grantee will use its good faith efforts to arrange for one or more payment locations in a central location where subscribers can pay bills or conduct other business activities. 
(c)  Subscriber information. After installation of service, a grantee shall, by appropriate means such as a card or brochure, furnish subscribers with information concerning the procedures for making inquiries or complaints, including the name, address and local telephone number of the employee or agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed. 
(d)  Special testing. When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the city, casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the city may require a grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system. A grantee shall fully cooperate with the city in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report for the city, if requested by the city, within 30 days after such request by the city. Such report shall include the following information: 
(1)  The nature of the complaint or problem which precipitated the special tests; 
(2)  A description of the system component tested; 
(3)  The equipment used and procedures employed in testing; 
(4)  The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved; 
(5)  Any other information pertinent to the tests and analysis which may be required. 
    The city may require that tests be supervised by an independent professional engineer or consultant of the city's choice. The engineer or consultant should sign all records of special tests and forward to the city such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and recommending actions to be taken. Should such a test prove that a grantee failed to meet the technical standard, a grantee shall bear the cost of the test. If the test should prove that a grantee met the technical standards, the city shall bear the cost of the test. 
    The city's right under this section shall be limited to requiring tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the city has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable service. 
(Ord. No. 98-13R, 6-9-98) 
Sec. 9-10-25. - Grantee rules and regulations. 
    A grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable a grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under a franchise and to assure uninterrupted service to all of its subscribers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 98-13R, 6-9-98) 
Sec. 9-10-26. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  Amount of fee. For the reason that the streets to be used by a grantee in the operation of its system within the city are valuable public assets acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to a grantee to the streets is a valuable property right without which a grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, a grantee shall pay to the city an amount equal to five percent of a grantee's annual gross revenue. If the statutory five percent limitation on franchise fees is raised or the federal statute deletes the franchise fee limitation entirely, then the franchise fee may be subject to renegotiation, upon initiation by the city. 
(b)  When payment due. The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be payable quarterly on a calendar year basis to the city. A grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenue within 45 days after each calendar year quarter. 
(c)  Open books and records. The city shall have the right to inspect a grantee's gross revenue records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter; provided, however, that such audit shall take place within 24 months following the close of each of a grantee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to a grantee by the city which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. 
(d)  Interest on late payments. If any franchise fee payment or recomputed amount, cost or penalty, is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged daily from such date at the legal maximum rate charged by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for late tax payments and a grantee shall reimburse the city for any additional expenses incurred by the city by reason of the delinquent payment(s). 
(Ord. No. 98-13R, 6-9-98) 
Sec. 9-10-27. - Transfer of ownership or control. 
(a)  City review. Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, a franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the city. A grantee may, however, transfer or assign a franchise to a wholly owned subsidiary of a grantee and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the franchise back to a grantee without such consent, providing that such assignment is without any release of liability of a grantee. The proposed assignee must show financial responsibility as determined by the city and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. The city shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such a sale or transfer submitted in writing that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and by the city. The city shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed transfer or assignment if its refusal to consent is not communicated in writing to a grantee within 120 days following receipt of written notice and the necessary information as to the effect of the proposed transfer or assignment upon the public unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension of time. The city shall not unreasonably withhold such consent to the proposed transfer. 
(b)  Notice to cite. Except as may be provided in a franchise agreement, a grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of a grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons comprising 35 percent or more of the voting shares of a grantee. Every change, transfer or acquisition of control of a grantee shall make a franchise subject to cancellation unless the city shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and a grantee shall assist the city in such inquiry. 
(c)  No waiver. The consent or approval of the city to any transfer of a grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of any rights of the city, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of this chapter. 
(d)  Initial franchises. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of an initial franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of the proposed system. 
(e)  Franchise agreement required. In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to a franchise agreement.

(4)  Cooperation required.

Sec. 9-12-8. - Franchise fees. 
(a)  As full consideration for the rights and privileges conferred by this franchise ordinance, and as a charge for the use of the streets, alleys and public ways, grantee shall collect from its customers and pay to the city a sum of money, known as the "franchise fee", equal to the sum of the following: 
(1)  $0.025 for each Ccf of natural gas sold by grantee to grantee's gas sales customers located in the city; and 
(2)  Four percent of grantee's actual gross receipts from gas transportation [as defined in subsection (b) of this section] provided to grantee's gas transportation customers with re-delivery points located in the city. 
(b)  Subject to the other provisions herein: 
(1)  Gross receipts from gas transportation shall be defined in accordance with grantee's tariffs, more specifically as grantee's total receipts from its transportation of third party transport gas for re-delivery to customers with re-delivery points located within the corporate limits of the city, consisting of its receipts from cost of service and excluding the cost or value of the transport gas; and 
(2)  Gross receipts from gas transportation subject to franchise fee shall specifically exclude, but not be limited from excluding: 
a.  Receipts from non-regulated miscellaneous service charges; 
b.  Receipts from gas transportation services to customers located at delivery points outside the corporate limits of the city; 
c.  Receipts from gas transported by grantee for its own use; 
d.  Bad debt or uncollected accounts; 
e.  Receipts collected for gas utility taxes (V.T.C.A., Utility Code ch. 122); 
f.  Receipts for any taxes, assessments, charges or fees of any kind, other than franchise fees and gross receipts taxes; 
g.  Receipts for construction advances or contributions in aid of construction; 
h.  Receipts for maintenance of machinery or equipment; 
i.  Receipts for compensation for damage to grantee's property; 
j.  Receipts from sales of materials or equipment; 
k.  Receipts from any non-utility or non-regulated services or products; and 
l.  Receipts for the generation of electricity. 
(c)  Unless expressly set forth herein, or otherwise provided by law, by accepting this franchise ordinance, grantee does not agree to be responsible for the payment of franchise fees owed to the city by any other entity, corporation or firm. It is expressly agreed and understood by grantee and the city that the franchise fees due herein shall be based upon volumes of gas sold by grantee to, and revenues received by grantee from gas transported for, its customers located in the city [all as defined in subsection (a) of this section] and shall not be based, in any way, upon any other sources of receipts, revenues, contributions, or any other sources of income. 
(d)  During the term of this franchise ordinance, grantee shall collect from its customers and pay the city in January, April, July and October for the preceding three months. Grantee shall include with the franchise fee payment a statement showing the total number of Ccfs of gas sold by grantee and total gross receipts for gas transportation in the city, including the calculation of the franchise fee for the subject time period. Such statement shall be in a mutually agreeable format. Collection and payment of franchise fees shall be final as to both parties unless questioned by written notice provided to the other party within two years after payment thereof has been made. 
(e)  It is expressly agreed that the franchise fee payments shall be in lieu of any payments for the right to use the public rights-of-way of the city, including expressly the street usage fees authorized by V.T.C.A. Tax Code  182.021-182.026 and 182.081-182.082, or any successor statute permitting such a charge, however designated. The franchise fee shall be in lieu of and accepted as payment of all of grantee's obligations to pay all other franchise, license, easement or occupation taxes, levies, exactions, fees, rentals, street-cut fees, inspection fees, permit fees, franchise fees, easement taxes, or charges of any kind whatsoever which may be levied or attempted to be levied by the city for use of city's public ways, with the sole exception of sales taxes and ad valorem taxes. 
(f)  It is expressly agreed by the city that the franchise fees defined in this franchise ordinance are a reasonable and necessary operating expense of grantee and shall be fully recovered by grantee by collection from its customers in the city, whether asserted retroactively or prospectively, by revising its rate schedules, assessing an additional charge to the monthly bills of its customers within the city, adding an additional charge to the grantee's purchased gas adjustment clause for the city or in any legal manner determined in grantee's discretion. 
(g)  The city, or its designee, may, upon reasonable prior written notice and during reasonable business hours, inspect and review the books and records of grantee to verify the amount of franchise fees due. It is understood and agreed that such representative may be an independent agent, assigned by the city commission to conduct the inspection of grantee's books and records for the reconciliation of franchise fee payments to determine the accuracy thereof. 
(h)  The rights, privileges, and franchises granted by this franchise ordinance are not to be considered exclusive, and city hereby expressly reserves the right to grant, at any time as it may see fit, like privileges, rights, and franchises to any other person or corporation for the purpose of furnishing gas in the city. In the event any entity providing gas sales or gas transportation service to customers within the city (other than grantee) is not legally required to pay the same or an equivalent franchise fee as required to be collected and paid by grantee in this franchise ordinance, then with respect to gas sales or transportation service to those specific customers, grantee's franchise fee obligation resulting from sales or transportation service to those specific customers may be automatically reduced by grantee to a level equivalent to the amount the city legally requires to be paid by such other entity. 
(i)  The city shall be paid a franchise fee once with respect to the same gas sold and/or transported within the city. Should the city receive or be entitled to receive from any other company, firm, corporation or person a franchise fee or similar street rental fee payment from the transportation and/or sale of the same or equivalent gas, the aggregate amount which the city has received or is entitled to receive with respect to the same or equivalent gas transported and/or sold by grantee shall be deducted from, and reported with, the franchise fee payment to be made to the city by grantee hereunder. Among other things, this section is intended to apply to gas purchased by grantee for resale to its customers within the city and to transport gas redelivered by grantee within the city. Upon request of grantee, the city agrees to provide grantee, within a reasonable time of its receipt, with written notice setting forth the amounts of any such franchise fee or other fee received for the use of its streets for the transportation or sale of gas in the city that is ultimately transported or delivered through grantee's system in the city. 
(j)  It is recognized by the city that the intent of subsections (h) and (i) of this section is to ensure that, with respect to franchise fees, grantee is on a level playing field with its competitors so as to avoid unjust discrimination against grantee. 
(k)  Effective January 1, 2009 and annually thereafter, each of the franchise rates, as specified in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, shall increase by an amount equivalent to the 12 months percent change for October of the previous year as reflected in the Consumer Price Index, "Unadjusted indexes, U.S. city average, all items, (Series ID CUUR0000SAO)" as published by the U.S. Department of Labor. Upon such annual adjustments, neither the new franchise rate per Ccf when multiplied by the volumes of natural gas sold by the grantee, nor the new percentage rate applicable to transport gas (with both compared to the previous 12 months ending in October) shall exceed five percent of the total Weatherford revenues (from the previous 12 months ending in October) from natural gas sales and gas transportation subject to the franchise fee.

    Resolution of any dispute arising under this franchise ordinance between the city and the grantee, or any of its affiliates (collectively the "parties, or individually a party") shall first be attempted by submitting the dispute to mediation. The dispute shall be submitted to mediation upon the written demand of either party. The mediation shall be held in Parker County, Texas at the location designated by the party demanding the mediation. The mediator shall be selected by agreement within 20 calendar days from the date the demand for mediation is received by the other party. If an agreement cannot be reached on a mediator within the time period stated herein, each party shall submit the name of a mediator and the selection will be made by chance drawing. The party not making the demand for mediation shall make the blind draw from the names submitted in the presence of the other party. Thereafter, the mediation shall be held at the selected designation within 30 calendar days. Mediation of any dispute shall be a condition precedent to filing a lawsuit, except that nothing herein shall preclude a party from seeking a mandatory or prohibitive injunction, or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce or maintain the status quo pending mediation of any dispute.

To protect the water and sewer system, no person, agency, or contractor will be allowed to directionally bore longitudinally or vertically with water and sewer mains that are 12 inches or larger, unless this requirement is waived in writing by the director of utilities. The installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way or easements will be installed by open excavation to assure the protection of the city's water and sewer system. The city has available mapping that identifies such mains. The owner is responsible for obtaining and using this information in the design of new facilities. 
(10)  The working hours in the rights-of-way are 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, unless otherwise approved by director. Any work performed on Saturday must be approved by the director by 9:00 a.m. on the Thursday prior to the proposed Saturday. No work will be done, except for emergencies, on Sundays or city holidays. 
(11)  Work that obstructs the flow of vehicular traffic on a street, alley, or sidewalk for more than two hours must submit a traffic control plan in accordance with the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The traffic control plan must be approved by the director prior to issuance of construction permit. Unless the work is performed under emergency conditions, the permittee shall submit traffic control plans as soon as practical to the director. All traffic control plans shall be in accordance with the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). 
(12)  Persons working in the right-of-way are responsible for obtaining line locates from all affected utilities or others with facilities in the right-of-way prior to any excavation. Use of geographic information system or the plans of the records does not satisfy this requirement. 
(13)  Permittee or contractor will be responsible for verifying the location, both horizontal and vertical, of all facilities. When required by the director, owner shall verify locations by pot holing, hand digging or other method approved by the department prior to any excavation or boring. 
(14)  Locate flags shall not be removed from a location while facilities are being constructed. 
(15)  When construction requires pumping of water or mud, the water or mud shall be contained in accordance with federal and state law and the directives of the department. 
(16)  A person shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations on other similar users of the public right-of-way. The city shall waive the requirements of trenchless technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the person. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. A person shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(17)  All construction shall confirm to the City of Weatherford Tree Preservation Ordinance. Any exceptions will need to be approved by the director prior to construction. 
(18)  Excavation safety. On construction projects in which excavation will exceed a depth of five feet, the Agency must be in conformance with State Law and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards and regulations. 
(19)  The department or the owner can request a pre-construction meeting with the construction contractor. 
(20)  If a permittee performs or has performed on the permittee's behalf, a pavement cut on a road, street, or other paved surface in the city's public rights-of-way, where that paved surface was last resurfaced three years or less from the date of the pavement cut undertaken by the permittee, then the permittee shall repair the stretch of paved surface from the edge of the two nearest intersections between which the permittee performed its pavement cut. 
(21)  No pavement cuts in newly constructed, reconstructed or resurfaced (greater than one inch) asphalt streets shall be made for 60 months after the completion of the street work. The permitee may submit written documentation and the director may grant an exception based on finding that the following criteria have been met: 
a.  Boring or jacking without disturbing the pavement is not practical due to physical characteristics of the street or alley or other utility conflicts; and 
b.  Alternative utility alignments that do not involve excavating the street or alley are found to be impracticable; and 
c.  The proposed excavation cannot reasonably be delayed until five year deferment period has lapsed; or 
d.  Emergency service restoration is required and no other timely alternatives are available; or 
e.  New technology that sufficiently minimizes damage to the pavement structure is available; or 
f.  A utility line required to be located is located under the pavement. 
(c)  Application fee. Any applicant seeking to place facilities on, in, over, under, or above the public rights-of-way, shall pay a $35.00 construction permit application fee (except certificated telecommunications providers and their contractors to the extent exempted by Tex. Loc. Gov't Code, Chapter 283 and network providers as prescribed by Tex. Loc. Gov. Code, Chapter 284) and shall file an application for such construction permit with the Director and shall abide by the terms and provisions of this chapter pertaining to use of the public rights-of-way. If there are additional direct costs to the city in processing the applications, the city may recover those from the applicant prior to the issuance of the permit. 
(d)  Compliance with design documents and design manual. Applicant's proposed work with respect to use of the city's public rights-of-way shall comply with the approved design documents and any design manual adopted by the city pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov. Code  284.108. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to obligate city to grant applicant a permit to construct any facilities in, on, under, over, or above the city's public rights-of-way where applicant has failed to fulfill the requirements of this chapter, or if the application to do so is denied based on the criteria described in this chapter. 
(e)  No property rights. All city's public rights-of-way shall remain the property of city and no consideration provided by applicant shall create or vest in applicant or permittee any ownership right, title, or interest in any of the city's public rights-of-way and permittee's interest shall remain a bare license. The existence of any permit granted under this chapter shall not in any way alter or affect city's right to use, change, operate, maintain, or abandon its public rights-of-way. The city shall not be liable to any person for alterations to or abandonment of any right-of-way nor shall it be responsible for providing alternate placement for any facilities. 
(f)  Permit not exclusive. The city has allowed, and may allow in the future, similar or other uses of city's public rights-of-way by third parties, including permittee's competitors. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or in any way affect city's right or ability to enter into or honor other agreements, or to grant any rights, licenses, or access concerning any of city's public rights-of-way, irrespective of the character or degree of economic competition or loss caused to permittee. 
(g)  Discretion of city final. City reserves the right to deny any application pursuant to the terms and conditions of this chapter, or pursuant to other city ordinances, or for legal, safety, mechanical, structural, engineering, environmental, reliability, quality-of-service reasons, or to protect the public's general welfare. Determination of these issues shall at all times remain within the reasonable discretion of city, subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of this chapter. 
(h)  Compliance with existing franchise ordinance or agreement. Any person, prior to placing, reconstructing, or altering facilities in, on, or over the public rights-of-way, including facilities or equipment for the provision of wireless communications, must obtain separate municipal authorization from the city, such as a license agreement or franchise, as may be applicable. For use of the public rights-of-way, all users of the public rights-of-way shall compensate the city on the value of the rights-of-way used, being typically either on a gross receipts basis or on a linear foot basis, to the fullest extent allowed by law. This chapter does not authorize the placement of any facilities on the city's electric utility's poles or other structures. 
(i)  Compensation. Permittee, or any person using the city's public rights-of-way, shall compensate city for use of city's public rights-of-way to the extent allowed by law. Failure by the city to demand compensation shall not constitute a waiver of its right to pursue compensation if it determines it may be due. 
(j)  Application process. Applicant must submit an application with its design documents on the then-approved city form or format to the director. The content of the application form, and all required supporting documentation and other procedures, are within the reasonable discretion of city and may change from time to time without prior notice as determined by the director or his or her designee, provided such changes are not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this chapter. Applications shall identify with sufficient specificity the location at which applicant seeks to install or place its facilities, and shall include all engineering drawings and installation details. City may reject entirely an incomplete application, or it may request additional information to support the application, in which event the requested information shall be promptly furnished and the application shall not be deemed filed until it is complete. 
(k)  Storm water and erosion control. A person using or intending to use the city's public rights-of-way may be required to show proof of engineered plans relating to storm water management and erosion control when applicable or a letter stating a person is not required to obtain such plans. A person shall be responsible for storm water management erosion control that complies with city, state and federal guidelines, as applicable. 
(l)  Warranties and proof of compliance. As part of applicant's application, applicant shall represent and warrant that: 
(1)  Applicant is providing no services for which it owes the city compensation under the provisions of Chapter 283 of the Local Government Code; 
(2)  In its application. Applicant shall provide to the city a complete report on the nature of the services provided with its facilities; and 
(3)  To the extent services to be provided over the facilities for which a construction permit is sought are not being provided to end-use customers, applicant shall provide adequate proof that the provider of services to whom applicant's proposed facilities connect and provides services to the end-use customer within the city will remit the requisite fees for use of the city's public right-of-way pursuant to Local Government Code 283.055(1) and (k). 
(m)  Notices. Application hereunder shall contain the name, address, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and email addresses of the point of contact for all notices required or to be provided to applicant under this chapter. Such point of contact shall be an individual with authority to bind the applicant and/or the owner of the facilities for which a construction permit is sought to conform the use of the public right-of-way to the requirements of this chapter. Permittee, or any person using the city's public rights-of-way, shall supply and maintain a 24-hour emergency telephone number for contact to report damage to facilities or other situations requiring immediate communications.

b.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or "Go" is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk" signal. 
(5)  In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this chapter shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application.

(2)  Railroad crossings. This section shall not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules set forth in chapter 7 of this title. 
(Code 1962) 
Sec. 10-3-8. - Display of unauthorized signs, signals or markings.

(b)  No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial advertising.

(Code 1962) 
Sec. 10-3-12. - Specifically controlled streets.

Title XI - SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is Ord. No. 2002-22, being the subdivision ordinance of the city, adopted September 10, 2002. Formerly, Title XI pertained to similar subject matter as enacted by Ord. No. 91-1, adopted March 23, 1991, as amended. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 11-1-1. - Authority; extension to extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
(a)  This Ordinance is adopted under the authority of the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas, including Chapter 212, Texas Local Government Code, being adopted after a public hearing on the matter held on September 10, 2002. 
(b)  The following rules and regulations are hereby adopted as the Subdivision Ordinance of the City of Weatherford, Texas, also referred to herein as "this ordinance". The city council hereby extends the application of this ordinance to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Weatherford, as that area may exist from time to time. This ordinance shall be applicable to the filing of plats and the subdivision of land, as that term is defined herein and in chapter 212 of the Texas Local Government Code, within the corporate limits of the City of Weatherford and its extraterritorial jurisdiction as they may be from time to time adjusted by annexation or disannexation. The city shall have all remedies and rights provided by said chapter 212 with regard to the control and approval of subdivisions and plats both within the city and within its extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  1.1, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-1-2. - Interpretation and purpose. 
    In the interpretation and application of the provisions of this ordinance, it is the intention of the city council that the principles, standards and requirements provided for herein shall be minimum requirements for the platting and developing of subdivisions within the City of Weatherford and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
    The subdivision (i.e., platting) of land is the first step in the process of development. The distribution and relationship of residential, nonresidential and agricultural uses throughout the community, along with the system of improvements for thoroughfares, utilities, public facilities and community amenities, determine, in large measure, the quality of life enjoyed by the residents of the city. Health, safety, economy, amenities, environmental sensitivity, and convenience are all factors which influence and determine a community's quality of life and overall character. A community's quality of life is of the public interest. Consequently, the subdivision of land, as it affects a community's quality of life, is an activity where regulation is a valid function of municipal government. The regulations contained herein are intended to encourage the development of a quality municipal environment by establishing standards for the provision of adequate light, air, open space, storm water drainage, transportation, public utilities and facilities, and other needs necessary for ensuring the creation and continuance of a healthy, attractive, safe and efficient community that provides for the conservation, enhancement and protection of its human and natural resources. Through the application of these regulations, the interests of the public, as well as those of public and private parties, both present and future, having interest in property affected by this ordinance, are protected by the granting of certain rights and privileges. By establishing a fair and rational procedure for developing land, the requirements in this ordinance further the possibility that land will be developed for its most beneficial use in accordance with existing social, economic and environmental conditions. 
    The procedure and standards for the development, layout and design of subdivisions of land within the corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Weatherford, Texas are intended to: 
(1)  Promote the development and the utilization of land in a manner that assures an attractive and high quality community environment in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan and the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Weatherford; 
(2)  Guide and assist property owners and applicants in the correct procedures to be followed, and to inform them of the standards that shall be required; 
(3)  Protect the public interest by imposing standards for the location, design, class and type of streets, walkways (sidewalks), alleys, utilities and essential public services; 
(4)  Assist orderly, efficient and coordinated development within the city limits and the extraterritorial jurisdiction; 
(5)  Provide neighborhood conservation and prevent the development of slums and blight; 
(6)  Integrate the development of various tracts of land into the existing community, and coordinate the future development of adjoining tracts; 
(7)  Provide that the cost of improvements to minimum standards that primarily benefit the tract of land being developed be borne by the owners or developers of the tract, and that the cost of improvements to minimum standards which primarily benefit the whole community be borne by the whole community as contained in this ordinance; 
(8)  Ensure the most efficient and beneficial provision of public facilities and services for each tract being subdivided; 
(9)  Provide for compatible relationships between land uses and buildings; provide for the circulation of traffic throughout the municipality, having particular regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways; provide for pedestrian circulation that is appropriate for the various uses of land and buildings; and provide the proper location and width of streets; 
(10)  Prevent pollution of the air, streams and bodies of water; assure the adequacy of drainage facilities; safeguard both surface and groundwater supplies, as well as natural resources and endangered or threatened plant and animal life; and encourage the wise use and management of natural resources throughout the municipality in order to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the community and the value of the land; 
(11)  Preserve the natural beauty and topography of the municipality, and ensure development that is appropriate with regard to these natural features; 
(12)  Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision; 
(13)  Ensure that public or private facilities are available and will have sufficient capacity to serve proposed and future developments and citizens within the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction; 
(14)  Protect and provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of the community; 
(15)  Provide for adequate light, air and privacy; secure safety from fire, flood and other danger; and prevent overcrowding of the land and undue congestion of population; 
(16)  Protect the character and the social and economic stability of all parts of the community, and encourage the orderly and beneficial development of all parts of the community; 
(17)  Protect and conserve the value of land throughout the community and the value of buildings and improvements upon the land, and minimize conflicts among the uses of land and buildings; 
(18)  Guide public and private policy and action in providing adequate and efficient transportation systems, public utilities, and other public amenities and facilities; and 
(19)  Encourage the development of a stable, prospering economic environment. 
    Minimum standards for development are contained in the City's Technical Construction Standards and Specifications (TCSS), the Zoning Ordinance, the Building Code, applicable articles of the Code of Ordinances, and in this ordinance. However, the comprehensive plan (including the Future Land Use Plan, Thoroughfare Plan, Park and Open Space Plan, and other related plans) contains policies designed to achieve an optimum quality of development in Weatherford and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. If only the minimum standards are followed, as expressed by the various ordinances regulating land development, a standardization of development will occur. This will produce a monotonous municipal setting and physical environment within the community. Subdivision design shall be of a quality that will carry out the purpose and spirit of the policies expressed within the Comprehensive Plan and within this ordinance, and shall be encouraged to exceed the minimum standards required herein.

Where the planning and zoning board recommends, and the city council subsequently finds, that undue hardships will result from strict compliance with a certain provision(s) of this ordinance, or where the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve a waiver/suspension from any portion of these regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest is secured, provided that the waiver/suspension shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations, and further provided that the city council shall not approve a waiver/suspension unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
(1)  Granting the waiver/suspension will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare, and will not be injurious to other property or to the owners of other property, and the waiver/suspension will not prevent the orderly subdivision of other property in the vicinity; 
(2)  The conditions upon which the request for a waiver/suspension is based are unique to the property for which the waiver/suspension is sought, and are not applicable generally to other property; 
(3)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape and/or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the property owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out; 
(4)  The waiver/suspension will not in any manner vary the provisions of the zoning ordinance or comprehensive plan or any other adopted plan(s) or ordinance(s) of the city; 
(5)  An alternate design will generally achieve the same result or intent as the standards and regulations prescribed herein. 
Such findings of the city council, together with the specific facts upon which such findings are based, shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the city council meeting at which a waiver/suspension is considered. A waiver/suspension from any provision of this ordinance may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance so that the public health, safety and welfare may be secured and substantial justice done. Pecuniary hardship to the property owner or developer, standing alone, shall not be deemed to constitute undue hardship. 
(b)  Criteria for waivers/suspensions from development exactions. Where the city council finds that the imposition of any development exaction pursuant to these regulations exceeds reasonable benefit to the property owner, or is so excessive as to constitute confiscation of the tract to be platted, it may approve a full or partial, at its discretion, waiver/suspension to such requirements, so as to prevent such excess. 
(c)  Conditions. In approving a waiver/suspension, the city council may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the purposes described in section 11-1-2. 
(d)  Procedures. 
(1)  A petition for a waiver/suspension shall be submitted in writing by the property owner before the plat is submitted for the consideration of the planning and zoning board. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application, and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner. 
(2)  Where a hardship is identified during concept plan review pursuant to the zoning ordinance or during subdivision plat review pursuant to this ordinance which requires issuance of a waiver/suspension from a provision in this ordinance, the board may recommend a conditional (or temporary) waiver/suspension from that provision in this ordinance in conjunction with concept plan or plat approval by the city council. A conditional or temporary waiver/suspension from this ordinance shall receive final approval along with a preliminary plat provided that the preliminary plat conforms to the concept plan, and that no new information or reasonable alternative plan exists that, at the determination of the city council, voids the need for a waiver/suspension. All waivers/suspensions shall have final approval or disapproval by the city council. 
(e)  Criteria for waivers/suspensions for street exactions. Where the city council finds that the imposition of any dedication or construction requirement for streets pursuant to these regulations exceeds reasonable benefit to the property to be platted, it may approve waivers/suspensions for such requirements so as to prevent such excess. In order to qualify for a waiver/suspension under this section, the property owner shall demonstrate that the costs of right-of-way dedication and construction of nonlocal streets imposed pursuant to these regulations substantially exceeds the incremental costs of providing land and transportation improvements necessary to offset the additional traffic impacts generated by, or attributable to, the development upon the transportation network serving the property, including that which may be generated by or attributed to other phases to be platted in the future.

ARTICLE II. - PROCEDURES 

Sec. 11-2-1. - Complete application required. 
(a)  Completeness determination. Every application for approval of a master plat, preliminary plat or final plat shall be subject to a determination of completeness by the planning director. No application shall be accepted for processing unless it is accompanied by all documents required by and prepared in accordance with the requirements of these subdivision regulations. The director from time to time may identify additional requirements for a complete application that are not contained within but are consistent with the application contents and standards set forth in the subdivision regulations. The director also may promulgate a fee for review of the application for completeness. 
(b)  Incompleteness as grounds for denial. The processing of an application by any city official or employee prior to the time the application is determined to be complete shall not be binding on the city as the official acceptance of the application for filing, and the incompleteness of the application shall be grounds for denial or revocation of the application. A determination of completeness shall not constitute a determination of compliance with the substantive requirements of these subdivision regulations. 
(c)  Pre-application conference. A property owner may request a pre-application conference with the director for purposes of identifying requirements that are applicable to a proposed plat. The request shall be made in writing on a form prepared by the director and shall state that any proposed development concept discussed at the pre-application conference is not intended as a plan of development or application for plat approval. 
(d)  Time for making determination. Following submission of a plan of development or plat application, the planning director shall make a determination in writing whether the plan or application constitutes a complete application for a master plat, a preliminary plat or a final plat not later than the tenth business day after the date the application is submitted. The determination shall specify the documents or other information needed to complete the application and shall state the date the application will expire if the documents or other information is not provided. 
(e)  When deemed complete. An application for approval of a concept plan or preliminary plat that is filed on or after April 28, 2005, or any subsequent preliminary plat or final plat application filed after approval of such concept plan or preliminary plat, shall be deemed complete on the 11th business day after the application has been received, if the applicant has not otherwise been notified that the application is incomplete. 
(f)  Time for completing application. If an application is not completed on or before the 45th day after the application is submitted to the planning director for processing the application in accordance with his or her written notification, the application will be deemed to have expired and it will be returned to the applicant together with any accompanying documents. Thereafter, a new application for approval of the master plat, preliminary plat or final plat must be submitted. The city may retain any fee paid for reviewing the application for completeness. 
(g)  Sequence of applications. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision ordinance to the contrary, an application for a master plat, preliminary plat or final plat shall not be considered complete unless accompanied by a copy of the zoning ordinance or other certification verifying that the proposed use for which the application is submitted is authorized by the zoning district in which the property is located. 
(h)  Vested rights. No vested rights accrue solely from the filing of an application that has expired pursuant to this section, or from the filing of a complete application that is subsequently denied. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  2.1, 9-10-02; Ord. No. 168-2005-48,  1, 8-9-05) 
Sec. 11-2-2. - Statutory procedures. 
(a)  Zoning requirements. A property within the city's corporate limits that is being proposed for platting or development must be properly zoned by the city prior to submission of an application for approval of any concept plan or plat. In addition, the proposed development layout or subdivision design shown on the proposed concept plan or plat must be in conformance with all standards and requirements prescribed in the city's zoning ordinance and this ordinance. 
    Noncompliance with the requirements of the zoning district in which the subject property is located, or lack of the proper zoning, shall constitute grounds for denial of the concept plan or plat. In situations where the zoning on a particular piece of property cannot be ascertained by the city, the burden of proof regarding the property's zoning shall rest with the property owner. Proof of proper zoning shall consist of appropriate documentation, such as a copy of the ordinance establishing the zoning, which shall be reviewed by city officials as to its validity and authenticity. 
    Any concept plan or plat submitted for approval by the city shall be in accordance with the city's zoning ordinance, if the property is located within the city's corporate limits, and, if the property is located within the city's corporate limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction, it shall be in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan, including all adopted water, sewer, storm drainage, future land use, park, recreation, open space and thoroughfare plans. All plats shall be prepared by a licensed civil engineer or a registered professional land surveyor. 
(b)  Classification of subdivisions and additions. Before any land is filed for record with the county clerk, the property owner shall apply for and secure city council approval of the required subdivision plat, in accordance with the following procedures, unless otherwise provided within this ordinance. 
(1)  Minor subdivisions may be approved for residential or nonresidential properties. Minor plat approval by the mayor or chief executive officer (or designee) requires the submission of a final plat drawing and other submission materials required by section 11-2-11 of this ordinance. Lots may be conveyed or sold only when the mayor or chief executive officer has approved the plat and the plat has been filed at Parker County. 
(2)  Major subdivisions may be approved for residential or nonresidential properties. The procedure for approval of a major subdivision typically involves two to three steps: a concept plan (which is voluntary), preliminary plat and final plat. Sections 11-2-3 through 11-2-6 of this ordinance provide the requirements for each. Major plat approval shall be in accordance with sections 11-2-4 through 11-2-6 of this ordinance. Upon completion of the required public improvements, or upon submission and city approval of the appropriate surety for public improvements, the property owner may submit the final plat for approval. All major subdivision plats must be reviewed by the board and approved by the city council, pursuant to sections 11-2-4 through 11-2-8 of this ordinance. Lots may be sold only when the final plat has been approved by the city council and the plat has been filed at Parker County. If the land is required to be platted, no conveyance or sale of any portion or lot of the property may occur until after the final plat is approved by the city council and filed at Parker County. 
(c)  Submission requirements for all types of plat applications. In addition to the requirements outlined herein for each type of development application, the city shall maintain separate policies and procedures for the submission and processing of applications including, but not limited to, application forms, checklists, language blocks for plats, and other similar items. The forms and paperwork are available at the office of the city manager/mayor, or designee. These policies and procedures may be amended from time to time, and it is the applicant's responsibility to be familiar with, and to comply with, these policies and procedures. 
(d)  Official submission date and completeness of application for all types of plats. 
(1)  For the purpose of these regulations, the "official submission date" shall be the date upon which a complete application for approval of any type of plat, that contains all required elements mandated by the Texas Local Government Code, section 212.004(b) and by this ordinance, is submitted to the city manager/mayor (or designee), after which the statutory period required for approval or disapproval of the plat shall commence to run. No application shall be deemed officially submitted until the city manager/mayor (or designee) determines that the application is complete and a fee receipt is issued by the city. Failure by the city manager/mayor (or designee) to make a determination of incompleteness within ten calendar days following the date on which the application was first received by the city, shall result in the application being deemed complete, and the "official submission date" shall become the 11th calendar day following initial receipt of the application by the city. 
(2)  Plat applications which do not include all required information and materials, as outlined below and per other city development review policies which may change from time to time, will be considered incomplete, shall not be accepted for official submission by the city, and shall not be scheduled on a commission agenda until the proper information is provided to city officials including the city's retained planning and engineering consultants, if applicable. 
(3)  Pursuant to the Texas Local Government Code, Section 212.009(a) and Section 212.009(b), the planning and zoning board shall act on a complete plat application within 30 calendar days of the "official submission date" and the city council shall act on said complete application within 30 calendar days after the application is considered by the planning and zoning board. 
(e)  Submission procedures and city review process for all types of plats. 
(1)  Submission timing. A complete application for approval of any plat shall be received and accepted by the city at least 24 calendar days, but no more than 30 calendar days prior to the board meeting at which it is to be considered, unless the applicant waives the 30-day requirement for action on the plat in writing. 
a.  Due to state-mandated notification requirements, any residential replat that requires public notification (see section 11-2-8) shall be submitted to the city at least 30 calendar days prior to the board meeting at which it is to be considered. Such replat application shall also be accompanied by a written waiver of the 30-day requirement for action on the plat due to timing constraints imposed by publication of the required notice in the city's official newspaper. 
(2)  Submission materials. The application shall include a written application form which bears the original notarized signature(s) of the property owner(s) of the subject property, along with the appropriate submission fee, the appropriate number of full-size folded (24?  36?) prints of the plat (per the city's folding requirements, available at City Hall), as required by the city's current development review policies and requirements, one 81/2?  11? and one 11? x 17? black-and-white reductions of the plat, a copy of any applicable development agreement pertaining to the subject property (if any), and any other applicable information and materials deemed appropriate by the city. One copy of all of the above materials and plans shall be simultaneously submitted to the city planner and the city engineer for review in order for the application to be deemed complete. 
The application shall be accompanied by a certificate or other satisfactory evidence from the Parker County Central Appraisal District showing that all taxes have been paid on the subject property, and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property, in accordance with section 11-1-10. Documentation shall also be included that shows no delinquent assessments, fees, or other debts or obligations to the city and which are directly attributable to the subject property. One copy of the tax status certificate shall be simultaneously submitted to the city planner in order for the application to be deemed complete. 
The application shall also be accompanied by an engineer's summary report which describes, in as much detail as necessary, the following: 
a.  The overall nature and scope of the proposed development, including zoning of the property (and including the ordinance number that established the property's current zoning), 
b.  Proposed use(s) and acreage of each proposed use, minimum lot sizes, widths and depths, number of lots to be created, and special amenities or facilities that will be included in the development; 
c.  How the property will be served with required utilities and services; 
d.  How storm water drainage will be handled; 
e.  An itemization and description of any waivers/suspensions from provisions of this ordinance that will be sought; 
f.  If the proposed development will have access points onto a major thoroughfare, the application shall include a letter from the appropriate entity, such as TxDOT or Parker County, acknowledging and approving proposed driveway locations and corresponding median openings and left turn lanes, as applicable; 
g.  Letters from each of the applicable utility service providers, including water, wastewater, gas, electricity, telephone, cable TV and solid waste, verifying their ability to provide an adequate level of service for the proposed development; and 
h.  Letters from the area independent school districts (as applicable) may also be required that acknowledge the district(s) has been informed of the size (with respect to the anticipated number of homes and/or school-age children), location and timing of the proposed development, and that expresses any desire the district may have to obtain a future school site within any portion of the subject property. 
One copy of items a. through h. above (and any associated plans) shall be simultaneously submitted to the city planner and the city engineer for review in order for the application to be deemed complete. 
All plat drawings and other corresponding plans and drawings, including engineering plans and landscape and screening plans, shall be on sheets no larger than 24? by 36? in size, and shall be drawn to a known engineering scale of not smaller than 100 feet to the inch (1? = 100') or a larger scale. In cases of large developments which would exceed the dimensions of the sheet at 100 foot scale, plats may be on multiple sheets or to another known engineering scale, as approved by the city manager/mayor (or designee), and in a format that will be acceptable for eventual filing at Parker County. 
(3)  City staff review. Upon official submission of a complete application for plat approval, the city shall commence technical review of the development proposal by forwarding a copy of the application and plat to development review team members which include, but shall not be limited to, the city manager/mayor, public works director, fire chief/marshal, police chief, building official, and utility director. As noted above, it is the applicant's responsibility to submit one complete copy of any application (including all documents, application forms, plans, etc.) directly to the city planner and city engineer in order for the application to be considered complete. City development review team members shall review the plat and shall ascertain its compliance with these and other applicable city regulations. Following city staff review of the plat and supporting documents, and following discussions with the applicant on any revisions deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements to be installed, the applicant shall resubmit additional copies of the corrected plat (and engineering plans, if applicable) to the city manager/mayor (or designee) and to the city planner and city engineer no later than seven calendar days prior to the board meeting for final review and inclusion in the board packets. Failure to resubmit corrected copies of the plat back to the city in time shall be cause for the city manager/mayor (or designee) to forward the plat application to the board as it was originally submitted rather than the corrected version of the plat. If, upon re-submission of the corrected plat to the city, the city manager/mayor (or designee) determines that the application is still incomplete or is not correct to a reasonable extent, the plat application shall be subject to denial. 
After the plat has been scheduled on an agenda (or at any time prior), the applicant may request, in writing, a waiver of the 30-day approval requirement in order to allow him or her more time to correct deficiencies, address concerns, or otherwise improve the plat pursuant to the city's regulations. After receipt of the request, the city may delay action on the final plat beyond 30 calendar days following the official submission date. 
(4)  Action by the board and city council. All subdivision plat applications (except minor plats and amended plats) shall be reviewed by the board and, if in complete conformance with the provisions of this ordinance and with all other applicable regulations of the city, then they shall be approved by the city council. 
The board shall review each plat application and shall take action to either recommend approval of the plat application or approval of the application subject to certain conditions, or shall vote to deny the plat application, within 30 calendar days following the official submission date unless the applicant has submitted a written waiver of the 30-day review/approval time pursuant to subsection (3) above. The city council shall take action on the plat within 30 calendar days following the board's action to recommend approval of the application (or approval with conditions). Affirmation of, or minor modifications to, the board's recommendation to approve the plat shall require a simple majority vote of the city council members present and voting. 
If the board votes to disapprove (i.e., deny) a plat application, the board shall state such disapproval and the reasons therefore. The applicant or property owner may appeal such decision to the city council by filing a notice of appeal in the office of the city manager/mayor (or designee) no later than ten calendar days after the date upon which the board denied the application. The notice of appeal shall set forth in clear and concise fashion the basis for the appeal. The city council shall consider the appeal at a public meeting no later than 30 calendar days after the date upon which the notice of appeal was filed. The city council may change the decision of the board by vote of a supermajority (i.e., 3/4) of the council members present and voting. The city council may also, where appropriate, remand the plat application back to the board for reconsideration if it believes that there is a compelling reason to do so, such as the introduction of significant new facts or testimony, in which case the board shall re-review the application, including such new facts or testimony, at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(f)  Simultaneous submission of plats. In the event that an applicant submits preliminary and final plat applications simultaneously, as provided in section 11-2-4(c), the city manager/mayor (or designee) shall schedule both plat applications for action by the board within 30 calendar days following the official submission date, unless the applicant has executed a written waiver of the 30-day review period for one or both plats. If the preliminary plat has not received a favorable recommendation by the board prior to consideration of the final plat by the board, then the board shall have no choice but to deny the final plat application (unless withdrawn by the applicant) and such denial shall be final unless appealed to the city council (see above). The city council shall take action on either one or both plat applications, as applicable, within 30 calendar days following the board's action. Affirmation of, or minor modifications to, the board's recommendation to approve the plat(s) shall require a simple majority vote of the city council members present and voting. 
(g)  Proof of land ownership. The city requires proof of land ownership prior to approval of any development application involving real property. Along with the application submission, the applicant shall provide written verification, such as a notarized statement or a power of attorney or other evidence satisfactory to the city manager/mayor (or designee), that he or she is the owner of record of the subject land parcel or parcels, or is the property owner's authorized agent. The city manager/mayor (or designee) shall have the authority to determine what document(s) the city will require to prove ownership, such as one of the following: 
(1)  General warranty deed; 
(2)  Special warranty deed; 
(3)  Title policy; or 
(4)  Some other documentation that is acceptable to the city manager/mayor (or designee). 
If ownership cannot be conclusively established prior to the meeting date on which the development application will be heard, the city shall have the authority to deny the application on the basis of protecting the public interest. The applicant may resubmit a new development application, including the submission fees, for the property at any time following such denial. 
One copy of the proof of land ownership document(s) shall be simultaneously submitted to the city planner in order for the application to be deemed complete. 
(h)  Lapse of plat approval. Unless extended or reinstated pursuant to subsection (i), an approved plat application shall expire and shall thereafter be deemed null and void in accordance with the following rules. Upon expiration, or upon denial of a timely submitted request for extension or reinstatement of plat approval, a new plat application shall be submitted, subject to requirements in effect at the time the application is filed with the city, as determined in accordance with section 11-2-1. 
(1)  Master plat. An approved master plat shall expire if a complete application for a preliminary plat for the first phase of the development has not been filed within 183 days of the date of approval of the master plat by the council, or within the time provided by a phasing schedule approved for the master plat. If the preliminary plat is subsequently denied, the master plat shall thereupon expire. Within 183 days of approval of the preliminary plat for the first phase of the development, or within such other period as may be provided in an approved phasing schedule, a complete application for a preliminary plat must be filed for the next phase of the development, continuing with each successive phase until preliminary plats have been approved for all the land subject to the master plat in accordance with this section or an approved phasing schedule. If the subdivider fails to submit a complete application for a preliminary plat for any phase of the development within the prescribed period, or if the preliminary plat application subsequently is denied for such phase, the master plat shall expire for that phase and for all other phases for which a preliminary plat or final plat has not been approved or no longer remains in effect. If an approved preliminary plat subsequently expires, the master plat for that phase shall expire, and for all other phases for which a preliminary plat or final has not been approved or is not pending for approval, or has lapsed subsequent to approval. 
(2)  Preliminary plat. An approved preliminary plat, for which the city has granted the request of the subdivider to delay construction of improvements until after approval of the final plat pursuant to section 11-2-5(f), shall expire if a complete application for a final plat has not been filed within 183 calendar days of the date of approval of the preliminary plat by the council, or in the event the final plat application subsequently is denied. In all other cases, the preliminary plat shall expire 183 calendar days after the date of approval by the council if the construction of improvements has not commenced within such period, or if the improvements have not been accepted within two years of such approval date. 
(3)  Final plat. An approved final plat shall expire 30 calendar days from the date of approval by the council if the subdivider has failed to submit a complete set of documents for filing the plat within such period, as prescribed by section 11-2-5(i). 
(i)  Extension and reinstatement procedure. Prior to the lapse of approval for a plat, the property owner may petition the city to extend the plat approval. Such petition shall be considered at a public meeting before the board, which shall recommend approval or denial of the petition. The petition shall then be considered by the city council at its next regularly scheduled meeting (if possible), and an extension may be granted by city council at such meeting. If no petition for extension of plat approval is submitted by the property owner prior to the expiration date, then the plat shall be deemed to have expired and shall become null and void. 
    In considering whether to grant a request for extension, the board, and ultimately city council, shall take into account the reasons for lapse, the ability of the property owner to comply with any conditions attached to the original approval, and the extent to which newly adopted subdivision regulations would apply to the plat at that point in time. The city council shall either extend the plat (either with or without conditions) or shall deny the request, in which instance the originally approved plat shall be deemed to be null and void. The property owner must thereafter submit a new plat application for approval, and shall conform to the subdivision regulations then in effect. 
    The city council may extend the plat approval subject to additional conditions based upon newly enacted city regulations or state legislation, or such as are necessary to ensure compliance with the original conditions of approval or to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The city council may also specify a shorter time for extension of the plat than the original 183-day approval period. 
(j)  Lapse of approval of engineering plans. The approved engineering plans shall be valid for a period of 365 calendar days following approval by the city engineer. The city council may, upon written request by the applicant, grant an extension of up to an additional 365 calendar days, after which the engineering plans shall be subject to re-approval by the city engineer if no construction has occurred. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  2.2, 9-10-02; Ord. No. 168-2005-48,  2, 8-9-05) 
Sec. 11-2-3. - Master plat procedures. 
(a)  Purpose and effect. The purpose of a master plat shall be to delineate the sequence and timing of development within a proposed subdivision, where the tract to be developed will be developed in phases or is part of a larger parcel of land owned by the applicant, in order to determine compliance with the comprehensive plan and the availability and capacity of public improvements needed to serve the development. Approval of a master plat authorizes the applicant to submit an application for approval of a preliminary plat. 
(b)  Applicability. A master plat shall be required for any division of land where proposed development of the tract is to occur in phases, or for land inside city limits, where the land is located within an existing or proposed PD Planned Development District. A master plat may not be accepted for filing and any application that conflicts with the limitations of this section shall be deemed incomplete, if the land subject to the master plat exceeds 250 acres for single-family residential developments, or 100 acres for other types of developments. A phasing schedule for the master plat shall not be for more than five years. The limitations on acreage and phasing schedule do not apply where the proposed acreage or phasing schedule for the master plat is in conformity with an approved planned development. If the land subject to the master plat is part of a larger parcel, the remaining land shall be shown as a remainder tract, but shall not be included within the master plat. 
(c)  Remainder tract. A remainder tract is that portion of a larger parcel that is not included within the boundaries of a subdivision plat. Remainder tracts shall not be considered lots or tracts of the subdivision. Approval of a subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of development on a remainder tract. The city may require that information be submitted for a remainder tract with a master plat application solely for the purpose of determining whether the planned public facilities and improvements proposed to serve the master plat will be adequate. Information concerning remainder tracts may be considered in formulating conditions to approval of the master plat application. Based upon such information, the city may require that additional or less land be included in the subdivision plat in order to satisfy the standards applicable to the plat application. If the master plat is approved, a plat application for a remainder tract shall not be accepted for filing and any application that conflicts with the limitations of this section shall be deemed incomplete until a final plat has been approved for the first phase of the master plat. 
(d)  Application. An application for a master plat shall be submitted to the planning director, together with 15 copies of the master plat drawn at a scale of not more than 400 feet to the inch. If more detailed contour information is not available, the USGS map contours may be used for concept planning purposes in most cases. The application for the master plat shall include the following information: 
(1)  Names and addressed of the subdividers, record owner, land planner, engineer and/or surveyor. 
(2)  Proposed name of the subdivision. 
(3)  Location in relation to the rest of the city and boundaries of proposed subdivision. 
(4)  A schematic layout of the entire tract to be subdivided, any remainder tracts and its relationship to adjacent property and existing adjoining developments. 
(5)  Proposed major categories of land use showing existing and proposed zoning. 
(6)  Proposed number of dwelling units and population densities. 
(7)  Proposed and existing arterials and collector streets to serve the land to be platted consistent with the thoroughfare plan or proposed amendments. 
(8)  Location of proposed sites for parks, schools and other public uses as consistent with those shown in the comprehensive plan. 
(9)  Significant natural drainage features including drainage courses and wooded areas, as delineated on USGS topographic maps or on any other topographic maps showing equivalent information. 
(10)  Significant manmade features such as railroad, roads, buildings, utilities or other physical structures as shown on USGS topographic maps, utility company records and city records when such features affect the plan. 
(11)  Proposed dedication of land or rights of way for and construction of public improvements, whether on site or off site, intended to serve each proposed phase of the subdivision. 
(12)  Designation of each phase of development within the subdivision, the order of development, and a schedule for the development of each phase of the master plat. 
(13)  A detailed statement of how the proposed subdivision will be served by water, wastewater, roadway and drainage facilities that have adequate capacity to serve the development. 
(e)  Procedures. 
(1)  Planning and zoning board action. After review of the master plat application by the director and the city engineer, the application shall be scheduled for consideration by the planning and zoning board. The board shall decide whether to approve, approve with conditions or deny the master plat application based on the criteria for approval in subsection (f). 
(2)  City council action. Following decision by the planning and zoning board, the city council shall determine whether to approve, approve with conditions or deny the master plat application, taking into consideration the action taken by the board, and the criteria for approval in subsection (f). 
(3)  Conditions. The commission or the council may impose such conditions to the approval of the master plat application as are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with the criteria in subsection (f). Such conditions may address but are not limited to matters involving conformity with the city's zoning regulations, the availability and capacity of public improvements, or the phasing of development. In addition to other conditions, approval of the master plat may be conditioned on exclusion of land from the master plat or adjustments in the proposed sequence or timing in the proposed phases of the development. 
(f)  Criteria for approval. The following criteria shall be used to determine whether the application for a master plat shall be approved, approved with conditions, or denied: 
(1)  The master plat is consistent with all existing or proposed zoning requirements for the property, including any development plans for a PD Planned Development District and standards of any applicable overlay district, and any approved development or annexation agreements. 
(2)  The proposed provision and configuration of roads, water, wastewater, drainage and park facilities generally conforms to the city's master facilities plans for such facilities. 
(3)  The water, wastewater, roadway and drainage systems serving the development have adequate capacity to accommodate the demands for services created by each phase of the development by the time of final plat approval. 
(4)  The schedule of development is feasible and prudent, and assures that the proposed development will progress to completion within the time limits proposed. 
(5)  The location, size and sequence of the phases of development proposed assure orderly and efficient development of the land subject to the plat. Each phase of the development shall contain the minimum number of dwelling units or quantity of nonresidential use to assure that such standard is met. 
(6)  Where the proposed development is located in whole in part in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city and is subject to an interlocal agreement under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ch. 242, the proposed master plat meets any county standards to be applied pursuant to the agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  2.3, 9-10-02; Ord. No. 168-2005-48,  3, 8-9-05) 
Sec. 11-2-4. - Procedures and submission requirements for preliminary plat approval. 
(a)  Following the pre-application conference (as described in section 11-2-1 above) regarding the overall general development strategy for the property, the applicant shall have prepared a preliminary plat together with full engineering plans for the construction of the subdivision and all associated public improvements and other supplementary materials, as required by this ordinance or by the city. 
(b)  The preliminary plat shall constitute only that portion of the approved concept plan, if there is one, which the applicant proposes to construct and record provided, however, that such portion conforms to all the requirements of this ordinance and with any other applicable regulations and codes of the city. 
(c)  A preliminary plat, if not preceded by an approved concept plan showing phasing of the overall development, shall include all contiguous property under the ownership or control of the applicant unless otherwise approved by the city manager/mayor (or designee) and the city planner. It may contain more than one phase that shall be clearly identified. 
(d)  The applicant may choose to submit a final plat for review concurrently with the preliminary plat. In such case, the city may schedule concurrent review of both plats, provided that all required information and other items are submitted for both plats, including full engineering plans and the appropriate assurances for the completion of all improvements, as per article VI, and provided that adequate review can be achieved by the city. If the city, due to staff resources or other factors, cannot complete its review of both plats, and other associated materials, prior to the applicable planning and zoning board meeting, then only the preliminary plat shall be considered for approval and the final plat shall be denied unless the 30-day review requirement is waived in writing by the applicant. 
(e)  Approval of a preliminary plat by the city council shall be deemed general approval of the street and lot layout shown on the preliminary plat (approval for construction of the necessary streets, water lines, sewer lines, and other required improvements and utilities shall be authorized only through the city engineer's approval of the engineering plans). Except as provided for herein, approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute conditional approval of the final plat when all conditions of approval and when all procedural requirements set forth in this ordinance have been met, and when construction of all improvements (or surety provided) are satisfactorily completed. 
(f)  Standards for approval. No preliminary plat shall be recommended for approval by the board or approved by the city council unless the following standards have been met: 
(1)  The plat substantially conforms with the approved concept plan, if there is one, and with other studies and plans, as applicable; 
(2)  The layouts and engineering plans for required public improvements and city utilities have been submitted by the applicant for approval by the city engineer (whether specifically stated or not, preliminary plat approval shall always be subject to any additions or alterations to the engineering plans as deemed necessary by the city engineer, as needed, to ensure the safe, efficient and proper construction of public improvements within the subdivision); and 
(3)  The plat conforms to applicable zoning and other city regulations. 
(g)  No construction work shall begin on the proposed improvements in the proposed subdivision prior to approval of the preliminary plat by the city council, nor prior to issuance of all appropriate construction permits by the city and other appropriate entities or agencies. No excavation, grading, tree removal or site clearing activities shall occur prior to approval of the preliminary plat and the engineering plans. However, preliminary grading or site preparation activities, such as limited excavation, filling, and removal or clearing of brush, undergrowth or man-induced debris, may be authorized by the city manager/mayor (or designee), at his or her discretion, if such request is submitted in writing by the property owner or developer, if such activities are in conformance with all applicable city ordinances and codes, and if such activities will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare. 
(h)  The applicant shall provide copies of letters from applicable local utility companies stating that each utility company has reviewed the preliminary plat and stating any requirements, including easements, they may have. This requirement may be deferred until the final plat is submitted if such deferral request is submitted to the city in writing and approved by the city manager/mayor (or designee) prior to the board meeting at which the preliminary plat will be considered. 
(i)  Information required upon or with preliminary plat. The proposed preliminary plat and associated engineering plans shall show the following information (the preliminary plat itself shall only include those items marked by italics -other physical and engineering data shall be included in the engineering plans or as separate documents): 
(1)  A vicinity, or location, map that shows the location of the proposed preliminary plat within the city (or within its ETJ) and in relationship to existing roadways ;

(5)  Visibility, access and maintenance easements (to be used if applicable): 
The area or areas shown on the plat as "VAM" (visibility, access and maintenance) easement(s) are hereby given and granted to the city, its successors and assigns, as an easement to provide visibility, right of access for maintenance upon and across said VAM easement. The city shall have the right but not the obligation to maintain any and all landscaping within the VAM easement. Should the city exercise this maintenance right, then it shall be permitted to remove and dispose of any and all landscaping improvements, including without limitation, any trees, shrubs, flowers, ground cover and fixtures. The city may withdraw maintenance of the VAM easement at any time. The ultimate maintenance responsibility for the VAM easement shall rest with the owners. No building, fence, shrub, tree or other improvements or growths, which in any way may endanger or interfere with the visibility, shall be constructed in, on, over or across the VAM easement. The city shall also have the right but not the obligation to add any landscape improvements to the VAM easement, to erect any traffic control devices or signs on the VAM easement and to remove any obstruction thereon. The city, its successors, assigns, or agents shall have the right and privilege at all times to enter upon the VAM easement or any part thereof for the purposes and with all rights and privileges set forth herein. 
(6)  Fire lanes (to be used if applicable): 
That the undersigned does hereby covenant and agree that he (they) shall construct upon the fire lane easements, as dedicated and shown hereon, a hard surface in accordance with the City of Weatherford's paving standards for fire lanes, and that he (they) shall maintain the same in a state of good repair at all times and keep the same free and clear of any structures, fences, trees, shrubs, or other improvements or obstruction, including but not limited to the parking of motor vehicles, trailers, boats or other impediments to the accessibility of fire apparatus. The maintenance of paving on the fire lane easements is the responsibility of the owner, and the owner shall post and maintain appropriate signs in conspicuous places along such fire lanes, stating "Fire Lane, No Parking." The local law enforcement agency(s) is hereby authorized to enforce parking regulations within the fire lanes, and to cause such fire lanes and utility easements to be maintained free and unobstructed at all times for fire department and emergency use. 
(7)  Access easements (to be used if applicable): the undersigned does covenant and agree that the access easement may be utilized by any person or the general public for ingress and egress to other real property, and for the purpose of general public vehicular and pedestrian use and access, and for fire department and emergency use in, along, upon and across said premises, with the right and privilege at all times of the City of Weatherford, its agents, employees, workmen and representatives having ingress, egress, and regress in, along, upon and across said premises. 
(8)  Other plat language. The plat shall include any other applicable language, such as for drainage, floodway or other special types of easements, or such as for a private street subdivision, as deemed appropriate and necessary by the city for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Applicable plat languages are available upon request at the city. 
(j)  Copies of letters from applicable local utility companies stating that each utility company has reviewed the preliminary plat and stating any requirements, including easements, they may have. This requirement may be deferred until the final plat is submitted if such deferral request is submitted to the city in writing and approved by the city manager/mayor (or designee) prior to the board meeting at which the preliminary plat will be considered. 
(k)  Engineering plans. Along with the preliminary plat application, the applicant shall submit five number of sets of the complete engineering plans for all streets, alleys (if any), storm sewers and drainage structures, water and sanitary sewer facilities, screening and retaining walls, landscaping and irrigation, and any other required public improvements for the area covered by the preliminary plat. The engineering plans shall also contain any plans deemed necessary to show or document compliance with the city's ordinances pertaining to nonpoint source pollution control, and any other applicable codes and ordinances of the city that are related to development of a land parcel. Cost estimates for the completion of all public improvements shall also be submitted with the engineering plans for review (and approval, if necessary) by the city's engineer. For the purposes of this ordinance, complete sets of engineering plans shall include the following plans or sheets (generally in this order), as well as any additional plans or sheets deemed necessary and requested by the city engineer: 
- Cover or title sheet (with list of all plans) 
- Preliminary plat 
- Final site plan (for nonresidential and multi-family projects only - see the Zoning Ordinance for specific requirements and approval procedures) 
- Existing conditions plan (unless these items are shown on the preliminary plat itself), which shows existing topography, vegetation, tree inventory, existing natural and manmade physical features, etc. 
- Existing tree and vegetation protection plan 
- Grading, erosion control, and water quality control plans (including a SWPPP) 
- Paving and storm drainage plans 
- Utility plans for water, sanitary sewer, etc. 
- Traffic control plans (if necessary) 
- Screening and retaining wall plans 
- Landscaping and irrigation plans 
    The applicant shall have these plans prepared by their own professional engineer(s), subject to approval of the plans by the city engineer. The city engineer (or designee) shall review, or cause to be reviewed, the plans and specifications and, if approved, shall mark them "Approved" and shall return one set to the applicant, and at least two sets shall be retained in the city's files. If not approved, then one set shall be marked with the objections noted (on the plans themselves and/or in memo format, a copy of which shall also be sent to the city) and returned to the applicant for correction, whereupon the applicant's engineer shall correct the plans as requested and shall resubmit them back to the city engineer for re-review. Once the engineering plans are approved by the city engineer (as documented by an approval memo addressed to the applicant and copied to the city), the property owner shall provide additional sets of the approved plans to the city, as specified by the city engineer, for use during construction. A full set of the city-approved and stamped engineering plans must be available for inspection on the job site at all times. 
    After approval of the preliminary plat by the city council, approval of the engineering plans and specifications by the city engineer, and following procurement of all applicable permits from other appropriate agencies (such as TxDOT, TNRCC, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and/or Parker County), the applicant shall cause a contractor(s) to install or construct the public improvements in accordance with the approved plans and the city's standard specifications, and at the applicant's expense (also see article VI). The applicant shall employ engineers, surveyors or other professionals as necessary to design, stake, supervise, perform and complete the construction of such improvements, and shall cause his or her contractor to construct the said improvements in accordance with this ordinance and with the city's, and any other applicable agency's, design standards. 
    Engineering plans shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer licensed in the State of Texas, as required by state law governing such professions and in accordance with this ordinance and the City's Technical Construction Standards and Specifications (TCSS). All engineering plans submitted for city review shall be dated and shall bear the responsible engineer's registration number, his or her designation of "professional engineer" or "P.E.", and the engineer's seal. Engineering plans shall be approved by the city engineer only when such plans meet all of the requirements of this ordinance and the TCSS. 
    Engineering plans shall be in conformance with the Technical Construction Standards and Specifications (TCSS) and with the requirements set forth herein. Engineering plans (in complete sets, as described above) showing paving and design details of streets, alleys, culverts, bridges, storm sewers, water mains, sanitary sewers, sidewalks, screening and retaining walls, landscape and irrigation plans (if appropriate), and other engineering details of the proposed subdivision at a scale of one inch equals 40 or 50 feet (1? = 40' or 50') horizontally and one inch equals 4, 5, or 10 feet (1? = 4', 5' or 10') vertically shall be submitted to the city engineer (or designee) along with a copy of the preliminary plat of the subdivision. The number of copies as specified by the city shall be submitted along with the preliminary plat submittal. 
    As part of the engineering plans, a drainage plan showing how the drainage of each lot relates to the overall drainage plan for the plat under consideration shall be submitted. The drainage plan shall be made available to each builder within the proposed subdivision and all builders shall comply with the drainage plan. 
    Any adjustments or amendments to the approved engineering plans, as may be required from time-to-time as actual construction commences, may be made after prior approval of the city. Any such amendments shall require the submission of revised engineering plans which shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer licensed in the State of Texas, as required by state law governing such professions and in accordance with this ordinance and the City's Technical Construction Standards and Specifications (TCSS). All engineering plans submitted for city review shall be dated and shall bear the responsible engineer's registration number, his or her designation of "professional engineer" or "P.E.", and the engineer's seal. 
(l)  Effect of approval. Approval of a preliminary plat authorizes the property owner, upon fulfillment of all requirements and conditions of approval and upon construction of all required improvements (or submission of the proper assurances for construction of same, per article VI), to submit an application for final plat approval (see section 11-2-5). 
(m)  Revisions to approved preliminary plat. It is generally recognized that minor revisions to the preliminary plat will probably be needed before the final plat can be filed at the county. Such minor revisions as slight enlargement or shifting of easements or lot lines, addition of private or franchise utility easements, correction of bearings or distances, correction of minor labeling errors, addition of erroneously omitted informational items and labels, etc. may occur on the final plat without having to re-approve the preliminary plat. Determination of whether or not revisions are "minor" in nature is subject to the judgment of the city's planner and engineer. Major revisions, such as obvious reconfiguration of lot lines or easements, relocation of driveways or access easements or fire lanes, any modification to the perimeter or boundary of the property, and relocation or addition or deletion of any public improvement (including corresponding easement), shall necessitate re-submission and re-approval of the plat as a "revised preliminary plat" unless otherwise approved by the city planner and the city engineer, as applicable. The procedures for such re-approval shall be the same as for a preliminary plat, and such re-approval may constitute a new project thus necessitating submission of a new application form, payment of new fees, compliance with amendments to this ordinance which occurred since original preliminary plat approval, and other requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  2.4, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-2-5. - Procedures and submission requirements for final plat approval. 
(a)  The final plat shall be in accordance with the preliminary plat, as approved, and shall incorporate all applicable conditions, changes, directions and additions imposed by the planning and zoning board and city council upon the preliminary plat. The final plat shall not be recommended for approval by the planning and zoning board, nor approved by the city council, until all utilities, infrastructure, and other required improvements have been constructed according to the engineering plans, and have passed a final inspection and been approved by the city engineer, unless provisions are made for the completion of the improvements in accordance with article VI. The final plat shall not be submitted prior to approval of the preliminary plat (see section 11-2-4[(c)] for exception). 
(b)  Final plat applications which do not include the required data, completed application form, submission fee, number of copies of the plat, record drawings, "letter of satisfactory completion" (of the public improvements) from the city, and other required information, including documentation that all required public improvements have been constructed and installed in accordance with city standards, letters from utility companies verifying their easements, and submission of the proper assurances or escrow funds for the completion of the improvements (per article VI) will be considered incomplete, shall not be accepted for submission by the city, and shall not be scheduled on a planning and zoning board or city council agenda until the proper information is provided to city staff. 
(c)  Information required on a final plat. 
(1)  All information that is required for a preliminary plat (see section 11-2-4[(i)]), except for submission of engineering plans, provided that such plans were already submitted and approved with the preliminary plat; and except that physical features of or on the land (such as topography, buildings, utility structures, water bodies and tree cover) shall not be shown on the final plat. In addition to these items, the final plat shall also provide a place for the County Clerk of Parker County to stamp the date and location where the plat will be filed ("Volume or Cabinet ___, Page or Slide ___") in the lower right-hand corner of all sheets of the plat drawing near the title block. 
(2)  All aspects of the final plat shall conform to the standards of Parker County for plats with respect to clarity, sheet size, lettering size and reproducibility, and the county's formatting requirements for same shall control if different from this ordinance. It is the applicant's responsibility to be familiar with the county's standards for filing plats and to comply with same. 
(3)  Approval block (required). The approval block used on the previously approved preliminary plat shall be modified and shown on the final plat, as follows: 
FINAL PLAT 
Approved by the City of Weatherford for filing at the office of the County Clerk of Parker County, Texas. 
RECOMMENDED BY: Planning and Zoning Board 
City of Weatherford, Texas __________Signature of Chairperson       Date of Recommendation APPROVED BY: City Council 
City of Weatherford, Texas __________Signature of Mayor Date of Approval ATTEST: __________City Secretary Date  
(4)  Property Location Statement (if required by Parker County): 
This property is located in the corporate limits [or the extraterritorial jurisdiction] of the City of Weatherford, Parker County, Texas. 
__________Mayor, City of Weatherford Date ATTEST: __________City Secretary, City of Weatherford       Date  
(d)  Standards for approval. No final plat shall be reviewed by the board or approved by the city council unless the following standards have been met: 
(1)  The plat substantially conforms to the approved preliminary plat and other studies and plans, as applicable; 
(2)  The construction and installation of required public improvements and city utilities has been completed and the improvements have been accepted by the city as conforming to the city's regulations and design standards (or the proper assurances for construction of the improvements have been submitted and approved by the city, per article VI); and 
(3)  The plat conforms to applicable zoning, subdivision and any other applicable codes or ordinances of the city that are related to development of a land parcel. 
(e)  When all of the improvements are found to be constructed and completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and with the city's standards, and upon receipt by the City of Weatherford of a maintenance bond or certificate of deposit in accordance with article VI of this ordinance from each contractor, three sealed sets of "as built" (or "record drawing") plans and one sealed set of "as-built" or "record drawing" mylars shall be submitted with a letter stating the contractors' compliance with this ordinance, and bearing sealed certification by the design engineer that all public improvements have been constructed in compliance with all city construction standards set forth in the TCSS and other applicable city design documents. After such letter and certification is received, the city manager/mayor (or designee) shall receive and accept for the City of Weatherford the title, use and maintenance of the improvements according to section 11-6-7. The final plat shall not be approved or filed at the county prior to receipt of the above letter and certification and any other required items, nor prior to acceptance of the improvements by the city. 
(f)  Timing of public improvements. 
(1)  The city council may permit all or some of the public improvements to be installed, offered for dedication, or accepted by the city after approval of the final plat by the city council if there exists a compelling reason that is consistent with the public health, safety or welfare to do so (also see article VI). 
The city council may permit or require the deferral of the construction of public improvements if, in its judgment, deferring the construction would not result in any harm to the public or would offer significant advantage in coordinating the site's development with adjacent properties and offsite public improvements. The deferred construction of any required public improvement(s) must be approved by the city council at the time of preliminary plat approval, and the necessary assurances for completion of the improvements, in accordance with article VI, shall be a stipulation, or condition, of approval of the preliminary or final plat, as appropriate. 
(2)  If the city council does not require that all public improvements be installed, offered for dedication, or accepted by the city prior to approval of the final plat, the applicant shall provide assurances or security for the completion of the improvements or escrowed funds, as provided in article VI. 
(g)  Effect of approval. Approval of a final plat authorizes the property owner, upon fulfillment of all requirements and conditions of approval and upon completion of construction of all required improvements (or submission of the proper assurances for construction of same, per article VI), to submit the final copies, or mylars, of the plat for filing at Parker County. Lots may be sold only when the final plat has been approved by the city council and the plat has been filed at Parker County. No conveyance or sale of any portion or lot of the property may occur until after the final plat is approved by the city council and filed at Parker County. 
(h)  Revisions to approved final plat prior to filing at the county. Occasionally, minor revisions are needed before the final plat can be filed at the county. Such minor revisions as correction of bearings or distances, correction of minor labeling errors, addition of erroneously omitted informational items and labels, etc. may occur on the record plat prior to filing it without the city council having to re-approve the final plat. Determination of whether or not revisions are "minor" in nature is subject to the judgment of the city's planner and engineer. Major revisions, such as obvious corrections or reconfiguration of lot lines or easements, relocation of driveways or access easements or fire lanes, any modification to the perimeter or boundary of the property, and relocation or addition or deletion of any public improvement (including corresponding easement), shall necessitate re-submission and re-approval of the plat as a "revised final plat" unless otherwise approved by the city planner and the city engineer, as applicable. The procedures for such re-approval shall be the same as for a final plat, and such re-approval may constitute a new project thus necessitating submission of a new application form, payment of new fees, compliance with amendments to this ordinance which occurred since original final plat approval, and other requirements. 
(i)  Subsequent to final plat recommendation by the planning and zoning board and subsequent approval by the city council, the applicant shall return copies of the final plat, as approved, along with any other required documents and necessary fees, to the city manager/mayor (or designee) within 30 calendar days following approval, in accordance with requirements established by the city. All easements shall be included on the final plat, including the recording information for those easements that are filed or recorded as separate instruments, as required by utility companies and the City of Weatherford prior to filing the final plat, and a copy of letters from each applicable utility company shall be submitted to the city manager/mayor (or designee), and a copy of same shall be submitted to the city planner and the city engineer, stating that the plat contains the proper easements. All necessary filing materials as required by the County Clerk of Parker County, in addition to the appropriate number of mylar copies and a computer disk containing the digital plat file(s) required by the city manager/mayor (or designee), shall be returned to the city secretary with the required fees. If the required copies and materials are not returned to the city within the specified 30-day time frame, the approval of the final plat shall be null and void unless an extension is granted by the city council. The city secretary shall file the final plat at the Office of the County Clerk of Parker County within 30 calendar days following receipt of all filing materials, including filing fees.

1.  A final plat application for all or part of the land subject to the approved prior plat was approved, or was filed and was subsequently approved, or an application for a final plat was submitted for all or part of the land subject to the approved prior plat, but such application was rejected on grounds of incompleteness; 
2.  Costs for development of the land subject to the prior plat, including but not limited to costs associated with roadway, utility and other infrastructure facilities designed to serve the land in whole or in part, but exclusive of land acquisition costs, were incurred in the aggregate amount of five percent of the most recent appraised market value of the land subject to the prior plat;

(2)  Reinstate the expired prior plat for all or part of the land subject thereto, if it finds that the petitioner has met any one of the criteria listed in subsection (c)(2), subject to such expiration dates or other conditions that assure that the remaining land that is not subject to an approved or pending final plat application will be developed in a timely fashion. In granting relief under this provision, the council may require that development of such remaining land is subject to standards enacted after initial approval of the expired prior plat. 
(3)  Deny the petition, if it finds that the petitioner has failed to meet any of the criteria in subsection (c). 
(4)  Reinstate the prior plat for only that part of the land subject to a pending final plat application, if it finds that the petitioner has met the criteria in subsection (c)(2)b. and the pending plat application subsequently was approved, and deny the petition for the remaining land within the expired prior plat.

(1)  The development of any tract of land which has not been platted or replatted prior to the effective date of this ordinance [Sept. 10, 2002], unless expressly exempted herein; or 
(2)  The development of any tract of land for which the property owner claims an exemption from the city's subdivision ordinance, including requirements to replat, which exemption is not expressly provided for in such regulations; or 
(3)  The development of any tract of land for which the only access is a private easement or street; or 
(4)  The division of any tract of land resulting in parcels or lots each of which is greater than five acres in size, and where no public improvement is proposed to be dedicated or constructed. 
(c)  Exceptions. No development plat shall be required, where the land to be developed has received final plat or replat approval prior to the effective date of this ordinance [Sept. 10, 2002]. The city council may, from time to time, exempt other development or land divisions from the requirements of this section. 
(d)  Prohibition on development. No development shall commence, nor shall any building permit, utility connection permit, electrical connection permit or similar permit be issued, for any development or land division subject to this section, until a development plat has been reviewed by the board, approved by the city council, and submitted to the city for filing at the county. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the city shall not require building permits or otherwise enforce the city's building code in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction in relation to any development plat required by this subdivision ordinance. 
(e)  Standards of approval. The development plat shall not be approved until the following standards have been satisfied: 
(1)  The proposed development conforms to all city plans, including but not limited to, the comprehensive plan, utility plans and applicable capital improvements plans; 
(2)  The proposed development conforms to the requirements of the zoning ordinance (if located within the city's corporate limits) and the subdivision ordinance; 
(3)  The proposed development is adequately served by public facilities and services, parks and open space in conformance with city regulations; 
(4)  Appropriate agreements for acceptance and use of public dedications to serve the development have been tendered; and 
(5)  The proposed development conforms to the design and improvement standards contained in this ordinance and in the city's TCSS, and to any other applicable codes or ordinances of the city that are related to development of a land parcel. 
(f)  Conditions. The city council may impose such conditions on the approval of the development plat as are necessary to assure compliance with the standards in subsection (e) above. 
(g)  Approval procedure. The application for a development plat shall be submitted to the city in the same manner as a final plat (see sections 11-2-5 and 11-2-6), and shall be approved, conditionally approved, or denied by the city council following review and recommendation by the planning and zoning board in a similar manner as a final plat. Upon approval, the development plat shall be filed at the county by the city secretary in the same manner as prescribed for a final plat (see section 11-2-5), and approval of a development plat shall expire if all filing materials are not submitted to the city manager/mayor (or designee) and if the plat is not filed at the county within the time periods specified for a final plat. 
(h)  Submittal requirements. In addition to all information that is required to be shown on a final plat (see section 11-2-6), a development plat shall: 
(1)  Be prepared by a registered professional land surveyor; 
(2)  Clearly show the boundary of the development plat; 
(3)  Show each existing or proposed building, structure or improvement or proposed modification of the external configuration of the building, structure or improvement involving a change therein; 
(4)  Show all easements and rights-of-way within or adjacent to the development plat; and 
(5)  Be accompanied by the required number of copies of the plat, a completed application form, the required submission fee, and a certificate or some other form of verification from the Parker County Central Appraisal District showing that all taxes have been paid on the subject property and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in accordance with section 11-1-10. 
    A copy of all application materials for a development plat shall be simultaneously submitted to the city planner for review in the same manner as for a final plat, or the application shall be deemed incomplete. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  2.7, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-2-8. - Replatting. 
(a)  Replat required. Unless otherwise expressly provided for herein, a property owner who proposes to replat any portion of an already approved and filed final plat, other than to amend or vacate the plat, must first obtain approval for the replat under the same standards and by the same procedures prescribed for the final platting of land by this ordinance. All improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the same requirements as for a preliminary or final plat, as provided herein. The city manager/mayor (or designee) may waive or modify requirements for a preliminary replat under certain circumstances where the proposed replat does not involve a large land parcel or an existing structure or business on the subject property, and where the proposed plat revisions are relatively simple in nature. 
(b)  Replatting without vacating preceding plat. A replat of a final plat or portion of a final plat may be recorded and is controlling over the preceding plat without vacation of that plat if the replat: 
(1)  Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being replatted; 
(2)  Is approved, after a public hearing on the matter at which parties in interest and citizens have an opportunity to be heard, by the planning and zoning board and by the city council; and 
(3)  Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions previously incorporated in the final plat. 
(c)  Previous requirements or conditions of approval which are still valid. In addition to compliance with b. above, a replat without vacation of the preceding plat must conform to the requirements of this section if: 
(1)  During the preceding five years, any of the area to be replatted was limited by an interim or permanent zoning classification to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot; or 
(2)  Any lot in the preceding plat was limited by deed restrictions to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot. 
Notice of the public hearing required under (b) above shall be given before the 15th calendar day before the date of the hearing by publication in an official newspaper or a newspaper of general circulation in Parker County. Notice of the public hearing shall also be given by written notice before the 15th calendar day before the date of the hearing, with a copy or description of any requested waivers/suspensions, sent to the property owners, as documented on the most recently approved ad valorem tax roll of the city, of lots that are in the original subdivision and that are within 200 feet of the lot(s) to be replatted. In the case of a subdivision in the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the most recently approved county tax roll shall be used. The written notice may be delivered by depositing the notice, properly addressed with appropriate postage paid, in a post office or postal depository within the boundaries of the city. 
(d)  If the property owner(s) of 20 percent or more of the total land area of lots to whom notice is required to be given under subsection (b) above file with the city a written protest of the replatting before or at the public hearing, or if the replat requires a waiver/suspension as defined in section 11-1-9, then approval of the replat will require the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the city council members present and voting. For a legal protest, written instruments signed by the owners of at least 20 percent of the total land area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed replat and extending 200 feet from that area, but within the original subdivision, must be filed with the city prior to the close of the public hearing. In computing the percentage of land area subject to the "20 percent rule" described above, the area of streets and alleys shall be included. 
(e)  Compliance with subsection (c) above is not required for approval of a replat for part of a preceding plat if the area to be replatted was designated or reserved for other than single- or two-family (i.e., duplex) residential use by notation on the last legally recorded plat or in the legally recorded restrictions applicable to the plat. For example, for a replat involving nonresidential property, a public hearing must be held, pursuant to subsection (b)(2) above, but notice of the hearing does not have to appear in the newspaper and written notices do not have to be mailed to individual property owners within 200 feet of the subject property. 
(f)  Any replat that adds or deletes lots must include the original subdivision and lot boundaries. If a replat is submitted for only a portion of a previously platted subdivision, the replat must reference the previous subdivision name and recording information, and must state on the replat the specific lots which have changed along with a detailed "purpose for replat" statement. 
(g)  If the previous plat is vacated as prescribed in section 212.013 of the Texas Local Government Code, as amended, and as provided in section 11-2-10 of this ordinance, a public hearing is not required for a replat of the area vacated. It would, instead, be submitted as a "final plat" and reviewed accordingly. 
(h)  The replat of the subdivision shall meet all the requirements for a final plat for a new subdivision that may be pertinent, as provided for herein. 
(i)  The title shall identify the document as a "Final Plat" of the "_______ Addition, Block ___, Lot(s) ___, Being a Replat of Block _______, Lot(s) _______ of the ________ Addition, an addition to the City of Weatherford, Texas, as recorded in Volume/Cabinet _______, Page/Slide _______ of the Plat Records of Parker County, Texas." 
(j)  An application submittal for a replat shall be the same as for a final plat, and shall be accompanied by the required number of copies of the plat, a completed application form, the required submission fee, and a certificate showing that all taxes have been paid on the subject property and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in accordance with section 11-1-10. The replat shall also bear a detailed "purpose for replat" statement which describes exactly what has been changed on the plat since the original (or previous) plat was approved by the city and filed at the county. 
    A copy of all application materials for a replat shall be simultaneously submitted to the city planner for review in the same manner as for a final plat, or the application shall be deemed incomplete. 
(k)  The replat shall be filed at the county in the same manner as prescribed for a final plat, and approval of a replat shall expire if all filing materials are not submitted to the city secretary, and if the replat is not filed at the county within the time periods specified for a final plat. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  2.8, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-2-9. - Amending plats. 
(a)  An amended plat shall meet all of the informational and procedural requirements set forth for a final plat, and shall be accompanied by the required number of copies of the plat, a completed application form, the required submission fee, and a certificate or some other acceptable form of verification from the Parker County Central Appraisal District showing that all taxes have been paid on the subject property and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in accordance with section 11-1-10. 
    A copy of all application materials for an amending plat shall be simultaneously submitted to the city planner for review in the same manner as for a final plat, or the application shall be deemed incomplete. 
(b)  Upon receipt of a favorable recommendation for approval from the city planner, the city manager/mayor (or designee) may approve an amending plat, which may be recorded and is controlling over the preceding or final plat without vacation of that plat, if the amending plat is signed by the applicants only and if the amending plat is for one or more of the purposes set forth in this section. The procedures for amending plats shall apply only if the sole purpose of the amending plat is to: 
(1)  Correct an error in a course or distance shown on the preceding plat; 
(2)  Add a course or distance that was omitted on the preceding plat; 
(3)  Correct an error in a real property description shown on the preceding plat; 
(4)  Indicate monuments set after the death, disability, or retirement from practice of the engineer or surveyor responsible for setting monuments; 
(5)  Show the location or character of a monument that has been changed in location or character or that is shown incorrectly as to location or character on the preceding plat; 
(6)  Correct any other type of scrivener or clerical error or omission previously approved by the municipal authority responsible for approving plats, including lot numbers, acreage, street names, and identification of adjacent recorded plats; 
(7)  Correct an error in courses and distances of lot lines between two adjacent lots if: 
a.  Both lot owners join in the application for amending the plat; 
b.  Neither lot is abolished; 
c.  The amendment does not attempt to remove or modify recorded covenants or restrictions or easements; and 
d.  The amendment does not have a material adverse effect on the property rights of the owners in the plat; 
(8)  Relocate a lot line to eliminate an inadvertent encroachment of a building or other improvement on a lot line or easement; 
(9)  Relocate one or more lot lines between one or more adjacent lots if: 
a.  The owners of all those lots join in the application for amending the plat; 
b.  The amendment does not attempt to remove or modify recorded covenants or restrictions or easements; and 
c.  The amendment does not increase the number of lots; or 
(10)  To make necessary changes to the preceding plat to create six or fewer lots in the subdivision or a part of the subdivision covered by the preceding plat if: 
a.  The changes do not affect applicable zoning and other regulations of the city; 
b.  The amendment does not attempt to remove or modify recorded covenants or restrictions or easements; and 
c.  The area covered by the changes is located in an area that the city council has approved, after a public hearing, as a residential improvement area. 
(c)  The city manager/mayor (or designee) may, at his or her discretion and for any reason, elect to present the amending plat to the planning and zoning board and city council for consideration and approval. Any decision made on the amending plat by the city manager/mayor (or designee) shall be approval of the plat. Should the city manager/mayor (or designee) refuse to approve the amending plat, then the plat shall be referred to the board for review, and the city council for approval, within the time period required by state law. 
(d)  Notice, a public hearing, and the approval of other lot owners are not required for the approval and issuance of an amending plat. 
(e)  The amended plat shall be entitled and clearly state that it is an "amended plat", and it shall include a detailed "purpose for amended plat" statement which describes exactly what has been changed on the plat since the original (or previous) plat was approved by the city and filed at the county. It shall also state the specific lots affected or changed as a result of the amended plat, and shall include the original subdivision plat boundary. All references to "final plat" or "replat" shall be removed. 
(f)  Other than noted above, the procedure for approval of plat amendment(s) shall be the same as in section 11-2-8. 
(g)  The amending plat shall be filed at the county in the same manner as prescribed for a final plat, and approval of an amending plat shall expire if all filing materials are not submitted to the city secretary, and if the plat is not filed at the county within the time periods specified for a final plat. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  2.9, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-2-10. - Plat vacation. 
(a)  By property owner. The property owner of the tract covered by a plat may vacate, upon review by the board and approval by the city council, the plat at any time before any lot in the plat is sold. The plat is vacated when a signed, acknowledged instrument declaring the plat vacated is approved and recorded in the manner prescribed for the original plat (instrument language is available from the city, upon request). 
(b)  By all lot owners. If some or all of the lots covered by the plat have been sold, the plat, or any part of the plat, may be vacated on the application of all the owners of lots in the plat with approval obtained in the manner prescribed for the original plat. 
(c)  Criteria. The planning and zoning board shall review, and the city council may approve, the petition for vacation on such terms and conditions as are in accordance with  212.013 of the Texas Local Government Code (as amended), and as are reasonable to protect the public health, safety and welfare. As a condition of vacation of the plat, the city council may direct the petitioners to prepare and seek approval of a revised final plat in accordance with this ordinance such that the property does not become "unplatted." 
(d)  Effect of action. On the execution and recording of the vacating instrument, the vacated plat shall have no effect. Regardless of the board's and city council's action on the petition, the property owner will have no right to a refund of any monies, fees or charges paid to the city nor to the return of any property or consideration dedicated or delivered to the city except as may have previously been agreed to by the board and city council. 
(e)  City-initiated plat vacation. 
(1)  General conditions. The city council, on its motion and following a public hearing on the matter, may vacate the plat of an approved subdivision or addition when: 
a.  No lots within the approved plat have been sold within five years following the date that the plat was signed by the city; 
b.  The property owner has breached an improvement agreement and the city is unable to obtain funds with which to complete construction of public improvements, except that the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by property owner or its successor; or 
c.  The plat has been of record for more than five years and the city determines that the further sale of lots within the subdivision or addition presents a threat to public health, safety or welfare, except that the vacation shall apply only to lots owned by the property owner or its successors. 
(2)  Procedure. Upon any motion of the planning and zoning board or city council to vacate the plat of any previously approved subdivision or addition, in whole or in part, the city shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county before the 15th day prior to the date of the public hearing at which the plat vacation shall be heard by the board. The city shall also provide written notice to all property owners within the subdivision or addition and to all members of the city council. The notice shall state the time and place for a public hearing before the board, and subsequently before the city council, on the motion to vacate the subdivision or addition plat. The commission shall recommend approval, and the city council shall approve, the plat vacation only if the criteria and conditions cited above are satisfied. 
(3)  Record of notice. If the city council approves vacating a plat, the city secretary shall record a copy of the plat vacation instrument in the office of the County Clerk of Parker County along with an exhibit showing a drawing of the area or plat vacated. The county clerk shall write legibly on the vacated plat the word "vacated" and shall enter on the plat a reference to the volume and page at which the vacating instrument is recorded. If the city council vacates only a portion of a plat, it shall cause a revised final plat drawing to also be recorded that shows that portion of the original plat that has been vacated and that portion that has not been vacated. On the execution and recording of the vacating instrument the vacated plat (or the vacated portion of the plat) has no effect. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  2.10, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-2-11. - Minor plats. 
(a)  A minor plat shall meet all of the informational and procedural requirements set forth for a final plat, and shall be accompanied by the required number of copies of the plat, a completed application form, the required submission fee, and a certificate or some other acceptable form of verification from the Parker County Central Appraisal District showing that all taxes have been paid on the subject property and that no delinquent taxes exist against the property in accordance with section 11-1-10. 
    A copy of all application materials for a minor plat shall be simultaneously submitted to the city planner for review in the same manner as for a final plat, or the application shall be deemed incomplete. 
(b)  Upon receipt of a favorable recommendation for approval by the city planner, the city manager/mayor (or designee) may approve a minor plat, or may, for any reason, elect to present the minor plat to the planning and zoning board and city council for consideration and approval. Any decision made on the minor plat by the city manager/mayor (or designee) shall be approval of the plat. Should the city manager/mayor (or designee) refuse to approve the minor plat, then the plat shall be referred to the planning and zoning board for review, and city council for approval, within the time period required by state law. 
(c)  Notice, a public hearing, and the approval of other lot owners are not required for the approval a minor plat. 
(d)  The minor plat shall be entitled and clearly state that it is a "minor plat." 
(e)  The minor plat shall be filed at the county in the same manner as prescribed for a final plat, and approval of a minor plat shall expire if all filing materials are not submitted to the city and if the plat is not filed at the county within the time periods specified for a final plat. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  2.11, 9-10-02) 
ARTICLE III. - SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 11-3-0. - Proportionality appeal. 
(a)  Purpose, applicability and effect. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of a proportionality appeal is to assure that a requirement to dedicate, construct or pay a fee for a public infrastructure improvement imposed on a proposed plat as a condition of approval does not result in a disproportionate cost burden on the property owner, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed development on the city's public facilities systems. 
(2)  Applicability. An appeal under this section may be filed by a property owner to contest any requirements to dedicate land, to construct improvements or to pay development fees, other than impact fees, for a public infrastructure improvement, which requirement is imposed under the city's subdivision regulations to a plat application pursuant to this chapter, whether the requirement is applicable under uniform standards, or is imposed pursuant to an individual evaluation of the proposed subdivision. 
(b)  Proportionality determination by city engineer. Prior to a decision by the planning and zoning board on a preliminary plat application, or if no preliminary plat application is required, on a final plat application, filed under this chapter, the city engineer shall prepare a report affirming that each public infrastructure improvement to be imposed as a condition of plat approval is roughly proportionate to the demand created by the development on the city's public facilities systems, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed. 
(1)  In making his proportionality determination, the city engineer may rely upon categorical findings pertaining to onsite improvements, including minimum infrastructure sizes specified in the city's TCSS manual; the proposed or potential use of the land; the timing and sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities; impact fee studies or other studies that measure the demand for services created by the development and the impact on the city's public facilities systems; the function of the public infrastructure improvements in serving the proposed development; the degree to which public infrastructure improvements to serve the subdivision are supplied by other developments; the anticipated participation by the city in the costs of such improvements; any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure improvements for which the proposed development is eligible; or any other information relating to the mitigating effects of the public infrastructure improvements on the impacts created by the development on the city's public facilities systems. 
(2)  Based upon his proportionality determination, the city engineer shall affirm that the public infrastructure improvement requirements of the subdivision regulations do not impose costs on the developer for such improvements that exceed those roughly proportionate to those incurred by the city in providing public facilities to serve the development. 
(3)  The city engineer may promulgate any application requirements that may assist in making the proportionality determination required by this subsection. 
(c)  Board determination. The city planning and zoning board shall take into account the city's engineer's report concerning the proportionality of public infrastructure improvement requirements to be applied to a proposed preliminary or final plat application, as the case may be, in making its decision on the plat application, and shall identify any variation to the requirements that are to be included as conditions to plat approval. 
(d)  Appeals. 
(1)  Who may appeal. An appeal to the city council or municipal utility board under this section may be filed by a property owner or the applicant for a preliminary or final plat, in which a requirement to dedicate land for, construct or pay a fee, other than an impact fee, for a public infrastructure improvement has been applied or attached as a condition of approval, or as grounds for denying the plat application. 
(2)  Time for filing and request for extension of time. The appeal shall be filed in writing within ten days of the date the planning and zoning board takes action applying the public infrastructure improvement requirement to the plat application. The appeal shall be filed with the city secretary and shall be forwarded to the city council or municipal utility board for consideration in conjunction with its deliberations on the plat application. The applicant may request postponements of consideration of the plat application by the city council pending preparation of the study required by subsection (4), in which case the applicant shall also waive the statutory period for deciding plats for the time needed to decide the appeal by the city council. 
(3)  Form of appeal. An appeal under this section shall allege that application of the standard or the imposition of conditions relating to the dedication, construction or fee requirements in not roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed development on the city's public facilities system, or does not reasonably benefit the proposed development. 
(4)  Study required. The appellant shall provide a study utilizing the city's design criteria in support of the appeal that includes the following information within 30 days of the date of appeal, unless a longer time is requested: 
a.  Total capacity of the city's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park system to be utilized by the proposed development, employing standard measures of capacity and equivalency tables relating the type of development proposed to the quality of system capacity to be consumed by the development. If the proposed development is to be developed in phases, such information also shall be provided for entire development proposed, including any phases already developed. The appellant shall provide sufficient information to show phasing of infrastructure, in conjunction with phasing of the proposed development, does not have adverse impact to the city's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park system. 
b.  Total capacity to be supplied to the city's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park facilities system by the dedication of an interest in land, of improvements or fee contribution. If the plat application is proposed as a phased development, the information shall include any capacity supplied by prior dedication, construction or fee payments. 
c.  Comparison of the capacity of the city's public facilities system(s) to be consumed by the proposed development with the capacity to be supplied to such system(s) by the proposed dedication of an interest in land, construction of improvements, or fee payment. In making this comparison, the impacts on the city's public facilities system(s) from the entire development shall be considered. 
d.  The amount of any city participation in the costs of oversizing the public infrastructure improvement to be constructed in accordance with the city's requirements. 
e.  Any other information that shows the alleged disproportionality between the impacts created by the proposed development and the dedication, construction or fee requirement imposed by the city. 
(e)  Land in extraterritorial jurisdiction. Where the subdivision or the public infrastructure improvements are located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city and are to be dedicated to a county under an interlocal agreement under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 242. An appeal or study in support of the appeal shall not be accepted as complete for filing by the planning and zoning administration unless, an appeal or study is accompanied by verification that a copy has been delivered to the county in which the facilities are to be located. 
(f)  Processing application. 
(1)  Responsible official. The city engineer is the responsible official for evaluation and processing of an appeal under this section. Where the appeal is for relief from dedication of rights-of-way for or construction of a facility in the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction that is to be dedicated to a county under an interlocal agreement under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 242, the city engineer shall coordinate a recommendation with the county responsible for reviewing plats in the county. 
(2)  Evaluation; recommendation. The city engineer shall evaluate the appeal and supporting study and shall make a recommendation to the city council or municipal utility board based upon the information contained in the study, any comments received from the county, and the city engineer's analysis based upon the same factors considered in making his original proportionality determination. 
(g)  Decision. The city council or municipal utility board shall decide the appeal in conjunction with its decision on the plat application. The council or board shall base its decision on the criteria listed in subsection (i), and may take one of the following actions. 
(1)  Deny the appeal, and impose the standard or condition on the plat application in accordance with the city engineer's recommendation or the planning and zoning board's decision on the plat; or 
(2)  Deny the appeal, upon finding that the proposed dedication, construction or fee requirements are inadequate to offset the impacts of the subdivision on the public facilities system for water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park improvements, and either deny the plat application or require that additional public infrastructure improvements be made as a condition of approval of the application; or 
(3)  Grant the appeal, and waive in whole or in part any dedication, construction or fee requirement for public infrastructure improvements to the extent necessary to achieve proportionality; or 
(4)  Grant the appeal, and direct that the city participate in the costs of acquiring land for or constructing the public infrastructure improvement under standard participation policies. 
(h)  Criteria for approval. In deciding an appeal under this section, the city council or municipal utility board shall determine whether the application of the standard or condition requiring dedication of an interest in land for, construction of, or payment of a fee for public infrastructure improvements is roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed subdivision on the city's public facilities systems for water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park facilities, and reasonably benefits the development. In making such determination, the council or board shall consider the evidence submitted by the appellant, the city engineer's report and recommendation, considering in particular the factors identified in subsection (c), and, where the property is located within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, any recommendations from the county. 
(i)  Action following decision. If the relief requested under the proportionality appeal is granted in whole or in part by the city council or municipal utility board, the dedication, construction or fee requirement initially imposed by the planning and zoning board as a condition of plat approval shall be modified accordingly, and the standards applied or the conditions attached to board's approval of the plat application shall be conformed to the relief granted. Thereafter, the appellant shall resubmit the plat application to the city council within 90 days of the date relief under the appeal is granted, in whole or in part, showing conformity with the city council's or municipal utility board's decision on the appeal. 
(j)  Expiration of relief. If an applicant for plat approval prevails on a proportionality appeal, but fails to conform the plat to the relief granted by the city council or municipal utility board with the 90-day period provided, the relief granted by the city council or municipal utility board on the appeal shall expire. 
(1)  The council may extend the time for filing the revised plat application for good cause shown, but in any event, the expiration date for the relief granted shall not be extended beyond one year from the date relief was granted on the appeal. 
(2)  If the plat application is modified to increase the number of residential units or the intensity of nonresidential uses, a new petition for relief shall be required. 
(3)  If the plat application for which relief was granted is denied on other grounds, a new petition for relief shall be required on any subsequent application.

Sec. 11-3-1. - Streets. 
(a)  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the City of Weatherford's Thoroughfare Plan and TCSS, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets or driveways (whether within the City of Weatherford, within its ETJ area, or within adjacent municipal or county areas), to topographical conditions, to public safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. Reserve or residual strips of land controlling access to or egress from other property, or to or from any street or alley, or having the effect of restricting or damaging the adjoining property for subdivision purposes, or which will not be taxable or accessible for improvements shall not be permitted in any subdivision unless such are required by the city in the public interest (such as to enhance public safety or other public interest). All streets shall be constructed in accordance with article V and with the city's TCSS. 
(b)  Proposed streets shall provide a safe, convenient and functional system for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, shall be properly related to the thoroughfare plan and any amendments thereto, and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of each proposed subdivision or development. All streets shall be open and unobstructed at all times. The layout of the street network shall, to the greatest extent possible, be sited and aligned along natural contour lines, and shall minimize the amount of cut and fill on slopes in order to minimize the amount of land area that is disturbed during construction, thereby helping to reduce storm water runoff and preserve natural, scenic characteristics of the land. 
(c)  Adequacy of streets and thoroughfares. 
(1)  Responsibility for adequacy of streets and thoroughfares. The property owner shall assure that the subdivision is served by adequate streets and thoroughfares, and shall be responsible for the costs of rights-of-way and street improvements, in accordance with the following policies and standards, and subject to the city's cost participation policies on oversized facilities. 
(2)  General adequacy policy. Every subdivision shall be served by improved streets and thoroughfares adequate to accommodate the vehicular traffic to be generated by the development. Proposed streets shall provide a safe, convenient and functional system for traffic circulation; shall be properly related to the city's thoroughfare plan, road classification system, comprehensive plan and any amendments thereto; and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of each development. 
(3)  Road network. New subdivisions shall be supported by a road network having adequate capacity, ingress/egress, and safe and efficient traffic circulation. The adequacy of the road network for developments of 50 or more dwelling units, or for developments generating 500 or more "one-way" trips per day, or for developments involving collector or arterial streets not appearing on the city's adopted thoroughfare plan, shall be demonstrated by preparation and submission, prior to or along with the preliminary plat application, of a traffic impact analysis prepared in accordance with subsection (f), traffic impact analysis, which takes into consideration the need to accommodate traffic generated by the development, land to be developed in common ownership and other developed property. In the event that the property to be developed is intended as a phase in a larger development project, or constitutes a portion of the land to be ultimately developed, the city council may require a demonstration of adequacy pursuant to this section for additional phases or portions of the property as a condition of approval for the proposed preliminary plat. In the event that the applicant submits a traffic impact analysis for an entire phased development project, the city may require an update of the study for each subsequent phase of the development that reflects any applicable changed conditions. If the preliminary plat is in conformance with the thoroughfare plan and if the preliminary plat is for a development of less than 50 dwelling units or for a development generating less than 500 "one-way" trips per day, then a traffic impact analysis is not required. 
(4)  Approach roads and access. All subdivisions must have at least two points of vehicular access (primarily for emergency vehicles), and must be connected via improved roadways to the city's improved thoroughfare and street system by one or more approach roads of such dimensions and improved to such standards as are hereinafter set forth. Requirements for dedication of right-of-way and improvement of approach roads may be increased depending upon the size or density of the proposed development, or if such need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis. 
a.  "Two points of vehicular access" shall be construed to mean that the subdivision has at least two improved roads accessing the subdivision from the city's improved thoroughfare system, and the subdivision has at least two road entrances. The city council may, at its discretion and upon a finding that such will not compromise public safety or impede emergency access, accept a single median-divided entrance from the city's improved thoroughfare system provided that the median extends into the subdivision for an unbroken length of at least 200 feet to an intersecting internal street which provides at least two routes to the interior of the subdivision. For example, the entrance street is not a dead-end or cul-de-sac, and it does not create a "bottleneck" allowing only one emergency route into the interior of the subdivision. (Also see section 11-3-1(u)) 
b.  The subdivision shall be designed to provide adequate emergency access for public safety vehicles. Each residential lot in the subdivision shall have a minimum frontage on a dedicated public street as required by applicable zoning or 35 feet, whichever is greater, unless other provisions have been authorized through planned development approval. 
(5)  Offsite improvements. Where traffic impact analysis demonstrates the need for such facilities, or where the city believes public safety is at risk, the property owner shall make such improvements to offsite collector and arterial streets and intersections as are necessary to mitigate traffic impacts generated by the development or in conjunction with related developments. The city may participate in the costs of oversize improvements with the property owner as set out herein, and subject to the city's cost participation policies on oversized improvements. 
(6)  Street dedications. 
a.  Dedication of right-of-way. The property owner shall provide all rights-of-way required for existing or future streets, and for all required street improvements, including perimeter streets and approach roads, as shown in the thoroughfare plan and as required by the TCSS or by other valid development plans approved by city council. In the case of perimeter streets, half of the total required right-of-way width for such streets shall be provided unless the proposed development is on both sides of the street, in which case the full right-of-way width shall be provided, or unless there is some other compelling reason to require more than half of the right-of-way width (such as avoiding the infringement upon or demolition of existing structures, avoiding crossing a creek or flood plain or some other obstacle, or other similar circumstance). In some instances, more than half of the required width shall be required when a half street is impractical or unsafe and depending upon the actual or proposed alignment of the street, such as in the case of a curved street, as may be required by the city council. 
b.  Perimeter streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision or addition, the other half of the street shall be dedicated, and an appropriate amount of the street shall be improved, by the developer of the new subdivision or addition. 
c.  Slope easements. The dedication of easements, in addition to dedicated rights-of-way shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall be no steeper than three feet horizontal run to one foot vertical height, or a three-to-one (3:1) slope. 
(7)  Street construction. All streets and thoroughfares shall be constructed and paved to city standards and within rights-of-way as required by the thoroughfare plan and this ordinance, and in accordance with the TCSS and other city standards as may be from time to time amended or adopted. 
(8)  Intersection improvements and traffic control devices. Intersection improvements and traffic control devices shall be installed as warranted in accordance with the traffic impact analysis required by subsection (f), or as may be required by the city for traffic safety and efficiency. Construction and design standards shall be in accordance with city standards and the TCSS. 
(9)  Phased development. Where a subdivision is proposed to occur in phases, the applicant, in conjunction with submission of the preliminary plat, shall provide a schedule of development. The schedule shall set forth the intended plan of development and dedication of rights-of-way for streets and street improvements, whether onsite or offsite, intended to serve each proposed phase of the subdivision. The city council shall determine whether the proposed streets and street improvements are adequate pursuant to standards herein established, and may require that a traffic impact analysis be submitted for the entire project or such phases as the city council determines to be necessary to adjudge whether the subdivision will be adequately served by streets and thoroughfares. 
(10)  Private streets. New subdivisions may not be constructed with private streets, nor may an existing subdivision's public streets be converted to private ownership. Any private street subdivisions that were in existence (i.e., platted of record at the county) on the effective date of this ordinance [Sept. 10, 2002] shall be allowed to remain as private street subdivisions provided that the conditions of the private streets and the maintenance thereof continues to meet or exceed city standards, and provided that a viable homeowners association (HOA) continues to exist to maintain the private streets and all appurtenances. The city will not assist in enforcing deed restrictions. The city may periodically inspect private streets, and may require any repairs necessary to ensure efficient emergency access and to protect the public health, safety, convenience and welfare. 
a.  Private streets-Construction and maintenance cost. The city shall not pay for any portion of the cost of constructing or maintaining a private street. 
b.  Private streets-Traffic control devices. All private traffic control devices and regulatory signs shall conform to the "Texas manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices", as amended, and to city standards. 
c.  Private streets-Restricted access. The entrances to all private streets shall be clearly marked with a sign, placed in a prominent and visible location, stating that the streets within the subdivision are private, and that they are not maintained nor regularly patrolled by the city. All restricted access entrances shall be manned 24 hours every day, or they shall provide a reliable, alternative means of ensuring access into the subdivision by the city, by emergency service providers, and by other utility or public service providers, such as postal carriers and utility companies, with appropriate identification. The method to be used to ensure city and emergency access into the subdivision shall be approved by the city's fire department and by any other applicable emergency service providers. If the association fails to maintain reliable access as required herein, the city may enter the private street subdivision and remove any gate or device that is a barrier to access at the sole expense of the association. 
d.  Private streets-Waiver of services. Certain city services may not be provided for private street subdivisions. Among the services that may not be provided are: routine law enforcement patrols, enforcement of traffic and parking regulations, preparation of accident reports, and streetlights. Street lighting may be provided via rent lights with the HOA being responsible for payment of monthly lighting invoices. Depending upon the characteristics of the development and upon access limitations posed by the design of entrances into the subdivision, other services (such as sanitation) may not be provided, as well. 
e.  Private streets-Petition to convert to public streets. The property owners association may petition the city to accept private streets and any associated property as public streets and right-of-way upon written notice to all association members and upon the favorable vote of a majority of the membership. However, in no event shall the city be obligated to accept said streets as public. Should the city elect to accept the streets as public, then the city has the right to inspect the private streets and to assess the lot owners for the expense of needed repairs concurrent with the city's acceptance of the streets. The city shall be the sole judge of whether repairs are needed. The city may also require, at the association's or the lot owners' expense, the removal of any guard houses, access control devices, landscaping or other aesthetic amenities located within the street lot or within any other common area. 
f.  Private streets-Hold harmless. The property owners association, as owner of the private streets and appurtenances, shall release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city, any other governmental entity, and any public utility entity for damages to the private streets that may be occasioned by the reasonable use of the private streets by same, and for damages and injury (including death) arising from the condition of the private streets, out of any use of access gates or cross arms, or out of any use of the subdivision by the city or governmental or utility entity. 
(d)  Escrow policies and procedures. 
(1)  Request for escrow. Whenever this ordinance requires a property owner to construct a street or thoroughfare, or other type of public improvement, the property owner may, if there exists unusual circumstances, such as a timing issue due to pending roadway improvements by another agency such as TxDOT or Parker County, that would present undue hardships or that would impede public infrastructure coordination or timing, petition the city to construct the street or thoroughfare, usually at a later date, in exchange for deposit of escrow as established in this section. If more than one street or thoroughfare must be constructed in order to meet adequacy requirements for roadways, as demonstrated by a traffic impact analysis, the city manager/mayor (or designee) may prioritize roadways for which escrow is to be accepted and require the deposit of all funds attributable to the development in escrow accounts for one or more of such affected roadways. The city council shall review the particular circumstances involved (a traffic impact analysis may be required to facilitate the city council's deliberations on the matter), and shall determine, at its sole discretion, whether or not provision of escrow deposits will be acceptable in lieu of the property owner's obligation to construct the street or thoroughfare with his or her development. 
(2)  Escrow deposit with the city. Whenever the city council agrees to accept escrow deposits in lieu of construction by the owner of the property under this ordinance, the property owner or developer shall deposit in escrow with the city an amount equal to his or her share of the costs of design, construction, permits, reviews and approvals, inspections, any additional land acquisition, and an appropriate (and realistic) inflation factor to ensure that the actual "future dollar" costs will be covered when actual construction occurs in the future. Such amount shall be reviewed and approved by the city manager/mayor (or designee) and by the city engineer, and shall be paid prior to release of engineering plans by the city engineer. The obligations and responsibilities of the property owner shall become those of the property owner's transferees, successors and assigns; and the liability therefore shall be joint and several. 
(3)  Determination of escrow amount. The amount of the escrow shall be determined by using the maximum comparable "turnkey" bid price of construction of the improvements (including design, permits, reviews and approvals, inspections and any additional land acquisition that may be needed). Such determination of the escrow amount shall be made as of the time the escrow is due hereunder, and shall be subject to the review and approval of the city manager/mayor (or designee) and the city engineer. 
(4)  Termination of escrow. Escrows, or portions of escrowed amounts, which have been placed with the city under this section and which have been held for a period of ten years from the date of such payment or agreement, in the event that the city has not authorized the preparation of plans and specifications for construction of such roadway facilities for which the escrow was made, shall, upon written request, be returned to the property owner, along with one-half of its accrued interest. Such return does not remove any obligations of the property owner for construction of the required facilities if a building permit has not been issued on the subject lot or if a new building permit is applied for. 
(5)  Refund. If any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed by a party other than the city, or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no cost to the city, the escrowed funds and accrued interest shall be refunded to the property owner or applicant who originally paid the escrow amount after completion and acceptance of the public improvements. In the event that a portion of the cost is borne by the city and the other portion of the cost by another party or governmental authority, the difference between the property owner's actual proportionate cost and the escrowed funds, including accrued interest, if any, shall be refunded after completion and acceptance of the improvements. 
(6)  Interest limitation. If money is refunded within six months of deposit, only the principal will be refunded. Monies returned after this date will be refunded with interest accrued, calculated at one percent less than the rate of actual earnings . 
(e)  Traffic impact analysis. Any proposed development project or plat involving a significant change to a proposed roadway alignment from that shown on the City of Weatherford's Thoroughfare Plan (or involving a development of 50 or more dwelling units, or for developments generating 500 or more "one-way" trips per day) shall be preceded by submission, city staff and planning and zoning board review, and city council approval of a traffic impact analysis as specified in subsection (f) below. Such a proposed roadway alignment change shall also be preceded by (or simultaneous with) an amendment to the city's thoroughfare plan showing the new proposed alignment. Failure to provide for such approvals prior to submission of a preliminary plat (or concurrently with the preliminary plat application) shall be grounds for denial of the plat application. 
(f)  Required components of traffic impact analysis (TIA). Whenever this ordinance (or the city council, in unique instances which do not necessarily meet the above criteria but which may significantly affect the public health, safety or welfare, such as a proposed subdivision that will only be accessed via substandard roadways which may pose an impediment to emergency response vehicles) require submission and city council approval of a traffic impact analysis, the following elements shall be included: 
(1)  General site description. The traffic impact analysis shall contain a map(s) delineating the TIA study area and all existing and planned streets contained therein. The study area shall be based on the total daily estimated trip generation. The study area shall be a one-mile radius for less than 10,000 trips per day. A larger radius shall be considered for more than 10,000 trips per day. 
(2)  Existing zoning and land uses. A description of the existing zoning and land uses in the area for which a development is proposed, including: existing land area by zoning classification, existing land area by current land use classification, and density figures expressed as FAR, square footage, numbers of hotel rooms, dwelling units, etc. 
(3)  Proposed development. A description of the proposed development including land area by proposed land use and density figures expressed as FAR, square footage, number of hotel rooms, dwelling units, etc. 
(4)  Thoroughfare network. A description of roadway development for a twenty-year planning horizon for the entire study area and base volumes of thoroughfares within the study area. 
(5)  Proposed capital improvements. The traffic impact analysis shall identify any changes to the roadway network within one mile of the site that are proposed by any government agency or other developer. This description shall include the above items as well as any proposed construction project that would alter the width or alignment of roadways affected by the proposed development. 
(6)  Roadway impact analysis. The TIA will describe the V/C ratio (volume/capacity) for all thoroughfares as shown on the City of Weatherford Major Thoroughfare Plan and delay projections for intersections in the studied area to determine if level of service cooperation is maintained. The analysis shall contain the following minimum information: 
a.  Transportation impacts: 
1.  Trip generation. The average weekday trip generation rates (trip ends), the average weekend trip generation rates (for uses other than residential or institutional), the highest average a.m. and p.m. hourly weekday trip generation rates, and the highest hourly weekend generation rates (for uses other than residential or institutional) for the proposed use shall be determined based upon the trip generation rates contained in the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation book; or shall be based upon data generated by actual field surveys of area uses compatible to the proposed use and approved by the city manager/mayor (or designee) and the city engineer. Trip generation calculations shall assume full development and occupancy. 
2.  Trip distribution. The distribution of trips to arterial and collector roadways within the study area identified in subsection 11-3-1(f)(1) (general site description) above shall be in conformity with accepted traffic engineering principles, taking into consideration the land use categories of the proposed development; the area from which the proposed development will attract traffic; competing developments (if applicable); the size of the proposed development; development phasing; surrounding existing and anticipated land uses, population and employment; existing and projected daily traffic volumes; and existing traffic conditions identified pursuant to subsection 11-3-1(f)(1) above. 
3.  Existing trip generation. Show in tabular form by land use the trips generated based on existing land use and zoning within the study area. 
b.  Adequacy determination. The roadway network included within the traffic impact analysis shall be considered adequate to serve the proposed development if existing roadways identified as arterials and collectors can accommodate the existing service volume, and the service volume of the proposed development, and the service volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid, unexpired building permits at a level of service "C" or above. 
(7)  Intersection analysis. 
a.  Level of service analysis. For intersections within the roadway traffic impact analysis area described in subsection 11-3-1(f)(1) herein (general site description), a level of service analysis shall be performed for all arterial to arterial, arterial to collector, collector to arterial, and collector to collector intersections, and for any other pertinent intersections identified by the city manager/mayor (or designee) or by the city engineer. Also, level of service analyses will be required on all proposed site driveway locations for all nonresidential developments. The city may waive analysis of minor intersections and site driveway locations within the one-mile radius. The level of service analysis shall be based upon the highest hourly average a.m. or p.m. peak weekday volume or highest average hourly peak weekend volume as determined from a two-day survey of weekday volumes and, where necessary, a one-day survey of weekend volumes. The level of service analysis shall take into consideration the lane geometry, traffic volume, percentage of right-hand turns, percentage of left-hand turns, percentage (and typical size) of trucks, intersection width, number of lanes, signal timing and progression, roadway grades, pedestrian and bicycle flows, school routes, number of accidents, and peak hour factor. Conclusions shall be included that describe the following: 
1.  Summary of points of conflict and congestion with all thoroughfare links or intersections that exceed a level of service "C" being identified; and 
2.  The percentage of change produced by the proposed development. 
b.  Adequacy analysis. The intersections included within the traffic impact analysis shall be considered adequate to serve the proposed development if existing intersections can accommodate the existing service volume, the service volume of the proposed development, and the service volume of approved but unbuilt developments holding valid, unexpired building permits at level of service "C" or above. 
(8)  Effect of adequacy determination. If the adequacy determination for roadways and intersections indicates that the proposed development would cause a reduction in the level of service for any roadway or intersection within the study area identified in subsection 11-3-1(f)(1) herein that would cause the roadway to fall below the level of service required hereto, the proposed development shall be denied unless the developer agrees to one of the following conditions: 
a.  The deferral of building permits until the improvements necessary to upgrade the substandard facilities are constructed; 
b.  A reduction in the density or intensity of development; 
c.  The dedication or construction of facilities needed to achieve the level of service required herein; or 
d.  Any combination of techniques identified herein that would ensure that development will not occur unless the levels of service for all roadways and intersections within the traffic impact analysis study are adequate to accommodate the impacts of such development. 
(g)  Arrangement of streets not shown on the thoroughfare plan. For streets that are not shown on the city's thoroughfare plan, such as local residential streets, the arrangement of such streets within a subdivision shall: 
(1)  Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets from or into surrounding areas; 
(2)  Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the city council to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformity to existing streets impractical; 
(3)  Provide for future access, such as by stubbing streets for future extension, to adjacent vacant areas which will likely develop under a similar zoning classification or for a similar type of land use; and 
(4)  Not conflict in any way with existing or proposed driveway openings (including those on the other side of an existing or planned median-divided arterial, in which case new streets shall align with such driveway openings such that median openings can be shared). 
(h)  Residential collector streets and minor residential streets shall be laid out such that their use by through traffic will be discouraged, such as via circuitous routes or multiple turns or offsets, but such that access is provided to adjacent subdivisions. 
(1)  Wherever the right-of-way width of a collector or residential street must transition to a greater or lesser width, such transition shall occur along the front, side or rear lot lines of adjacent lots (for a reasonable distance) and shall not occur within the street intersection itself. In other words, the right-of-way width shall be the same on both sides of the street intersection. 
(2)  To the greatest extent possible, the number of lots fronting along residential collector streets shall be minimized in order to ensure adequate traffic safety and efficiency. No more than 20 percent of the total centerline length of a collector street may have residential lots fronting onto the collector on each side of the street. For example, a collector street having a total centerline length (from one terminus to another) of 1,000 feet may have lots fronting onto it with a total frontage distance of 200 feet on each side of the street. Calculations shall be submitted with the preliminary plat application (and provided to the city planner and city engineer) verifying that lots fronting onto a collector street do not exceed the above. 
(3)  At least 50 percent of the total centerline length of all streets (including collector streets) within a residential subdivision (or within each phase of a residential subdivision, unless otherwise approved by city council to apply to the subdivision in its entirety rather than each individual phase) shall be curvilinear in design. Calculations shall be submitted with the preliminary plat application (and provided to the city planner and city engineer) verifying that the above curvilinear street requirement is being met. 
(i)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the city council may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage (lots which back onto the arterial), deep lots with rear service alleys, or such treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(j)  Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is required by the city and approved by the city council. 
(k)  Intersecting, undivided streets with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall be avoided. Intersecting streets onto an existing or future divided roadway must be configured such that the centerline offset will accommodate the appropriate median opening and left-turn lanes (with required transition and stacking distances) on each divided roadway, and shall be aligned with any existing or proposed streets or driveways on the opposite side of the divided roadway (in order to share the median opening). 
(l)  A street intersection with a major thoroughfare shall be at a 90-degree angle and shall be tangent to the intersecting street for at least 100 feet. All other street intersections shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at a ninety-degree angle or radial to the centerline of the intersecting street for the full right-of-way of the intersecting street, and tangent to the intersecting street for at least 50 feet. No street shall intersect at an angle that is less than 85 degrees. 
(m)  Street right-of-way widths shall be as shown on the thoroughfare plan and as defined by the corresponding roadway cross-sections on the thoroughfare plan and in the city's TCSS manual. 
(n)  Construction of half streets shall be prohibited, except when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conforming with the other requirements of this ordinance and the thoroughfare plan, and where the city council makes a determination that there is no immediate benefit to be gained by constructing the full street section since no access from the street will be needed by the subdivision in question. The city council may also find that it would be more practical, or cost effective, to delay construction of the other half of a street until when the adjoining property is developed. 
    If the property owner is responsible for one-half of the street, then the property owner shall either construct the facility along with his or her development or shall provide escrow for the construction cost of his or her share of the facility (including all applicable street appurtenances such as median openings, left turn lanes into the development, sidewalks with barrier-free ramps, drainage structures, etc.) unless the city participates in the construction of the facility. Whenever a partial street has been previously platted along a common property line, the other portion of the street right-of-way shall be dedicated such that the right-of-way is increased to the street's ultimate planned width. Improvements shall be made to all onsite facilities as defined herein (see definitions, section 11-1-13). 
(o)  The maximum length of any block or street segment (including a looped street) shall be 1,600 feet and the minimum length of any block or street segment shall be 400 feet, as measured along the street centerline and between the point(s) of intersection with other through, but not dead-end or cul-de-sac streets. 
(p)  A cul-de-sac street shall not be longer than 600 feet, and at the closed end shall have a turnaround bulb with an outside pavement diameter of at least 80 feet and a right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. The length of a cul-de-sac shall be measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the centerline of the cul-de-sac bulb. 
(q)  The commission may recommend, and the city council may approve, waivers/suspensions for overlength streets or culs-de-sac, whether temporary or permanent, upon considering the following: 
(1)  Alternative designs which would reduce street or cul-de-sac length; 
(2)  The effect of overlength streets upon access, congestion, delivery of municipal services, and upon convenience to residents of the subdivision in traveling to and from their homes; and 
(3)  Means of mitigation, including but not limited to additional mid-block street connections, limitation on the number of lots to be served along an overlength street segment or cul-de-sac, temporary (or permanent) points of emergency access, and additional fire protection measures. 
(r)  Except in unusual cases, no dead-end streets will be approved unless such dead-end streets are provided to connect with future streets on adjacent land. In the case of dead-end streets which will eventually be extended into the adjacent subdivision, no more than one lot (per side) can front onto the dead-end street stub unless a temporary turnaround bulb (with the appropriate temporary street easement) is provided at the end. A temporary dead-end street shall not exceed the maximum allowed length of a normal cul-de-sac, and the temporary turnaround bulb must be constructed like a cul-de-sac, as provided in subsection (p) above (the city engineer may authorize the use of asphalt or other durable paving material than concrete for the arc, or "wing," portions of the temporary turnaround bulb in order to minimize the cost of removing those portions later on). A note shall be placed on the final plat clearly labeling any temporary dead-end streets (if any) that will at some point be extended into the adjacent property, and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street stub, such as on the barricade, also stating that the street will be extended in the future. Signage and lettering must be large enough to be legible by a person with normal vision at a 20-foot distance. Any required temporary turnaround easements shall be shown on the final plat along with their appropriate recording information, if they are offsite or established by separate instrument. 
(s)  New streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets, and shall be dedicated at equal or greater right-of-way widths than the existing streets for an appropriate transition length, if applicable. 
(t)  Construction of new streets. All new streets dedicated within a subdivision shall be constructed in accordance with paving widths and specifications as set forth in the TCSS of the City of Weatherford at the time at which the preliminary plat application is officially submitted and deemed a complete application. 
(u)  Points of access. All subdivisions shall have at least two points of access from improved public roadways (also see subsection 11-3-1(c)(4)). All residential developments shall provide no less than one entrance for every 50 lots, or portion thereof, including temporary dead-end stubbed streets that will eventually provide connections into adjacent future developments and thence to an arterial or collector street. Driveway access onto roadways shall be provided and designed in accordance with the city's TCSS and construction standards that are in effect at the time the preliminary plat application is officially submitted and deemed a complete application. Residential driveway cuts shall not be allowed on roadways that are larger than a residential collector street (60-foot right-of-way) unless specifically approved by city council with the preliminary or final plat application. 
(v)  Streets will be constructed in accordance to the city's TCSS and construction standards that are in effect at the time the preliminary plat application is officially submitted and deemed a complete application. 
(w)  Rural street sections may be used for subdivisions that do not contain lots with less than three acres of lot area. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.1, 9-10-02; Ord. No. 353-2008-27,  1, 4-22-08) 
Sec. 11-3-2. - Alleys. 
(a)  Service alleys in nonresidential districts, if provided or constructed by the developer, shall be a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet and a pavement width of 24 feet. 
(b)  In the interest of reducing storm water runoff and resultant erosion, sedimentation and conveyance of nonpoint source pollutants, residential alleys shall be prohibited in single-family subdivisions within the City of Weatherford and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, and shall only be permitted or required in instances where a subdivision must connect into existing alleys for the purpose of providing continuity or convenience. If alleys are constructed or required, the following standards shall be met: 
(1)  In residential districts, alleys shall be parallel, or approximately parallel, to the frontage of the street. Alleys in residential districts shall provide a minimum of 15 feet of right-of-way and ten feet of pavement. 
(c)  General design standards for alleys (if provided). 
(1)  Alleys shall be paved in accordance with the City of Weatherford's TCSS and construction standards that are in effect at the time the preliminary plat application is officially submitted and deemed a complete application. 
(2)  Where the deflection of alley alignment occurs, the design of the paving and property line shall be as established by the TCSS. 
(3)  Dead-end or "hammerhead" alleys shall not be allowed. Alleys must have adequate turnouts and street entrances such that vehicular traffic flow is continuous and efficient. Where a temporary dead-end alley situation is unavoidable, a temporary turnaround bulb or turnout onto a street, either of which will need a temporary easement for street or alley purposes, shall be provided as determined by the city engineer. 
(4)  Alleys may not exceed a maximum length of 1,600 feet, as measured along the centerline of the alley and between intersections with other alleys or entrances onto streets (at the right-of-way line of the street at the alley entrance). The commission may recommend, and the city council may approve, waivers/suspensions for overlength alleys upon consideration of the following: 
a.  Alternative designs which would reduce alley length; 
b.  The effect of overlength alleys upon access, congestion, delivery of municipal services, and upon convenience to residents of the subdivision in accessing rear driveways and in driving around to the front of their homes; and 
c.  Means of mitigation, including but not limited to additional mid-block alley turnouts, limitation on the number of lots to be served along a single alley segment, temporary points of access, and additional fire protection measures. 
(5)  Alley intersections shall be perpendicular and at a 90-degree angle or radial to the intersecting alley centerline for the full alley right-of-way width, and intersection pavement shall be of sufficient width and inside radius to accommodate waste collection and emergency vehicles. Intersections shall be three-way wherever possible, and four-way intersections shall be avoided. No alley intersection serving more than four directions shall be allowed. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.2, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-3-3. - Easements. 
(a)  The minimum width for city utility easements shall be 15 feet or as otherwise required by the city engineer. The minimum width for city drainage easements shall be as required by the city engineer. The width of easements for other utility providers, such as for gas, electric, telephone or cable television, shall be as required by that particular entity. It shall be the applicant's responsibility to determine appropriate easement widths required by other utility companies (also see section 11-3-8). Wherever possible, easements shall be centered or along front or side lot lines rather than across the interior or rear of lots, particularly where no alleys will be provided behind the lots. 
(b)  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway or channel, there shall be provided a storm drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with such course and of such additional width as may be designated by the city engineer, subject to determination according to proper engineering considerations. The required width shall conform to the requirements set forth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and/or the city. Parallel streets or parkways shall be required adjacent to certain portions of creek or drainageways to provide maintenance access and/or public access and visibility into public open space or recreation areas (see article IV). The number of lots that back or side onto creeks, drainageways, public parks and open spaces, and public school sites shall be severely limited, and possibly prohibited, such that public access, visibility, safety and security within these areas are maximized. Other utilities may be permitted within a drainage or floodway easement only if approved by the city engineer and any other applicable entity requiring the drainage or floodway easement. 
(c)  A lot's area shall be computed inclusive of all easements. However, there shall be a minimum buildable area, exclusive of required easements, buffer zones and setbacks for each lot. The minimum buildable area shall be an area one-half of the required minimum lot size. If the city disputes the buildable area of any lot, the applicant shall submit verification in writing that the buildable area is adequate for the type of housing product (or nonresidential building) proposed for that lot. Final approval of the allowed buildable area for any lot shall be by the city. 
(d)  Where alleys are not provided in a residential subdivision, a minimum ten-foot wide utility easement shall be provided along the front of all lots, adjacent to and flush with the street right-of-way line for the potential placement of utility facilities. 
(e)  For new development, all necessary onsite easements shall be established on the subdivision plat and not by separate instrument, and they shall be labeled for the specific purpose, and to the specific entity if other than the city, for which they are being provided. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: a public utility easement, which is dedicated to the city for a water, sanitary sewer, or electric line; a drainage easement which is dedicated to the city for a drainage structure; an access easement, which is dedicated to the public for unrestricted access purposes; a fire lane easement, which is dedicated to the city and its fire suppression and emergency medical service providers for access purposes; an electrical, gas or telephone easement, which is dedicated to the specific utility provider that requires the easement; and so on. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.3, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-3-4. - Blocks. 
(a)  The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
(1)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
(2)  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes, setbacks and dimensions (if within the city's corporate limits); and 
(3)  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic and for pedestrians or bicyclists traveling to a public park or school site or other facility within or close to the neighborhood. 
(b)  Intersecting streets, which determine the lengths and widths of blocks, shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately, to provide adequate fire protection, and to conform to customary subdivision practices. Where no existing subdivision or topographical constraints control, the block lengths shall not exceed 1,600 feet in length. Where no existing subdivision or topographical constraints control, the blocks shall not be less than 400 feet in length; however, in cases where physical barriers or property ownership creates conditions where it is appropriate that these standards be varied, the length may be increased or decreased (through issuance of a waiver/suspension by the city council with plat approval) to meet the existing conditions having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of traffic and public safety. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.4, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-3-5. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  Pedestrian concrete walkways (sidewalks) not less than four-feet wide shall be required within a residential subdivision on both sides of residential and collector streets, and sidewalks not less than five-feet wide shall be provided within all nonresidential developments and along all perimeter arterials, for both residential and nonresidential developments, as set forth in the City of Weatherford's TCSS. Barrier-free ramps shall be constructed at all street intersections and at any other locations deemed appropriate by the city due to anticipated pedestrian travel patterns. Sidewalks shall be constructed within the street right-of-way, one foot away from the right-of-way line, and at least five feet away from the street curb. Generally, sidewalks shall be built so that their location immediately above any existing or future utility infrastructure is minimized or avoided. In certain instances, the city council may, at its sole discretion, approve placement of the sidewalk adjacent or closer than five feet to the curb provided that such placement benefits the general public by allowing more space for landscaping, such as for street trees, screening shrubs, and decorative walls and fences, and provided that the width is increased to a minimum of five feet of sidewalk pavement or to such a width as may be needed in the interest of public safety. 
(b)  All sidewalks along a perimeter roadway or arterial are considered part of the overall development's required public improvements and shall be installed prior to acceptance of the subdivision by the city and prior to final plat approval, unless surety is provided, per article VI. In any event, a certificate of occupancy will not be issued for any lot within the subdivision until the required sidewalks are in place or appropriate surety is provided. 
    The cost and provision of any perimeter sidewalks, such as along major thoroughfares, may be escrowed as a part of a developers agreement, if approved by the city council. The city has the right, but not the obligation, to refuse escrow and to require paving of the sidewalks if, in its sole opinion, immediate provision of the sidewalks is necessary for safe pedestrian circulation or if it would otherwise protect the public health, safety, convenience or welfare. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.5, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-3-6. - Lots. 
(a)  Lots shall conform to the minimum requirements of the established zoning district, if located within the city's corporate limits. 
(b)  Each lot on a subdivision plat shall front onto a dedicated, improved public street unless platted as an approved private street subdivision in accordance with this ordinance (see section 11-3-1(c)(10)). Lot width and access shall conform to the provisions of the City of Weatherford's Zoning Ordinance (if within the city's limits), comprehensive plan, and any other applicable city code or ordinance. In all cases, single-family residential lots shall have a minimum of 35 feet of frontage, and nonresidential lots shall have a minimum of 50 feet of frontage, along a dedicated, improved street. 
(c)  Irregular-shaped lots shall have sufficient width at the building line to meet lot width and frontage requirements of the appropriate zoning district (if within the city's limits), and shall provide a reasonable building pad without encroachment into front, side or rear yard setbacks or into any type of easement. Also, the rear width shall be sufficient to provide access for all necessary utilities, including access for driveways and solid waste collection when alleys are present (minimum twenty-foot alley frontage). In general, triangular, severely elongated or tapered, "flag" or "panhandle" lots shall be avoided, and the city reserves the right to disapprove any lot which, in its sole opinion, will not be suitable or desirable for the purpose intended, which is an obvious attempt to circumvent the purpose and intent of lot configuration or lot width minimums, or which is so oddly shaped as to create a hindrance to the logical lot layout of surrounding properties. 
(d)  Side lot lines shall be at ninety-degree angles or radial to street right-of-way lines to the greatest extent possible. The city reserves the right to disapprove any lot which, in its sole opinion, is shaped or oriented in such a fashion as to be unsuitable or undesirable for the purpose intended, or which is not attractively or appropriately oriented toward its street frontage. 
(e)  Double frontage lots shall be avoided, except where they may be essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials, as defined in section 11-3-1, or to overcome a specific disadvantage or hardship imposed by topography or other factors. Where lots have double frontage, building setback lines shall be established for each street side, and rear yard screening shall be provided in accordance with section 11-5-7. Residential lots shall not back onto any residential street or collector street within a residential area or neighborhood, and shall not have more than one-half of its perimeter boundaries along streets. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.6, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-3-7. - Building lines. 
    Front and street side building lines shall be shown on a concept plan and on any type of plat for all lots, and shall be consistent with the Zoning Ordinance requirements for the district in which the development is located (if subject to the city's zoning regulations) and with any other applicable city ordinance, respectively. For property that is not subject to the city's zoning regulations, such as property that lies within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, the minimum front building line shall be as follows: 
(1)  Any residential, nonresidential or multiple-family property, parcel or lot which fronts onto any other existing or future roadway: The front building setback shall be 40 feet. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.7, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-3-8. - Utility services (provided by the City of Weatherford and others). 
(a)  For purposes of this section, the following meanings shall apply: 
    "Utility services." The facilities of any person, firm or corporation providing electric, natural gas, telephone, cable television, or any other such item or service for public use approved. 
    "Feeder or feeder/lateral line." High voltage supply electric lines carrying more than 12,000 volts that emanate from substations used to distribute power through an area to an unspecified number of customers. 
    "Lateral lines." Those electric or telephone lines used to distribute power from a feeder line to a single subdivision. These electric lines are normally connected to a feeder line through a sectionalizing device such as a fuse. 
    "Service lines." Those electric lines used to connect between the utilities' supply system or lateral lines and the end user's meter box. 
(b)  All subdivision plats and engineering plans submitted to the City of Weatherford for approval shall provide for utility services such as electrical, gas, telephone and cable television utility lines, including lateral or service distribution lines, and wires to be placed underground. Feeder and other major transmission lines may remain overhead within the appropriate easements. However, an applicant shall endeavor and, whenever the utility director determines that there exists sufficient space or easements and the electrical infrastructure may be modified, the city shall require that feeder lines are placed away from major or minor thoroughfares or arterials, as shown on the thoroughfare plan. Unless authorized by the utility director, feeder lines that are to be placed overhead shall not be placed along both sides of the street right-of-way. Verification of acceptance of easement locations and widths by the public utilities shall be provided to the city, by the applicant, prior to final plat approval by the city council, and all easements shall be reviewed by the utility companies and by the city engineer (for those to the city) prior to granting final approval for any residential subdivision affected by this section. The applicant shall also, prior to final plat approval, provide a letter of commitment from each utility provider, such as those providing electricity, gas, telephone and cable television, who will serve the development that said utility providers will ensure the provision of necessary infrastructure and service to all portions of the proposed development within 12 months following final plat approval. Failure to submit such letters of commitment from utility providers shall constitute grounds for denial of the final plat application on the basis that there is no written assurance that the development can be served by essential utility services. 
(c)  Each of the utility companies shall be responsible for developing administrative policies, criteria for easement size, and cost reimbursement procedures for the installation and extension of their underground utilities. Nothing herein shall prohibit or restrict any utility company from recovering the difference in cost of overhead facilities and underground utilities from the property owner in accordance with the provisions of such utility's approved tariff. No utility company shall be required or permitted to begin construction of underground facilities unless and until the property owner or developer of the subdivision has made arrangements satisfactory to the specific utility company for the payment of such difference between the cost of overhead facilities and underground facilities. 
(d)  All electrical and telephone support equipment, including transformers, amplifiers and switching devices necessary for underground installations, shall be pad- or ground-mounted, or shall be placed underground and not overhead, unless the subdivision is served from perimeter overhead electrical facilities. Pad- or ground-mounted utility equipment shall be completely screened by an opaque screen of either fencing materials, live plant materials or other similar material or combination of materials, as authorized by the planning director, and must be of such height tall enough to completely shield said pad- or ground-mounted utility equipment from view of any public roadway, and shall not be located within any required visibility area, such as at street intersections or corners or at driveway openings. Said screening must be designed to provide adequate clearance to provide for appropriate airflow and must meet the minimum standards contained within the city's adopted TCSS. The City of Weatherford shall have the right to remove all or parts of said screening that may in any way endanger or interfere with the construction, maintenance or efficiency of the city's electrical system. Screening may be removed in order to construct, reconstruct, inspect, patrol, maintain, read meters, and add to or remove part of the electrical system without the necessity at any time of procuring the permission from anyone. Said removal shall not require the city to replace any screening materials or in any other way compensate any property owner for the removal of any screening material. 
(e)  Temporary construction service may be provided by overhead electric lines and facilities without obtaining a waiver/suspension or special exception, provided that when the underground utility service to any portion of a subdivision is completed, such overhead electric lines and facilities are promptly removed. 
(f)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any existing facilities in place prior to the effective date of this ordinance [Sept. 10, 2002] to be placed underground. 
(g)  The metering for utilities such as water, gas and electricity shall be located on the individual lots to be served, not grouped together in a centralized location(s), such as "gang-box" style metering stations, which shall not be permitted. 
(h)  The locations, widths and configurations of easements for any utility service provider other than the City of Weatherford shall be determined, approved and acquired (if necessary) by the applicable utility service provider. 
(i)  Escrow policies and procedures. 
(1)  Request for escrow. Whenever this ordinance requires a property owner to construct water, wastewater, electric or other public utility improvements, the property owner may, if there exists unusual circumstances, such as a timing issue due to pending utility improvements by another agency that would present undue hardships or that would impede public infrastructure coordination or timing, petition the city to construct the public utility improvements, usually at a later date, in exchange for deposit of escrow as established in this section. The city council shall review the particular circumstances involved and shall determine, at its sole discretion, whether or not provision of escrow deposits will be acceptable in lieu of the property owner's obligation to construct the utility improvements with his or her development. 
(2)  Escrow deposit with the city. Whenever the city council agrees to accept escrow deposits in lieu of construction by the owner of the property under this ordinance, the property owner or developer shall deposit in escrow with the city an amount equal to his or her share of the costs of design, construction, permits, reviews and approvals, inspections, any additional land acquisition, and an appropriate (and realistic) inflation factor to ensure that the actual "future dollar" costs will be covered when actual construction occurs in the future. Such amount shall be reviewed and approved by the city manager/mayor (or designee) and by the city engineer, and shall be paid prior to release of engineering plans by the city engineer. The obligations and responsibilities of the property owner shall become those of the property owner's transferees, successors and assigns; and the liability therefore shall be joint and several. 
(3)  Determination of escrow amount. The amount of the escrow shall be determined by using the maximum comparable "turnkey" bid price of construction of the improvements (including design, permits, reviews and approvals, inspections and any additional land acquisition that may be needed). Such determination of the escrow amount shall be made as of the time the escrow is due hereunder, and shall be subject to the review and approval of the city manager/mayor (or designee) and the city engineer. 
(4)  Termination of escrow. Escrows, or portions of escrowed amounts, which have been placed with the city under this section and which have been held for a period of ten years from the date of such payment or agreement, in the event that the city has not authorized the preparation of plans and specifications for construction of such roadway facilities for which the escrow was made, shall, upon written request, be returned to the property owner, along with one-half of its accrued interest. Such return does not remove any obligations of the property owner for construction of the required facilities if a building permit has not been issued on the subject lot or if a new building permit is applied for. 
(5)  Refund. If any street or highway for which escrow is deposited is constructed by a party other than the city, or is reconstructed by another governmental authority at no cost to the city, the escrowed funds and accrued interest shall be refunded to the property owner or applicant who originally paid the escrow amount after completion and acceptance of the public improvements. In the event that a portion of the cost is borne by the city and the other portion of the cost by another party or governmental authority, the difference between the property owner's actual proportionate cost and the escrowed funds, including accrued interest, if any, shall be refunded after completion and acceptance of the improvements. 
(6)  Interest limitation. If money is refunded within six months of deposit, only the principal will be refunded. Monies returned after this date will be refunded with interest accrued, calculated at one percent less than the rate of actual earnings. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.8, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-3-9. - Water and wastewater facility design. 
(a)  All new subdivisions shall be connected to the city's water system, shall install RPZ backflow prevention and shall be capable of providing water for health and emergency purposes, including fire protection. Private, onsite water wells will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the city engineer and only where lot sizes are three acres or greater. Should private water wells be allowed, the developer will be responsible for providing a groundwater availability certification in accordance with current TCEQ regulations. Submission of a groundwater availability certification in no way guarantees approval for use of private individual waste wells. In no case, will a private water well be allowed to serve more than one lot. All private water wells are subject to city approval and provided that all appropriate permits are procured from the city, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the TCEQ, and any other applicable agency(s). The design and construction of water system improvements and private water wells shall comply with the following standards: 
(1)  Design and construction of a water source on the site shall be in accordance with applicable regulations of the Texas Board on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). 
(2)  Design and construction of water service from the city shall be in accordance with the standards in the city's TCSS manual, and in accordance with TCEQ standards. 
(3)  Design and construction of a fire protection and suppression system shall be in accordance with the standards in the TCSS manual, and in accordance with the city's fire department and fire code. 
(b)  All new subdivisions shall be served by the city's wastewater collection and treatment system. The design and construction of the wastewater system improvements shall be in accordance with the standards in the city's TCSS manual, and in accordance with TCEQ. Private onsite wastewater treatment unit will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the city engineer and only where lot sizes are three acres or greater. In no case, will an onsite wastewater treatment unit be allowed to serve more than one lot. All private onsite wastewater treatment units are subject to city approval and provided that all appropriate permits are procured from the city, the county health department, the TCEQ, and any other applicable agency(s). The design and construction of onsite wastewater treatment unit shall comply with applicable regulations of the Texas Board on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). 
(c)  The subdivider shall be responsible for: 
(1)  Phasing of development or improvements in order to maintain adequate water and wastewater services; 
(2)  Extensions of utility lines to connect to existing utility services; 
(3)  Providing and/or procuring all necessary easements for the utilities (whether onsite or offsite); 
(4)  Providing proof to the city of adequate water and wastewater service; 
(5)  Providing provisions for future expansion of the utilities if such will be needed to serve future developments, subject to the city's oversize participation policies, if applicable; 
(6)  Providing all operations and maintenance of the utilities, or providing proof that a separate entity will be responsible for the operations and maintenance of the utilities; 
(7)  Providing all fiscal security required for the construction of the utilities; 
(8)  Obtaining approvals from the applicable utility providers if other than the city; 
(9)  Complying with all requirements of the utility providers, including the city; 
(10)  Record drawings; and 
(11)  Replacing lines in order to comply with the utility master plans. 
(d)  Extensions of water and wastewater mains. Unless approved in writing by the utilities department, all developments shall be required to extend water and wastewater mains across the entire frontage of the subdivision in such an alignment that it can be extended to the next property in accordance with the master water and sewer plans for the city. Properties already served by water and sewer shall not be required to install additional facilities unless the current lines are not of adequate capacity to serve the proposed development, in which case the developer will be required to install adequate facilities. 
(e)  Oversized water and wastewater infrastructure. The city may participate in the cost of oversized water and sewer mains, lift stations and other facilities necessary to serve a proposed development pursuant to subsection 11-6-2(c). "Oversized mains" are defined as mains with pipe sizes larger than ten inches in diameter for water and 12 inches in diameter for sewer, which are required by the city for future expansion of the water and wastewater systems in conformance with the city's master water and sewer plans and are not required to provide adequate service to the proposed development. "Oversized lift stations and other facilities" is defined as capacity in excess of that required to provide adequate service to the proposed development and is in conformance with the city's master water and sewer plans. Prior to beginning construction of any facility for which the city is to participate in the cost thereof, the developer and the city shall enter into a written agreement as specified in subsection 11-6-2(c). The developer shall bear all the costs, including costs associated with oversizing. The obligation for the city to repay for oversized facilities shall not commence until the facility(s) are included and funded in a CIP program. In addition to any such other terms as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, the agreement shall provide that if construction of the facility does not commence within one year of the date of the agreement, it shall terminate, unless written extension thereof is approved by both the developer and the city. 
(f)  Installation, operations and maintenance of utilities not specifically referenced herein shall comply with regulations of the TCEQ, and with any other applicable state rules and regulations, whichever is the most stringent requirement. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.9, 9-10-02; Ord. No. 353-2008-27,  1, 4-22-08) 
Sec. 11-3-10. - Storm water collection and conveyance systems. 
(a)  System design requirements. Drainage improvements shall accommodate runoff from the upstream drainage area in its anticipated maximum "build-out" condition, and shall be designed to prevent overloading the capacity of the downstream drainage system. The city may require the phasing of development, the use of control methods such as retention or detention, or the construction of offsite drainage improvements in order to mitigate the impact of the proposed development. No storm water collection system shall be constructed unless it is designed in accordance with the city's TCSS manual by a licensed professional engineer, and unless it is reviewed and approved by the city engineer. All plans submitted to the city engineer for approval shall include a layout of the drainage system together with supporting calculations for the design of the system. 
(b)  All erosion and sedimentation controls shall conform to the TCSS manual. For erosion and sedimentation control, the city uses the latest edition of "Storm Water Quality Best Management Practices for Construction Activities in North Central Texas" (by the NCTCOG), a copy of which is on file at the city. 
(c)  No person, individual, partnership, firm or corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reclaim, reroute or change the course or location of any existing ditch, channel, stream or drainageway without first obtaining written permission of the city engineer and any other applicable agency (such as FEMA or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) having jurisdiction. The city engineer may, at his or her discretion, require preparation and submission of a FEMA or flood study for a proposed development if there are concerns regarding storm drainage on the subject property or upstream or downstream from the subject property. The costs of such study, if required, shall be borne by the developer. 
(d)  In order to help reduce storm water runoff, and resulting erosion, sedimentation and conveyance of nonpoint source pollutants, the layout of the street network, lots and building sites shall, to the greatest extent possible, be sited and aligned along natural contour lines, and shall minimize the amount of cut and fill on slopes in order to minimize the amount of land area that is disturbed during construction. 
(e)  No cross-street flow (i.e., perpendicular to traffic flow) of storm water runoff shall be permitted unless approved by the city engineer. When and if such drainage flow is allowed, it must be across a concrete street (i.e., valley gutter) and as approved by the city engineer. 
(f)  All storm water retention or detention facilities which are not located underground shall be designed using materials and techniques as established in the city's TCSS manual or as may be required by the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  3.10, 9-10-02) 
ARTICLE IV. - PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES 

Sec. 11-4-1. - Areas for public use. 
(a)  The applicant shall give consideration to suitable and adequate sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, and other areas for public use or service so as to conform with the recommendations contained in the city's comprehensive plan; park and open space plan; and other applicable plans. Any provision for schools, parks or other public facilities shall be indicated on the preliminary and final plat, and shall be subject to approval by city council. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  4.1, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-4-2. - Protection of drainage and creek areas. 
(a)  All creeks and drainage areas shall be preserved and protected in their natural condition wherever possible, unless significant storm drainage improvements are required by the city in these areas. All development adjacent to creeks and drainage areas shall be in accordance with the city's TCSS manual, and with any other city policies or ordinances related to aesthetics or public access or enjoyment of creeks and waterways. 
(b)  Definitions and methodology for determining the Floodway Management Area (FMA). The definitions for "floodway" and "floodway fringe" shall correspond to those set forth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the concept of a floodway is used as a tool to assist the local community in the aspect of flood plain management. Under this concept, the area of the 100-year flood is divided into a floodway and floodway fringe. The floodway is the channel of a stream plus any adjacent flood plain areas that must be kept free of encroachment in order that the 100-year flood may be carried without substantial increases in flood heights as defined by FEMA. The area between the floodway and boundary of the 100-year flood is termed the floodway fringe. The floodway fringe is the area that can be used for development by means of fill according to FEMA and city engineering criteria. 
    For the purposes of this ordinance, the floodway management area (FMA) will correspond to the floodway, as defined by FEMA, or as may be modified pursuant to a flood study that is approved by FEMA. 
(c)  Areas where an FMA is required. All drainage areas or regulated floodways as referenced on the applicable floodway and flood boundary map (flood insurance rate map, or FIRM) shall be included in the FMA. If FEMA does not specify a floodway zone in any of the creeks or their tributaries, it shall be the developer's responsibility to establish and identify the FMA. The determination shall be made by a licensed professional engineer and approved by the city engineer. Where improvements to a drainage area are required by other ordinances of the city for the purpose of safety or other reasons related to drainage, those ordinances shall also be observed. The FMA is intended to apply to a creek or channel that is to remain open or in its natural condition. The creek shall remain in its natural state unless improvements are permitted or required by the city due to the pending development of properties adjacent to or upstream of the required improvements. 
(d)  Ownership and maintenance of the FMA. The area determined to be the FMA shall be designated on the preliminary plat. Approximate locations shall be shown on zoning change requests and concept plans-Accurate locations of the FMA shall be established on the preliminary plat and prior to site construction. At the city's option, the FMA shall be protected by one of the following methods: 
(1)  Dedicated to the City of Weatherford; or 
(2)  Easement(s). Creeks or drainageways on tracts that have private maintenance provisions, other than single- or two-family platted lots, can be designated as the FMAs by an easement to the city on the preliminary plat (with the appropriate plat language, as required by the city). Subdivisions with platted single-family or two-family lots may designate the FMA by easement provided there are adequate maintenance provisions (such as by a mandatory homeowners association), but no lots or portions of lots may be platted in the easement unless specifically allowed by the city. The area designated as FMA may be identified by a tract number; or 
(3)  Certain recreational uses normally associated with or adjacent to flood-prone areas (no structures allowed in the FMA), such as golf courses or certain types of parks. The uses allowed shall be in conformance with the zoning ordinance and approved by the planning and zoning board and city council. Use of the FMA as public park land shall also require approval by the city's park board. 
Prior to acceptance of any drainageway as an FMA by the city, the area shall be cleared of all debris and brush (except for mature trees) and placed in a maintainable state. Floodway management areas dedicated to the city shall be left in a natural state except those areas designated for active recreational purposes and unless storm drainage requirements do not permit this to occur. 
(e)  Design criteria. The following design criteria shall be required for development adjacent to the FMA: 
(1)  Adequate access shall be provided to and along the FMA for public and/or private maintenance. An unobstructed area a minimum of 20-feet wide with a maximum 5:1 slope (five feet horizontal to one foot vertical), the length of the floodway shall be provided adjacent to or within the FMA. On the opposite side of the drainage area, an unobstructed area having a minimum width of five feet shall be provided. 
(2)  Lots in a single-family, PD single-family, or duplex residential zoning district shall not be platted within the FMA, and no more than ten percent of the linear length of the FMA (on each side) shall be allowed to have lots backing or siding onto it. If lots back or side onto an FMA, at least two reasonable points of access to the FMA, each a minimum of 20 feet in width, shall be provided. Streets, alleys and open-ended culs-de-sac may qualify as access points if designed such that they are navigable by maintenance vehicles (e.g., alleys must be 20-foot width). All areas of the FMA shall be accessible from the access points and shall be visible from access points. Lots used for multi-family dwellings may be platted in the FMA if the FMA is identified as an easement and is maintained as open space for use by the residents, and provided that access to the FMA is possible by city maintenance vehicles, should that need arise. If the FMA is to be public park land, then adequate public access and good public visibility shall also be provided to all portions of it. 
(3)  Public streets may be approved in the FMA by the planning and zoning board and city council (if they conform to applicable engineering standards). 
(4)  Linear public streets may be required to be constructed adjacent to some (or all) portions of the FMA to allow access for maintenance or recreational opportunities, and/or to allow increased visibility into creek areas for public safety and security purposes. 
(5)  Alternate designs to facilitate equal or better access may be permitted if approved by the planning and zoning board and city council. 
(f)  Drainage areas that have been altered and are not in a natural condition can be exempted from an FMA and this section at the discretion of the city council and upon recommendation by the planning and zoning board. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  4.2, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-4-3. - Property owners or homeowners associations. 
(a)  Applicability. When a subdivision contains either common open space or other improvements which are not intended to be dedicated to the City of Weatherford for public use, such as private streets, a private recreation facility, private streetlights, landscaped entry features or other private amenities, a property owners or homeowners association agreement consistent with state and other appropriate laws, must be submitted to and approved by the city manager/mayor (or designee) and the city attorney. The conditions, covenants and restrictions (CCRs) and the association documents, such as the articles of incorporation and association by-laws, shall be submitted to the city for review and approval along with the preliminary plat application, and shall be filed of record at the county prior to final plat approval in order to ensure that there is an entity in place for long-term maintenance of these improvements (also see subsection 11-3-1(c)(10)e). Said documents must, at a minimum, include provisions that allow the city to take over the maintenance of common property, including but not limited to private streets and private recreation facilities, using association funds, if such action becomes necessary due to nonperformance or inaction by the association or if the association goes defunct. Provisions shall also be included which would, in the latter instance, convey ownership of the private streets (if any) and all other common areas to the city, and which would allow the city to remove any improvements or amenities from the common areas and sell any buildable land area, as residential lots, to recoup the city's expenses for maintenance or demolition of the improvements. Any monies that remain after the city has recovered all of its expenses shall be retained for future maintenance or upgrading of the streets, common areas (if any remain), screening walls, or other improvements within the subdivision. These provisions are not intended to allow the city to profit in any way from taking over the association's responsibilities or funds; they are only intended to allow the city to recoup its actual incurred expenses such that the general public, the taxpayers of the city, does not have to bear these costs. 
(b)  Membership. A property owners or homeowners association shall be an incorporated nonprofit organization operating under recorded land agreements through which: 
(1)  Each lot owner within the described land area is automatically a mandatory member; and 
(2)  Each lot is automatically subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the expenses for the property owners or homeowners association's activities, such as maintenance of common open spaces or private streets, or the provision and upkeep of common recreational facilities. 
(c)  Legal requirements. In order to assure the establishment of a proper property owners or homeowners association, including its financing, and the rights and responsibilities of the property or home owners in relation to the use, management and ownership of common property, the subdivision plat, dedication documents, covenants, and other recorded legal agreements must: 
(1)  Legally create an automatic membership, nonprofit property owners or homeowners association; 
(2)  Place title to the common property in the property owners or homeowners association, or give definite assurance that it automatically will be so placed within a reasonable, definite time; 
(3)  Appropriately limit the uses of the common property; 
(4)  Give each lot owner the right to the use and enjoyment of the common property; 
(5)  Place responsibility for operation and maintenance of the common property in the property owners or homeowners association; 
(6)  Place an association charge on each lot in a manner which will both assure sufficient association funds and which will provide adequate safeguards for the lot owners against undesirable high charges; 
(7)  Give each lot owner voting rights in the association; and 
(8)  Must identify land area within the association's jurisdiction including but not limited to the following: 
a.  Property to be transferred to public agencies; 
b.  The individual residential lots; 
c.  The common properties to be transferred by the developer to the property owners or homeowners association; and 
d.  Other parcels. 
(9)  Any governmental authority or agency, including, but not limited to, the city and the county, their agents, and employees, shall have the right of immediate access to the common elements at all times if necessary for the preservation of public health, safety and welfare. Should the property owners or homeowners association fail to maintain the common elements to city specifications for an unreasonable time, not to exceed 90 days after written request to do so, then the city shall have the same right, power and authority to enforce the association's rules and to levy assessments necessary to maintain the common elements. The city may elect to exercise the rights and powers of the property owners or homeowners association or its board, or to take any action required and levy any assessment that the property owners or homeowners association might have taken, either in the name of the property owners or homeowners association or otherwise, to cover the cost of maintenance (or the possible demolition, if such becomes necessary to preserve public safety or to ease maintenance burden) of any common elements. 
(d)  Protective covenants. Protective covenants shall be developed which, among other things, shall make the property owners or homeowners association responsible for: 
(1)  The maintenance and operation of all common property; 
(2)  The enforcement of all other covenants; 
(3)  The administration of architectural controls (optional); and 
(4)  Certain specified exterior maintenance of exterior improvements of individual properties (optional). 
The city is not responsible (i.e., has no jurisdiction) for enforcing protective covenants or deed restrictions. 
(e)  The association may not be dissolved without the prior written consent of the city council. 
(f)  No portion of the association documents pertaining to the maintenance of private streets and alleys, and assessments therefore, may be amended without the written consent of the city council.

(3)  Use of park fees. 
a.  A special fund known as the park development fund will be established for the deposit of all fees under this ordinance. 
b.  Fees collected shall be used for the purpose of acquisition and development of new community parks and existing park facilities intended for use and access by the entire city. Fees collected may be used for site preparation, the extension of utilities to or within sites, the installation of landscaping, play equipment, or recreation improvements and attendant engineering and planning costs associated with such park development. 
c.  All expenditures of fees collected shall be made in accordance with the Weatherford 2002 Parks and Recreation Open Space Master Plan and approved by the city council to best benefit the citizens of Weatherford. 
d.  Any monies paid into this park development fund must be expended by the City of Weatherford within ten years from the date received by the city. If such funds are not expended within ten years following final plat approval, the property owner shall be entitled to a refund of such funds upon written request, less any amounts expended for such purposes.

The construction of all of the improvements required in this ordinance shall conform to the latest edition of the city's TCSS, as may be amended, and to any other applicable city standards. 
(e)  Changes or amendments to the TCSS and other construction or design documents. The Technical Construction Standards and Specifications (TCSS) will, from time to time, require revisions and updates to allow for changing construction technology. When changes are required, the TCSS may be amended by separate ordinance. It is the applicant's responsibility to be aware of, and to conform with, all TCSS requirements (including amendments) that are in place as of the time a complete development application for a preliminary plat (including required engineering/construction plans) is received by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  5.1, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-5-2. - Monuments. 
(a)  In all subdivisions and additions, monuments shall be established at the corner of each block in the subdivision consisting of an iron rod or pipe not less than one-half inch in diameter and 18 inches deep, and set flush with the top of the ground. Lot corner monuments shall be placed at all lot corners except corners which are also block corners, consisting of iron rods or pipes of a diameter of not less than one-half inch and 18 inches deep, and set flush with the top of the ground. In addition, curve point markers shall be established of the same specifications as lot corners. Each block corner monument shall include a cap with the surveyor's name and registration number attached to it. All block corners shall be installed prior to the final inspection of the subdivision by the city. Lot corners shall be installed prior to issuance of a building permit. 
(b)  A subdivision shall have at least two concrete monuments set by the surveyor, if not already existing, for two corners of the subdivision, and such concrete monuments shall be located at opposite ends (or at widely separated corners) of the subdivision and clearly shown on the final plat prior to filing at the county. The final plat shall also show clear ties to existing concrete monuments in the vicinity of the subdivision. The design and installation of concrete monuments shall be in accordance with the city's TCSS. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  5.2, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-5-3. - Street lights. 
    All street lighting shall be in keeping with the "semi-rural" atmosphere of Weatherford, and shall be in conformance with the city's TCSS, "dark sky" lighting ordinance (when and if enacted), and any other applicable city codes. Street lighting shall be of a design that casts light downward to the greatest extent possible, and shall minimize light overspill onto adjacent properties. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  5.3, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-5-4. - Street names and signs. 
(a)  Street names must be submitted to the city for review and approval in accordance with the city's guidelines for the naming of streets. The city shall forward all proposed street names to others for review, including the U.S. Postal Service, NCTCOG, and any other applicable emergency service providers. Proposed street names shall be submitted for review along with (and as a part of) the preliminary plat application, and shall become fixed at the time of approval of the preliminary plat. On the final plat, street names shall not be changed from those that were approved on the preliminary plat unless special circumstances have caused the major realignment of streets or a proposed street name(s) is discovered to have already been used elsewhere in the city (or some other similar eventuality). If additional street names are needed for the final plat, then they must be submitted for review and approval by the city, the U.S. Postal Service, and applicable emergency service providers, including 911 dispatch, along with the final plat application. A fee may be established by the city for the changing of street names after approval of the preliminary plat. 
(b)  Surnames of people or the names of corporations or businesses shall not be used as street names, unless approved by the city council. The city will maintain a list of existing street names (and "reserved" street names that have been approved on a preliminary plat), and will update the list as new streets are platted. 
(c)  New street names shall not duplicate existing street names either literally or in a subtle manner (for example, Smith Street vs. Smythe Street; Oak Drive vs. Oak Place vs. Oak Court vs. Oak Circle; Cascade Drive vs. Cascading Drive); shall not be so similar as to cause confusion between names (for example, Lakeside Drive vs. Lake Side Drive vs. Lake Siding Drive); and shall not sound like existing street names when spoken (for example, Oak Drive vs. Doak Drive vs. Cloak Drive; Lantern Way vs. Land Tern Way). 
(d)  New streets that extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. Streets crossing thoroughfares or other roadways shall bear the same name on both sides of the thoroughfare, wherever practical, unless otherwise approved by city council. 
(e)  The property owner shall provide payment for street name signs for the development. The cost of each street name sign installation shall include the cost of the sign assembly, pole and all costs associated with installation. Payment by the property owner will be due prior to acceptance of the subdivision by the city. 
(f)  Street name signs shall be installed in accordance with the city's guidelines before issuance of a building permit for any structure on the streets approved within the subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  5.4, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-5-5. - Street and alley improvements. 
(a)  All onsite, such as internal, streets and alleys shall be constructed by the developer at the developer's expense, unless otherwise allowed by this ordinance. If the subdivision is adjacent to a planned or future or substandard arterial or collector street, as shown on the city's thoroughfare plan, and derives access, whether direct or indirect, from said roadway, then the developer shall be required to design and construct a reasonable portion of the roadway as well as any required median openings and left turn lanes needed to serve his or her subdivision (see section 11-5-9). The city council may, at its option, accept escrow funds in lieu of immediate roadway construction if the subdivision derives principal access from another improved roadway and if delaying construction or improvement of the road will not harm or otherwise inconvenience neighboring property owners or the general public. 
(b)  All streets and alleys shall be constructed using reinforced concrete, unless otherwise approved by the city council, and per the specifications in the city's TCSS. 
(c)  The minimum street and alley paving standards for which the construction shall be made by the developer are shown in the TCSS. 
(d)  In addition to the above mentioned minimum standards, barrier-free ramps for physically challenged persons shall be constructed at all street corners, driveway approaches, appropriate mid-block crosswalks, and in locations where accessible parking spaces are provided. All barrier-free ramps and other accessibility considerations shall comply with Section 228 of the Highway Safety Act, as currently amended, and with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended. 
(e)  All signs and barricades shall be in conformity with the TCSS, with ADA standards, and with specifications for uniform traffic control devices, as adopted by the city, by Parker County, by the Texas Department of Transportation, and by the Texas Department of Public Safety, as applicable. 
(f)  Approval is required prior to the installation of any driveway connecting to a public street. The city engineer shall approve all driveway cuts. The minimum distance, as measured from the edge or curb to the edge or curb of driveways, and not from the centerlines of the driveways, between driveway openings for multi-family and nonresidential developments shall be as set forth in the city's TCSS manual, unless otherwise approved by city council. Driveways shall not be within the transition or stacking portion of a right turn lane, and shall be no closer than 100 feet to an intersecting thoroughfare or arterial street, as measured from the intersecting street's end of curb radius, and no closer than 50 feet to an intersecting residential or collector street. Residential driveways shall not be allowed on a major roadway (type "C" or above on the city's thoroughfare plan). 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  5.5, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-5-6. - Retaining wall requirements, construction regulations, and design criteria. 
(a)  Retaining wall requirements. In general, the use of retaining walls shall be minimized, wherever possible, through minimal and balanced cut and fill on property. When property within or directly adjacent to a subdivision contains changes in elevation exceeding two and one-half feet and the slope exceeds one unit vertical in two units horizontal, a retaining wall shall be required at the locations specified herein prior to the acceptance of the subdivision: 
(1)  Location A. The grade change roughly follows a side or rear lot line. 
(2)  Location B. The grade change is adjacent to a proposed building site boundary. 
(3)  Location C. The grade change is adjacent to a water course or drainage easement. 
(b)  Retaining wall design and construction. All retaining wall design and construction shall be in compliance with the provisions of the building code and the TCSS of the City of Weatherford, and shall be approved by the city engineer. 
(c)  Retaining wall maintenance. Retaining walls shall be maintained by the owner of the property where such retaining wall is located. 
(d)  Retaining walls shall not be constructed within any portion of a utility or drainage easement, unless approved by the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  5.6, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-5-7. - Screening and landscaping construction regulations, requirements and design criteria. 
(a)  Screening. 
(1)  Where subdivisions are platted so that the rear and/or side yards of single-family or two-family residential lots are adjacent to an arterial thoroughfare (greater than 60 feet in right-of-way width on the thoroughfare plan); a four lane collector street; are separated from a thoroughfare by an alley; or back up to a collector or residential street (which is not allowed unless specifically approved by city council), the developer shall provide, at his or her sole expense, a minimum six-foot tall masonry screening wall (also see subsection (7) below), or some other alternative form of screening, if approved by city council, according to the following alternatives and standards. All screening shall be adjacent to the right-of-way or property line and fully located on the private lot(s), including columns and decorative features. All forms of screening shall conform to the requirements of city ordinances and policies that govern sight distance for traffic safety. 
(2)  Screening alternatives. Screening shall be provided in accordance with, and shall be constructed to, standards and criteria as set forth in the city's TCSS and other related city code(s) and policy(s). An alternative form of screening, in lieu of the six- to eight-foot tall masonry wall, may be approved by city council on a landscaping/screening wall plan submitted with the preliminary plat application. Such possible alternatives may include, but may not be limited to, the following: 
a.  Living/landscaped screen with decorative metal (e.g., wrought iron) fence sections with masonry columns; 
b.  A combination of berms and living/landscaped screening, either with or without a decorative metal or "WoodCrete" type of fence with masonry columns; 
c.  A combination of berms, decorative masonry retaining walls (no taller than six feet in height where facing or visible to a public street) and living/landscaped screening, either with or without a decorative metal or "WoodCrete" type of fence with masonry columns; or 
d.  Some other creative screening alternative may be approved if it meets the spirit and intent of this section, if it is demonstrated to be long lasting and generally maintenance-free, and if the city council finds it to be in the public interest to approve the alternative screening device. 
Any required screening device shall be, or shall achieve, at least six feet in height and at least 90 percent opacity within three years of initial installation/planting. Any landscaping used to achieve the purpose of required screening shall be equipped with an underground irrigation system with appropriate double-check valve(s), automatic controller(s), and automatic moisture- and freeze-sensors. Trees used for overstory screening shall be on a separate bubbler irrigation system that can be programmed to provide deep-watering of trees at intervals that may differ from the rest of the irrigation system. 
The use of wood or other privacy fences immediately behind or abutting an alternative screening device that utilizes living screening elements (i.e., landscaping), berms, retaining walls and/or open (i.e., nonopaque) fence sections shall not be permitted due to the creation of a "no man's land" and subsequent maintenance nuisance in the area between the two devices/fences, and due to the detrimental visual appearance of this type of arrangement. 
The use of any alternative form of screening in lieu of the masonry wall, particularly a device utilizing landscaping, shall require formation of a property/homeowners' association in accordance with section 11-4-3 of this ordinance. 
(3)  A wall/screening maintenance easement at least five feet in width shall be dedicated to the city or to a property owners association on the private lot side and adjacent to the entire length of the screening wall or device. 
(4)  The screening wall/device shall be installed prior to approval of the final plat and prior to final acceptance of the subdivision (or appropriate surety provided, per article VI of this ordinance). Landscape materials may be installed after the subdivision is accepted, upon approval of the city manager/mayor (or designee), but in no case later than six months following acceptance of the subdivision. Failure to properly install all components of a required screening wall or device within the allowed time frame, and without the appropriate developer's agreement and surety, shall constitute a violation of this ordinance and the developer may be subject to a penalty pursuant to the City's Code of Ordinances. 
(5)  All plants, such as trees, shrubs and ground covers, shall be living and in sound, healthy, vigorous and growing condition, and they shall be of a size, fullness and height that is customary for their container or ball size, as per the latest edition of the "American Standard for Nursery Stock", by the American Association of Nurserymen, as may be amended. 
(6)  All masonry, wrought iron, steel or aluminum screening wall or fence plans and details must be designed and sealed by a licensed professional engineer, and must be approved by the city engineer. Masonry walls shall be in accordance with the city's design standards, and the use of "thin wall" type of construction is greatly discouraged (and may be disallowed altogether) due to problems with inferior strength and the higher cost of long-term maintenance. Decorative metal fencing shall be solid stock, not tubular, and shall have masonry columns at a minimum spacing of 100 feet on center. 
(7)  The height of required screening devices, including spans between columns, shall be a minimum of six feet and shall be no more than eight feet tall. Decorative columns, pilasters, stone caps, sculptural elements, and other similar features may exceed the maximum eight-foot height by up to two feet for a total maximum height of ten feet for these features, provided that such taller elements comprise no more than ten percent of the total wall length in elevation view. Features that are taller than ten feet in height shall require city council approval on the landscaping/screening plans submitted with the preliminary plat. 
(8)  Screening fences, walls and devices shall not be constructed within any portion of a utility or drainage easement unless specifically authorized by the city and by any other applicable utility provider(s). 
(b)  Entryway features (neighborhood identification). 
(1)  Subdivisions in excess of ten platted lots may provide a low maintenance landscaped entryway feature at access points from streets and thoroughfares into the subdivision. The entryway feature shall be placed on private property and within an easement identified for such use (limited portions of the feature or landscaping may be placed within the right-of-way, but only with city council approval on the landscaping/screening plans), and shall observe all sight visibility requirements. Most of the feature or landscaping shall be located on private property so that long-term maintenance responsibility will be borne by the property owner or an approved homeowners association (see section 11-4-3). Entryway features that are located mostly or entirely within city right-of-way shall only be allowed with city council approval. Prior to city council approval, the city may require the applicant to execute an agreement with the city that relieves the city of maintenance responsibility and that indemnifies and holds the city harmless for damage or injury incurred by or in conjunction with such features in the right-of-way. 
(2)  Design requirements. The entryway feature shall include low maintenance, living landscaped materials as approved by the city council. The design of the entryway feature shall also include an automatic underground irrigation system that is equipped with moisture- and freeze-sensors, and may also include subdivision identification, such as signage located on the wall. All plants shall be living and in a sound, healthy, vigorous and growing condition, and they shall be of a size, fullness and height that is customary for their container or ball size, as per the latest edition of the "American Standard for Nursery Stock", by the American Association of Nurserymen, as may be amended. Any walls or structures used in the entryway feature must conform to the city's regulations pertaining to maximum height within the front yard of residential lots (see the zoning ordinance) wherever the adjacent lot sides onto the arterial street and the wall will be located within the front yard setback area. 
(3)  The design of the entryway shall be in accordance with design policies in the city's TCSS. The design of the entry shall be reflected on the landscape, screening and irrigation plans submitted along with the engineering plans and the preliminary plat, and shall be approved by the city council. 
(4)  The maintenance of the entryway shall be the responsibility of the applicant for a period of at least two years or until building permits have been issued for 80 percent of the lots in the subdivision, whichever date is later. Following that period of time, maintenance responsibility shall be borne by the private property owner(s) upon whose lot(s) the entryway feature is located, or by an approved homeowners association (see section 11-4-3). If, at some point in time, the maintenance responsibility shifts to the city, the city shall have the right to upgrade, reduce or eliminate entirely, at its sole option, the landscaping and other amenities in order to simplify or minimize the amount of time, effort and cost that maintenance of the entryway will require. 
(c)  Landscaping. All landscaping shall be in conformance with the city's zoning ordinance, as amended. 
(d)  Signage. All signage shall be in conformance with the city's sign ordinance, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  5.7, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-5-8. - Water and wastewater requirements. 
(a)  The installation of all water and wastewater lines shall be in conformance with [section 11-3-9] of this chapter. 
(b)  No final plat shall be approved for any subdivision within the city or its extraterritorial jurisdiction until the applicant has made adequate provision for a water system and a sanitary sewer system of sufficient capacity to adequately provide service to all tracts and lots within the area to be subdivided. The design and construction of the water system and of the sanitary sewer system to serve the subdivision shall be in conformance with the city's master plans for water and wastewater facilities and with the TCSS, and shall be approved by the city engineer (also see section [11-3-9]). 
(c)  Water system with mains of sufficient size and having a sufficient number of outlets to furnish adequate and safe domestic water supply and to furnish fire protection to all lots shall be provided. Water lines shall extend to the property line in order to allow future connections into adjacent undeveloped property, and a box for the water meter(s) for each lot shall be installed either in the right-of-way or immediately adjacent to the right-of-way in a water meter easement. Submetering of water services shall be in accordance with the regulations of the TCEQ. 
(d)  Services for utilities shall be made available to the property line of each lot in such a manner as will minimize the necessity for disturbing the street pavement and drainage structures when connections are made. 
(e)  Fire protection shall be provided in accordance with [section 11-3-9], with the city's TCSS manual, and with any other city policy or ordinance pertaining to fire protection or suppression. The fire chief shall have the authority to approve the locations and placement of all fire hydrants and fire lanes and he or she may, at his or her discretion, modify fire hydrant spacing or fire lane placement based upon special design or distance circumstances. All required fire lanes shall be shown as "fire lane easements" on the construction and final plats, along with the applicable fire lane language block. Vertical construction (i.e., any building construction above foundation/slab level) shall not commence until all required fire lanes are properly installed and accepted by the city, nor until all fire hydrants have been installed, inspected, tested and accepted by the city. Should a developer be granted approval to use private water wells, the developer will still be responsible to provide fire protection in accordance with [section 11-3-9], with the city's TCSS manual, and with any other city policy or ordinance pertaining to fire protection or suppression. 
(f)  Pro rata reimbursement. Where water or sewer mains, lift stations, force mains or other water or sewer facilities are installed by a developer, the developer may be entitled to reimbursement of the cost of such facilities from pro rata charges paid by persons connecting to or making use of such facilities to serve their property in accordance with the provisions of this section. In no case, however, shall a developer receive reimbursement in excess of the cost of the facilities. Pro rata agreements will expire in ten years from city acceptance of the facilities. 
(1)  Reimbursement for lift stations or force mains. Reimbursement to developers for the cost of lift stations or force mains shall be as follows: 
a.  Any developer who bears the cost of lift stations or force mains to serve a development may be entitled to reimbursement for such costs from pro rata connection charges paid to the city, in accordance with this section, by any person who makes use of such lift stations or force mains within ten years of the date such facilities are accepted by the city. 
b.  The maximum reimbursable cost paid to a developer by the city from pro rata charges collected from persons connecting to the facilities constructed by a developer shall be based upon the cost of providing capacity for the facilities in excess of the capacity required or reserved by the developer to meet the requirements of the developer's property for which the facilities were installed, as specified in the TCSS. A developer seeking reimbursement through a pro rata agreement shall be financially responsible for the minimum line size for both water and sewer lines, as specified in the TCSS. 
c.  Reimbursement costs shall be payable to the developer within 90 days of receipt of pro rata charges collected by the city. 
d.  Prior to the beginning of construction of any facility for which reimbursement is provided for herein, the developer shall enter into a written pro rata reimbursement agreement with the city. The agreement shall be in a form approved by the city. In addition to such other terms as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, the agreement shall provide that if construction of the facility does not commence within one year of the date of the agreement, it shall terminate, unless a written extension thereof is approved by both parties. 
(2)  Pro rata charges for use of sanitary sewer lift stations or force mains installed by developers. Persons connecting to or using sanitary sewer lift stations or force mains installed by a developer shall pay pro rata costs as follows: 
a.  Every person who connects to or makes use of a sanitary sewer lift station or force main, the cost of which has been incurred by a developer and for which a pro rata reimbursement agreement has been entered into between the city and such developer, shall, as a condition to such connection or use or continued use, pay to the city pro rata cost charge based upon the use of the excess capacity of the facility, as specified in the TCSS. 
b.  The intent of this subsection is to provide for an equitable pro rata charge to persons making use of lift stations or force mains constructed under the provisions of this section based upon the average daily projected sewage flows and peak sewage flows of particular buildings, structures and land uses. 
c.  In cases where the pro rata charge calculated in accordance with this subsection would not be equitable because the actual average daily sewage flow or peak flow from a particular building, structure or land use is much greater or smaller than the normal projected average daily flow or peak flow on which such pro rata charge is based, the director of utilities may, based upon evidence of such greater or smaller actual daily sewage flow or peak flow, require a payment of a greater or smaller pro rata charge as a condition to the connection to, use of or continued use of a lift station or force main that is subject to a pro rata reimbursement agreement. In such cases, the director of utilities shall give written notice to such person required to make such pro rata payment of the basis for the actual pro rata charge, and such person may, within 30 days thereafter, appeal such determination to the public utility board. The board shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, make a determination of the actual pro rata charge to be assessed and paid.

Sec. 11-5-9. - Improvement of adjacent (perimeter) streets and utilities. 
(a)  When a proposed subdivision, whether residential or nonresidential, abuts on one or both sides of an existing substandard street, or on a planned or future road as shown on the thoroughfare plan, being substandard according to the then existing current thoroughfare plan, the developer shall be required to improve his or her reasonable share of the existing onsite facility as that term is defined herein, including appurtenant sidewalks, barrier-free ramps, screening and landscaping, median openings and/or left turn lanes (if a divided thoroughfare), storm drainage structures, water quality or erosion controls, and other utilities as defined in section 11-1-13, to bring the same to city standards, or to replace it with a standard city street as determined by the traffic impact analysis, if required, at no cost to the city. 
(b)  The developer's share of improvements to a substandard perimeter road shall be 181/2 of pavement (including curb, if any), which is approximately equivalent to half of a collector street width (i.e., two through traffic lanes), along the entire front footage of the subdivision, unless the traffic impact analysis, if required, indicates that some other pavement width is needed to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of service on the roadway. If the subdivision is to be located on both sides of the roadway, 181/2 feet of pavement shall be constructed by the developer on each side of the road along the entire front footage of the subdivision on each respective side of the road, unless the traffic impact analysis determines otherwise. Design and construction of the roadway shall be in accordance with the city's thoroughfare plan (with respect to right-of-way width and general location, the TCSS manual, and with any other applicable city codes and ordinances. Depending upon the specific roadway in question, and upon the traffic impact analysis results, any oversizing above the 181/2 width shall be borne by the city, the county, the state or by some other entity. The city council may, at its option, accept escrow funds in lieu of immediate roadway construction if the subdivision derives principal access from another improved roadway and if delaying construction and improvement of the road will not harm or otherwise inconvenience neighboring property owners or the general public. 
(c)  Streets which dead-end at power lines or similar rights-of-way or easements, and which are intended for future extension across these rights-of-way or easements, shall be constructed in the right-of-way or easement for half the distance across the right-of-way or easement, and shall be further restricted as set forth in section 11-3-1 of this ordinance. As with any other dead-end street, a note shall be placed on the final plat clearly labeling the dead-end streets that will, at some point, be extended across the power line easement (or right-of-way), and signage shall be placed at the end of the constructed street stub, such as on the barricade, also stating that the street will be extended in the future. Signage size and lettering shall be large enough to be legible by a person with normal vision at a distance of 20 feet. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  5.9, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-5-10. - Storm drainage and water quality controls. 
(a)  An adequate storm sewer system consisting of inlets, pipes and other underground structures with approved outlets shall be constructed where runoff of storm water and the prevention of erosion cannot be accomplished satisfactorily by surface drainage facilities. Areas subject to flood conditions or inadvertent storm water retention, such as standing or pooling water, as established by the city engineer, will not be considered for development until adequate drainage has been provided. 
(b)  The criteria for use in designing storm sewers, culverts, bridges, drainage channels, and drainage facilities shall conform to section 11-3-10 of this ordinance. In no case shall drainage areas be diverted artificially to adjacent properties or across roadways. Storm water drainage from one lot onto another shall not be allowed unless such does not pose any harm or inconvenience to the downstream property owner(s), unless specifically approved by the city engineer, and unless the necessary offsite drainage easement is procured on the affected property(s). 
(c)  The developer shall ensure that all drainage improvements within public easements or rights-of-way are functioning properly prior to the expiration of the maintenance bond. The developer shall be responsible for removing any significant build-up of sediment or debris from drainage improvements, with the exception of backlot and sidelot drainage swales, at the eleventh month of the second year for the required two-year maintenance bond for the applicable facilities. The city shall inspect the improvements to determine any maintenance or correction of deficiencies at the conclusion of this period.

(b)  Improvement agreement and guarantee. The city council may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approval of the final plat, and may permit the property owner to enter into an improvement agreement by which the property owner covenants to complete all required public improvements no later than two years following the date upon which the final plat is approved. The city council may also require the property owner to complete or dedicate some of the required public improvements prior to approval of the final plat, and to enter into an improvement agreement for completion of the remainder of the required improvements during such two-year period. The improvement agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions as are agreed to by the property owner and the city. Specifically, all improvement agreements shall require the property owner(s) to conform to the appropriate bid procedures as mandated for the City of Weatherford by the city's official policies and procedures, the Weatherford City Charter, and the Texas Local Government Code. 
(c)  Improvement agreement required for oversize reimbursement. The city shall require an improvement agreement pertaining to any public improvement for which the developer shall request reimbursement from the city for oversize costs. The city council, as it deems appropriate and after consideration by the Weatherford Municipal Utilities Board for water, wastewater and electric utilities, has the authority to authorize the approval of such agreement as meeting the requirements of the city, and the city shall not withhold approval as a means of avoiding compensation due under the terms of this ordinance. The city manager/mayor (or designee) is authorized to sign an improvement agreement on behalf of the city. The improvement agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions as are agreed to by the property owner and the city. Specifically, all improvement agreements shall require the property owner(s) to conform to the appropriate bid procedures as mandated for the City of Weatherford by the city's official policies and procedures, the Weatherford City Charter, and the Texas Local Government Code. 
(d)  Security. Whenever the city permits an applicant to enter into an improvement agreement, it shall require the applicant to provide sufficient security, covering the completion of the public improvements. The security shall be in the form of cash escrow or, where authorized by the city, a performance bond or letter of credit or other security acceptable to the city council and the city attorney, as security for the promises contained in the improvement agreement. Security shall be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the estimated cost of completion of the required public improvements and lot improvements. The issuer of any surety bond and letter of credit shall be subject to the approval of the city manager/mayor and the city attorney. 
(e)  Performance bond. If the city council authorizes the applicant to post a performance bond as security for its promises contained in the improvement agreement, the performance bond shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  All performance bonds must be in the forms acceptable to the city manager/mayor and the city attorney; 
(2)  All performance bonds must be executed by such sureties as are named in the current list of "Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies", as published in Circular 570, as may be amended, by the Financial Management Service, Surety Bond Branch, U.S. Department of the Treasury; 
(3)  All performance bonds must be signed by an agent, and must be accompanied by a certified copy of the authority for him or her to act; 
(4)  All performance bonds shall be obtained from surety or insurance companies that are duly licensed or authorized in the State of Texas to issue performance bonds for the limits and coverage required. 
If the surety on any performance bond furnished by the applicant is declared bankrupt, or becomes insolvent, or its right to do business in terminated in the State of Texas, or the surety ceases to meet the requirements listed in Circular 570, the developer shall, within 20 calendar days thereafter, substitute another performance bond and surety, both of which must be acceptable to the city. 
(f)  Letter of credit. If the city council authorizes the applicant to post a letter of credit as security for its promises contained in the improvement agreement, the letter of credit shall: 
(1)  Be irrevocable; 
(2)  Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods, but in no event less than two years; and 
(3)  Require only that the city present the issuer with a sight draft and a certificate signed by an authorized representative of the city certifying to the city's right to draw funds under the letter of credit. 
(g)  As portions of the public improvements are completed in accordance with the TCSS and the approved engineering plans, the applicant may make written application to the city manager/mayor to reduce the amount of the original security. If the city manager/mayor is satisfied that such portion of the improvements has been completed in accordance with city standards, he or she may, but is not required to, cause the amount of the security to be reduced by such amount that he or she deems appropriate, so that the remaining amount of the security adequately insures the completion of the remaining public improvements. 
(h)  Upon acceptance by the city of all required public improvements, the city shall authorize a reduction in the security to ten percent of the original amount of the security if the applicant is not in breach of the improvement agreement. The remaining security shall be security for the applicant's covenant to maintain the required public improvements and to warrant that the improvements are free from defects for two years thereafter. If the required security for maintenance and warranty is otherwise provided by the contractors or by others, the city will release the entire amount of the developer's security. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  6.2, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-6-3. - Temporary improvements. 
(a)  The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the city, and shall maintain those temporary improvements for the period specified by the city. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the applicant shall file with the city a separate improvement agreement and escrow or, where authorized, a letter of credit, in an appropriate amount for temporary facilities, which agreement and escrow or letter of credit shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed. 
(b)  Any temporary public improvement (e.g., a temporary cul-de-sac, alley turnout, drainage swale, erosion control device, etc.) shall be placed within an easement established specifically for that purpose. The recording information of the instrument establishing the temporary easement shall be clearly shown on the final plat for the subdivision prior to approval of the final plat. A temporary easement for a required public improvement shall not be abandoned without the city engineer's approval and without written consent by the city.

Sec. 11-6-5. - Failure to complete improvements. 
(a)  For plats for which no improvement agreement has been executed and no security has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed within the period specified by the city, the plat approvals shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where an improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted, and the required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of the agreement, the city may: 
(1)  Declare the agreement to be in default and require that all the public improvements be installed regardless of the extent of completion of the development at the time the agreement is declared to be in default;

Sec. 11-6-6. - Acceptance of dedication offers. 
(a)  Acceptance of formal offers for the dedication of streets, public areas, easements or parks shall be by authorization of the city manager/mayor (or designee). The approval by the city council of a preliminary or final plat shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the city of any street, public area, easement or park shown on the plat. The city may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  6.6, 9-10-02)

Sec. 11-6-8. - Construction procedures. 
(a)  A site development permit is required from the city prior to beginning any site development-related work in the city or its extraterritorial jurisdiction that affects erosion control, storm drainage, vegetation or tree removal, or a flood plain. 
(b)  Preconstruction conference. Prior to scheduling the preconstruction conference, the engineering plans must be complete and an inspection fee equal to four percent of the public infrastructure construction cost must be submitted to the community development department with an executed copy of the contract and an itemized cost for the public infrastructure portion of the improvements. The itemized cost shall be broken down into water, sanitary sewer, streets, and drainage and sidewalk improvements. The city shall require that all contractors participating in the construction meet for a preconstruction conference to discuss the project prior to release of a grading permit and before any filling, excavation, clearing or removal of vegetation and any trees that are larger than six-inch caliper. All contractors shall be familiar with, and shall conform to, applicable provisions of the city's landscape ordinance and tree protection/preservation ordinance (when adopted into the city's zoning ordinance).

Sec. 11-6-9. - Inspection and acceptance of public improvements. 
(a)  General procedure. Periodic construction inspections as required by the city shall be conducted by an independent, duly qualified firm engaged by the property owner. Said inspections shall ensure that construction is in accordance with the approved construction plans and the TCSS of the City of Weatherford (and other applicable codes and ordinances). Upon completion of each inspection, a written report shall be forwarded to the city that fully documents the inspection conducted, the tests completed, specific items that are in compliance or noncompliance, actions that must be taken to bring the construction into compliance, and any other information required by the city engineer. The City of Weatherford may either require reinspection by the applicant's independent firm or conduct its own independent inspection as required by the city engineer. 
(b)  Letter of satisfactory completion and submission of record drawings. The city will not deem required public improvements satisfactorily completed until the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the city engineer, through submission of detailed sealed record drawings of the property which indicate all public improvements and their locations, dimensions, materials and other information required by the city engineer, and until all required public improvements have been completed. The record drawings shall be sealed drawings of the paving, drainage, water, sanitary sewer and other public improvements, showing that the layout of the lines and grades of all public improvements are in accordance with engineering plans for the plat, and showing all changes made in the plans during construction, and containing on each sheet a "record drawing" stamp bearing the signature and seal of the licensed professional engineer and the date. One reproducible drawing of the utility plan sheets containing the as-built information shall also be submitted. The engineer or surveyor shall also furnish the city with a copy of the approved final plat and the engineering plans, if prepared on a computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) system, in such a digital format (on disk) that is compatible with the city engineer's CADD system. When such requirements have been met to the city engineer's satisfaction, the city manager/mayor (or designee) shall thereafter make a recommendation to the city council for consideration of satisfactory completion of the public improvements. Once the city council votes its approval of satisfactory completion, the city manager/mayor (or designee) shall issue the letter of satisfactory completion. 
    Acceptance of the development shall mean that the developer has transferred all rights to all the public improvements to the city for use and maintenance. The city council may, at its option, accept dedication of a portion of the required public improvements if the remaining public improvements are not immediately required for health and safety reasons, and if the property owner has posted a performance bond, letter of credit or cash bond in the amount of 100 percent of the estimated cost of those remaining improvements for a length of time to be determined by the city council. If the remaining public improvements are greater than $10,000.00 and are not completed within the determined length of time, the city will impose a penalty that equals ten percent of the performance bond, letter of credit, or cash bond. The obligation to complete the improvements remains with the developer, and all future building permits or certificates of occupancy will be withheld until the improvements are complete. If the remaining public improvements are less than $10,000.00, the developer shall pay the actual dollar amount. The length of time may be extended due to inclement weather or unforeseen delays by mutual agreement between the developer and the city. 
    Upon acceptance of the required public improvements, the city manager/mayor (or designee) shall submit a certificate to the developer stating that all required public improvements have been satisfactorily completed. 
(Ord. No. 2002-22,  6.9, 9-10-02) 
Sec. 11-6-10. - Deferral of required improvements. 
(a)  The city council may, upon petition of the property owner and favorable recommendation of the city engineer, defer at the time of plat approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all public improvements as, in its judgment, are not required in the immediate interests of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  Whenever a petition to defer the construction of any public improvements required under this ordinance is granted by the city council, the property owner shall deposit in escrow his or her share of the costs (in accordance with city participation and oversizing policies of the future public improvements with the city prior to approval of the plat, or the property owner may execute a separate improvement agreement secured by a cash escrow or, where authorized, a letter of credit guaranteeing completion of the deferred public improvements upon demand of the city.

Sec. 11-6-11. - Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy. 
(a)  No building permit shall be issued for a lot, building site, building or use unless the lot or building site has been officially recorded by a final plat approved by the city council, and unless all public improvements, as required by this ordinance for final plat approval, have been completed, except as may be permitted below: 
(1)  A building "foundation only" permit may be issued for a nonresidential or multi-family development provided that a preliminary plat has been approved by the city council, and provided that the engineering plans have been released by the city engineer. However, the building permit shall not be issued and building construction shall not be allowed to surpass the construction of fire protection improvements. In other words, the building shall not proceed above the slab level until all required fire lanes have been completed, and until all water lines serving fire hydrants have been completed, inspected and tested. 
(2)  The city building official may release some residential building permits for not more than ten percent of the lots within a new residential subdivision, provided that a preliminary plat has been approved by the city council and the engineering plans have been approved by the city engineer, and provided that all public improvements have been completed for that portion of the development including, but not limited to, those required for fire and emergency protection, such as streets providing at least two points of emergency access, alleys, water lines serving fire hydrants, and other similar, required public safety improvements. No lot may be sold nor title conveyed until the final plat has been approved by the city council and recorded at Parker County. 
(3)  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building or the use of property unless all subdivision improvements have been completed and a final plat has been approved and recorded at the county.

CHAPTER 2. - ZONING PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION 

Sec. 12-2-1. - Zoning upon annexation. 
(a)  As soon as practical following annexation of property by the city, the city manager or property owners of the annexed area, shall initiate proceedings to establish Agricultural ("AG") or another appropriate zoning classification requested by the property owners on the newly annexed territory. Thereupon the city manager shall commence public notification and other standard procedures for zoning amendments as set forth in this ordinance. Said proceedings to establish zoning may be undertaken concurrently with annexation procedures (i.e., notified at the same time, public hearings scheduled at the same time as annexation, etc.), however zoning approval and formal adoption of the ordinance establishing zoning must occur after annexation approval and adoption have occurred, and as a separate and distinct action by the city council. 
(b)  The initial zoning of a tract, whether it is interim in nature, by initiation of the landowner or by initiation of the city, must meet the requirements for notification and public hearings as set forth in this ordinance and all other applicable state laws. 
(c)  The owner of land to be annexed may submit an application for zoning the property simultaneously with submission of the petition for annexation, but no such annexation application may be made conditioned upon the approval of any particular zoning classification. 
(d)  Within an area classified as "AG" (Agricultural): 
(1)  No permit for the construction of a building or use of land shall be issued by the building official other than a permit which will allow the construction of a building or use permitted in the "AG" district, unless and until such territory has been classified in a zoning district other than the "AG" district by the city council in the manner prescribed herein. 
(2)  If plans and preparations for developing a property for a use other than those specified in the "AG" district were already in progress prior to annexation of the property into the city, then the city council may authorize construction of the project by a majority vote. Application of this subsection is contingent upon the following: 
a.  An application for a building permit for the proposed building or use must be made to the building official within three months after annexation of the property into the city; and 
b.  The applicant must be able to demonstrate that plans and other preparations for developing the property commenced prior to (i.e., were already in progress at the time of) annexation into the city. 
In its deliberations concerning authorization to proceed with construction of a project which meets the above criteria, the city council shall take into consideration the appropriate land use for the area as shown on the city's future land use plan. Upon approval by the city council, the city manager shall notify the building official of such approval. 
(3)  If the city and the owner of property enter into a development agreement prior to the annexation of the property as provided in Section 212.172, Texas Local Government Code, then the city council may authorize construction of a project in accordance with the terms of the development agreement. 
(Ord. No. 511-2010-49,  1(Exh. A), 1-11-11) 
Sec. 12-2-2. - Nonconforming uses and structures. 
(a)  Nonconforming uses. Where a lawful use of property exists at the effective date of adoption of this ordinance, or any amendment to this ordinance, which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance or amendments to this ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions below: 
(1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. 
(2)  No such nonconforming use shall be increased or extended to occupy additional buildings nor may such nonconforming use be extended throughout any parts of the building not already occupied unless such parts of the building were manifestly arranged or designed for such nonconforming use and were owned or leased by the operator of the nonconforming use on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. 
(3)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any tract or portion thereof other than that occupied by such use on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. 
(4)  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use. 
(5)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a structure used as a nonconforming single-family owner occupied residence which is damaged, destroyed, or deteriorated shall be permitted to be reconstructed without the approval of the zoning board of adjustment regardless of the extent of damage, destruction, or deterioration, provided that the construction complies with all current building codes and is commenced within six months after the date of damage, destruction, or deterioration. The failure of the owner to start such reconstruction within six months shall forfeit the owner's right to restore or reconstruct the dwelling except in conformance with this ordinance. 
(b)  Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yard, site location on the tract, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions below. The provisions in this subsection shall also apply to a structure made nonconforming by governmental action affecting the area, lot coverage, height, yard, site location on the tract, or other requirement concerning structure. 
(1)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(2)  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(3)  Should such nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses of structures and land in combination. Where a lawful use of structures and land in combination exists on the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, or any amendments to this ordinance, that would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance, or amendments to this ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions below. 
(1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
(2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such a building. 
(3)  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure and land may as a special exception be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the board of adjustment, either by general rule or by making finding in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In approving a special exception for such a change, the board of adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(4)  Any structure and land in combination, in which a nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(5)  When a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months, they shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which they are located. 
(6)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the legal nonconforming status of the land. "Destruction" for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction. 
(d)  Repairs and maintenance. 
(1)  On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, ordinary repair and maintenance may be done. No structural alterations in excess of 50 percent of the replacement cost of the structure may be performed. 
(2)  If a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored or rebuilt, except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(3)  Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
(e)  Nonconforming lots. Where an existing legally platted lot exists at the time of adoption of this ordinance, or any amendments to this ordinance, which does not meet the minimum size, length, or width regulations imposed by this ordinance, or amendments to this ordinance, the lot may be developed, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions below. The provisions in this subsection shall also apply to a lot made nonconforming by governmental action affecting the lot size, length or width. 
(1)  The nonconforming lot must have access to a street as required by this ordinance. 
(2)  Any structure developed on the nonconforming lot shall meet the minimum setbacks, height, and use regulations for the district in which it is located. 
(3)  Any variance from the setbacks or height regulations, required in the district in which the nonconforming lot is located, shall be subject to the approval of the board of adjustment. 
(f)  Discontinuance or abandonment. 
(1)  If any nonconforming use of property shall be discontinued or abandoned under the terms and conditions of this subsection, such use shall not be resumed and any subsequent use of the property shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such property is located. The city has determined that discontinuance of a nonconforming use and abandonment of a nonconforming use are separate and distinct acts and the city has established a different standard of review for each act. 
a.  Abandonment shall be defined as an intent by the owner to permanently close or cease the use, coupled with any act or statement by the owner that manifests such intent. The following conditions, events or conduct shall be presumed to constitute an intent to abandon a nonconforming use: 
1.  The closure or cessation of the use for a period of 120 consecutive days; 
2.  In the determination of the director of planning and development, the structure or use is (1) in an advanced stage of dilapidation; (2) is non-compliant with one or more health and safety codes such as the building, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes that govern the use of structures designed for human occupancy; or (3) is otherwise unsafe for the continuation of such use or occupancy. 
If any of these conditions, events or conduct exists, then the owner shall bear the burden of proof and production to establish that the owner did not intend to abandon the use. 
b.  For the purpose of this section, "discontinuance" shall be defined as a closure or cessation of a use for a period of 180 consecutive days, irrespective of whether the owner has an intent to abandon the use. 
When land or a structure that is nonconforming has historically been used only on a seasonal basis, such use shall be deemed to have been discontinued if, irrespective of whether the owner has an intent to abandon the use, either: (1) such use is closed or ceases to operate for a period of 180 consecutive days, or (2) such property is not operated as a nonconforming use in a bonafide manner during such season. 
(2)  Upon evidence of hardship, the board of adjustment shall have the authority to extend the time limits in this subsection for a period not to exceed one year. 
(g)  Additional provisions regarding nonconforming uses. 
(1)  No nonconforming accessory use or structure shall continue after the principal use or structure shall have ceased or terminated unless the accessory use or structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(2)  The foregoing provisions of this section shall also apply to uses that are allowed to commence or continue under Section 43.002, Texas Local Government Code, and are thereby made nonconforming upon annexation into the city limits. 
(3)  The foregoing provisions of this section shall also apply to uses that do not conform to the provisions of this ordinance but are permitted after the adoption of this ordinance based on previously adopted regulations applicable to such uses as required by Section 245.002, Texas Local Government Code. 
(Ord. No. 511-2010-49,  1(Exh. A), 1-11-11; Ord. No. 934-2018-49 , Exh. A, 10-23-18) 
Sec. 12-2-3. - Amendments to Zoning Ordinance and districts, administrative procedures, and enforcement. 
(a)  Declaration of policy and review criteria. 
(1)  The city declares the enactment of these regulations governing the use and development of land, buildings, and structures as a measure necessary to ensure the orderly development of the community. Therefore, no change shall be made in these regulations or in the boundaries of the zoning districts except: 
a.  To correct any error in the regulations or map; 
b.  To recognize changed or changing conditions or circumstances in a particular locality; 
c.  To recognize changes in technology, the style of living, or manner of conducting business; or 
d.  To change the property to uses in accordance with the city's adopted comprehensive plan. 
(2)  In making a determination regarding a requested zoning change, the planning and zoning board and the city council shall consider the following factors: 
a.  Whether the uses permitted by the proposed change will be appropriate in the immediate area concerned, and their relationship to the general area and to the city as a whole; 
b.  Whether the proposed change is in accordance with any existing or proposed plans for providing public schools, streets, water supply, sanitary sewers, and other utilities to the area; 
c.  The amount of vacant land currently classified for similar development in the vicinity and elsewhere in the city, and any special circumstances that may make a substantial part of such vacant land unavailable for development; 
d.  The recent rate at which land is being developed in the same zoning classification as the request, particularly in the vicinity of the proposed change; 
e.  How other areas designated for similar development will be, or are likely to be, affected if the proposed amendment is approved; and 
f.  Any other factors that will substantially affect the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. 
(b)  Authority to amend ordinance. 
(1)  The city council may from time to time, after receiving a recommendation thereon by the planning and zoning board and after public hearings required by law, amend, supplement, or change the regulations herein provided or the boundaries of the zoning districts specified on the zoning map. Any amendment to the zoning ordinance text or to zoning district boundaries may be ordered for consideration by the city council, may be initiated by the planning and zoning board or the city manager, or may be requested by the owner of real property (or his/her authorized representative). 
(2)  No person who owes delinquent taxes, delinquent paving assessments, impact fees, or any other delinquent debts or obligations to the city, and which are directly attributable to a piece of property requested for zoning shall be allowed to submit a zoning request until the taxes, assessments, debts, or obligations directly attributable to said property and owed by the owner or previous owner thereof shall have been first fully discharged by payment, or until an arrangement satisfactory to the city has been made for the payment of such taxes, assessments, debts or obligations. It shall be the applicant's responsibility to provide evidence or proof that all amounts owed have been paid. 
(c)  Application. 
(1)  Each application for zoning (including a zoning change, zoning amendment, or text amendment to a provision(s) of this zoning ordinance), shall be made in writing on an application form available in the offices of planning and development. The application shall be delivered to the offices of planning and development at least 30 days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the planning and zoning board, as set forth by city council minute order. Supplemental documentation shall be provided as set forth in the application on file in the offices of planning and development. 
(2)  All zoning requests involving real property (including zoning change and zoning amendment requests) shall be accompanied by a notarized statement verifying land ownership and, if applicable, evidence of land owner's agent authority to file the request. 
(3)  Zoning applications which do not include all required information and materials (as outlined above and per other city development review policies) will be considered incomplete, shall not be accepted for official submission by the city, and shall not be scheduled on a planning and zoning board agenda until the proper information is provided to city staff. 
(d)  Notice of board hearing. 
(1)  For zoning requests involving real property (including zoning change and zoning amendment requests), the planning and zoning board shall hold at least one public hearing on each zoning application, as per applicable state law (Chapter 211, Texas Local Government Code). For proposed changes to zoning district boundaries (including rezoning requests), notice of the public hearing to occur before the planning and zoning board shall be accomplished by publishing the purpose, time and place of the public hearing in the official newspaper of the city before the fifteenth (15th) calendar day prior to the date of the public hearing. Written notice of each public hearing shall also be sent to each owner, as indicated by the most recently approved city tax roll, of real property within 200 feet thereof, said written notice to be sent before the tenth (10th) calendar day prior to the date such hearing is held. Such notice may be served by using the last known address as listed on the most recently approved tax roll and depositing the notice, postage paid, in the United States mail. 
(2)  For requests involving proposed changes to the text of the Zoning Ordinance, notice of the planning and zoning board hearing shall be accomplished by publishing the purpose, time and place of the public hearing in the official newspaper of the city before the fifteenth (15th) calendar day prior to the date of the public hearing. Changes in the ordinance text that do not change zoning district boundaries (i.e., which do not involve specific real property) do not require written notification to individual property owners. 
(3)  The city may, at its option, establish additional rules and procedures for public notification of proposed zoning changes and development proposals (e.g., site plans, plats, etc.) which may include, but not be limited to, the posting of a sign(s) on any property that is proposed for a zoning change or development by the applicant or its agent(s). Knowledge of and adherence to such rules and procedures, if so established by the city, shall be the responsibility of the applicant. 
(e)  Failure to appear. Failure of the applicant to appear before the planning and zoning board or the city council for more than one hearing without an approved delay by the city manager shall constitute sufficient grounds for the planning and zoning board or the city council to table or deny the application unless the city is notified in writing by the applicant at least 72 hours prior to the hearing. 
(f)  Planning and zoning board consideration and recommendation. 
(1)  The planning and zoning board shall function in accordance with this ordinance and with applicable provisions in the city's code of ordinances. 
(2)  The board shall hold a public hearing on a zoning request (including a zoning change, zoning amendment, and a proposed text amendment to the zoning ordinance) as per applicable state law (Chapter 211, Texas Local Government Code). 
(g)  City council consideration. 
(1)  Every zoning application which is recommended for approval (or approval with conditions) by the planning and zoning board shall be automatically forwarded (along with the board's favorable recommendation) to the city council for setting and holding of a second public hearing thereon following appropriate public hearing notification as prescribed below. 
An application that is recommended by the planning and zoning board for disapproval shall not be forwarded to the city council unless the applicant files a written appeal with the city manager within ten calendar days after the board's decision. 
(2)  After a public hearing is held before the city council regarding the zoning application, the city council shall take action as deemed appropriate. 
If the city council denies the request, then no other zoning application may be filed for all or part of the subject tract of land (or for that portion of the zoning ordinance, in the case of a text amendment request submitted by a property owner or citizen) for a waiting period of one year following the denial. In the instance that the request was initiated by the city and involved a proposed amendment to the text of the zoning ordinance, then there is no waiting period before the request can be reconsidered. 
The city council may, at its option, waive the one-year waiting period if, after due consideration of the matter at a scheduled and posted meeting, it is determined that denial of the request was based upon erroneous or omitted information, or if substantial new information pertaining to the request is discovered. 
(3)  Notice of the city council public hearing for a zoning request (including a zoning change, zoning amendment or a zoning ordinance text amendment) shall be given as per applicable state law (Chapter 211, Texas Local Government Code Chapter 211). 
(4)  For zoning requests involving real property (including zoning change and zoning amendment requests), a favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the city council shall be required to approve any change in zoning when written objections are received in accordance with the provisions of Section 211.006 of the Texas Local Government Code (commonly referred to as the "20 percent rule"). 
(5)  The city council may hold a joint public hearing on a zoning request (including a zoning change, zoning amendment or a zoning ordinance text amendment) along with the planning and zoning board, but the city council shall not take action on the request until it has received a final recommendation from the board. Notification for the city council's public hearing may be accomplished simultaneously with the public notification given for the public hearing to be held before the planning and zoning board. 
(h)  Schedule of fees, charges and expenses. 
(1)  Until all applicable fees, charges and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any zoning or development application or on any appeal. 
(2)  The city council, upon the recommendation of the planning and zoning board, shall determine and adopt a fee schedule for the purpose of recovering a portion of the administrative costs associated with processing zoning and development requests, including public hearings, that are called for in this ordinance. Such fees shall be paid by the applicant and shall not be designed to in any way restrict the applicant's ability to seek and receive a hearing or to generate revenue for other than recovery of actual administrative costs incurred by the city in the review and processing of applications. Immediately upon receipt of a complete submission for a zoning change or other development plan approval, the city shall issue a fee receipt and shall create a case file as a permanent city record thereof.

The city manager may, as he/she deems appropriate, require submission of additional information and materials (including actual samples of materials to be used) during the site plan review process. 
(2)  Design Standards for the CBD District. 
a.  False fronts or parapets may be added to existing buildings in order to add character and detail to simple facades. 
b.  Predominant exterior finish colors shall be of fired brick, similar to that which is present on adjacent existing buildings (other masonry materials may also be considered during site plan review).

Awnings shall not completely obstruct any windows on the building. 
2.  Projection. Since awnings must extend beyond the building face, a reasonable amount of projection shall be allowed. No awning shall extend more than five feet outward from the building face/surface. 
3.  Colors and materials. A mixture of colors is recommended, but no more than three different colors shall be used for awnings on a single building facade (excluding business logo, which may have more colors).

Sec. 12-3-15. - Overlay and special districts. 
    Overlay districts shall be used in conjunction with base zoning districts where it is appropriate to do so. In the use of the following overlay zoning classifications, the base district shall remain in effect unless changed by zoning amendment in accordance with this ordinance. New base districts or changes in existing base districts may be requested at the same time overlay or special districts are requested. Development within an overlay district must conform to the requirements of both districts or the more restrictive of the two. 
(a)  Conditional use provisions. 
(1)  Purpose and intent. 
a.  A conditional use is a land use which, because of its unique nature, is compatible with the permitted land uses in a given zoning district only upon a determination that the external effects of the use in relation to the existing and planned uses of adjoining property and the neighborhood can be mitigated through imposition of standards and conditions. This section sets forth the standards used to evaluate proposed conditional uses and the procedures for approving conditional use permit applications. 
b.  No conditional use shall be established and no building permit shall be issued for any use designated as a conditional use within a zoning district until a conditional use permit is issued in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. 
c.  If a use is not listed as either a permitted use or conditional use in the district for which the subject property is located, a conditional use permit shall be required. 
(2)  Status of conditional uses. The following general rules apply to all conditional uses: 
a.  The designation of a use in a zoning district as a conditional use does not constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be approved. 
b.  Approval of a conditional use permit shall authorize only the particular use for which the conditional use permit is issued. 
c.  No use authorized by a conditional use permit shall be enlarged, extended or relocated, nor may the number of dwelling units be increased, unless an application is made for approval of a new conditional use permit in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subsection. 
d.  Development of the use shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all the permits and approvals required by these zoning regulations, the City Code of Ordinances, and any permits required by regional, state and federal agencies. 
(3)  Procedures for conditional use approval. 
a.  Conditional use shall only be approved by the adoption of an ordinance following the same notice and hearing procedures as for zoning changes. 
b.  Upon receipt of a recommendation from the city manager, the planning and zoning board shall conduct a public hearing in order to formulate its recommendations to the city council on the conditional use permit application. Following the public hearing, the planning and zoning board shall recommend approval, approval subject to modification, or denial of the proposal to the city council in accordance with this ordinance. If the appropriateness of the use cannot be assured at the location, the planning and zoning board shall recommend denial of the application as being incompatible with existing uses or with other uses permitted by right in the district. 
c.  The city council shall be the final decision-maker on applications for conditional use permits. Following a public hearing and consideration of the planning and zoning board's recommendation, the city council shall approve, modify or deny the proposal for a conditional use permit in accordance with this ordinance. If the appropriateness of the use cannot be assured at the location, the application for conditional use permit shall be denied as being incompatible with existing uses or with other uses permitted by right in the district. 
(4)  Standards. 
a.  When considering applications for a conditional use permit, the planning and zoning board and the city council shall, on the basis of the site plan and other information submitted, evaluate the impact of the conditional use on, and the compatibility of the use with, surrounding properties and neighborhoods to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location. The planning and zoning board and the city council shall specifically consider the extent to which: 
1.  The proposed use at the specified location is consistent with the policies embodied in the adopted comprehensive plan; 
2.  The proposed use is consistent with the general purpose and intent of the applicable zoning district regulations; 
3.  The proposed use meets all supplemental standards specifically applicable to the use as set forth in this ordinance; 
4.  The proposed use is compatible with and preserves the character and integrity of adjacent development and neighborhoods and, as required by the particular circumstances, includes improvements or modifications either on-site or within the public rights-of-way to mitigate development-related adverse impacts, including but not limited to: 
i.  Adequate ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon with particular reference to vehicular and pedes-trian safety and convenience, and access in case of fire; 
ii.  Off-street parking and loading areas; 
iii.  Refuse and service areas; 
iv.  Utilities with reference to location, availability, and compatibility; 
v.  Screening and buffering, features to minimize visual impacts, and/or set-backs from adjacent uses; 
vi.  Control of signs, if any, and proposed exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, economic effect, and compatibility and harmony with properties in the district; 
vii.  Required yards and open space; 
viii.  Height and bulk of structures; 
ix.  Hours of operation; 
x.  Exterior construction material and building design; and 
xi.  Roadway adjustments, traffic control devices or mechanisms, and access restrictions to control traffic flow or divert traffic as may be needed to reduce or eliminate development-generated traffic on neighborhood streets. 
5.  The proposed use is not materially detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience and welfare, and does not result in material damage or prejudice to other property in the vicinity. 
b.  In approving the application, the planning and zoning board may recommend and the city council shall impose such conditions as are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with these standards and the purpose and intent of this subsection, in accordance with the procedures in this ordinance. Any conditions imposed shall be set forth in the ordinance approving the conditional use. The city shall maintain a record of such approved conditional uses and conditions attached thereto. 
c.  The foregoing standards of development shall not be subject to variances that otherwise could be granted by the board of adjustment, nor may conditions imposed by the city council subsequently be waived or varied by the board. In conformity with the authority of the city council to authorize conditional uses, the city council may waive or modify specific standards otherwise made applicable to the use by this ordinance, to secure the general objectives of this subsection; provided, however, that the city council shall not waive or modify any approval factor set forth in this subsection. 
(5)  Amendment. No proposed or existing building, premise or land use authorized as a conditional use may be established, enlarged, modified, structurally altered, or otherwise changed from that approved in the conditional use permit, unless such amendment is authorized in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in this subsection, and the conditional use permit are amended accordingly. 
(b)  Historic overlay district. 
(1)  General purpose and description.

The HD zoning classification, through separate ordinance, will provide design criteria for the redevelopment, revitalization and preservation of specific sites, neighborhoods and commercial areas. 
c.  A historic overlay district is a district that recognizes the city's desire to promote and protect the health, safety, economic, cultural, educational, and general welfare of the public through the protection, enhancement, and perpetuation of one or more districts of historical, archeological and cultural importance and significance. 
d.  The city council may designate sites, buildings, structures, landscapes and objects as historic overlay districts along with the public rights-of-way in and surrounding them and define, amend and delineate the boundaries thereof, by adopting zoning overlay districts.

f.  Separate ordinances are required to designate each historic overlay district. Ordinances designating each district shall identify the designated boundaries, applicable designation criteria, and design standards for that district. 
g.  Nothing contained in this section or in the designation of property as being in a historic overlay district shall affect the present legal use of property. Use classifications as to all property which may be included in a historic overlay district shall continue to be governed by the general zoning ordinance and the procedures therein established. In no case, however, shall any use be permitted which requires the demolition, razing, remodeling, or alteration of any buildings or structures in such a historic overlay district so as to adversely affect the character of the historic overlay district, except upon compliance with the terms of this section. 
h.  If there is a conflict between the regulations in a historic overlay district ordinance and the regulations of the underlying zoning district, the regulations contained in the historic overlay district ordinance control. If there is a conflict between the regulations contained in a historic overlay district ordinance and these regulations, the regulations contained in the historic overlay district ordinance control. 
i.  It is not the intent of the historic preservation commission, planning and zoning commission or city council to place individual property owners involuntarily in a historic overlay district or be subject to design guidelines except in circumstances when the future of a high priority single property site, as designated by the adopted historic resources survey, becomes threatened, the city council may initiate historic district designation without consent of the owners of the property in accordance with subsection (4)c. below. 
(2)  Definitions. Terms shall be as defined in the City of Weatherford Code of Ordinances, in section 12-1-5 of title XII or in appendix 1, Definitions, chapter 13, Historic Preservation, of title IV, Building and Property Maintenance Regulations and Historic Preservation and unless specifically noted otherwise, are standard throughout this section:

(c)  Planned Development (PD) district. 
(1)  General purpose and description. The purpose of the planned development regulations is to encourage flexibility in the use and development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to provide a high level of urban amenities; to preserve the quality of the natural environment; and to provide flexibility in the development of land subject to development standards coordinated with the provisions of necessary public services and facilities. 
(2)  Pre-application review. Prior to making an application to the planning and zoning board, the application shall be reviewed by the development review committee (DRC). There is no fee for this review. DRC review is for the purpose of providing information to the applicant prior to their entering into binding contractual commitments or incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys or other data. 
(3)  Application of Planned Development district provisions. An application for a planned development district is considered the same as a zoning change, and is therefore made to the planning and zoning board and city council in the same manner that an application for zoning change is made according to this ordinance. 
a.  The application for PD zoning shall be accompanied by a development site plan, the appropriate filing fee, along with a list of supplemental development regulations, which will become a part of the amending ordinance and be referenced on the zoning map. Changes in the development site plan or supplemental development regulations shall be considered the same as changes in the zoning map. The proposed application and site plan shall be processed as required except that minor changes, which do not cause any of the following circumstances to occur, may be authorized by the city manager (or his/her designee): 
1.  A five percent or greater increase in the gross floor areas of structures: 
2.  Any substantial and material changes in external effects on adjacent property, such as noise, heat, light, glare and vibration; 
3.  A ten percent or greater increase in the height of structures; 
4.  A ten percent or greater reduction in the originally approved setbacks from property lines; 
5.  A five percent or greater reduction in the ratio of off-street parking and loading space; and/or 
6.  A change in the size, height, lighting, flashing, animation or orientation of originally approved signs, which were approved as part of the PD approval as a sign plan. 
b.  The city manager shall prepare a written report analyzing the development site plan, and such report shall be given to the planning and zoning board and the applicant prior to the public hearing. Upon recommendation for approval by the planning and zoning board to the city council, the request will be presented to the city council for a first reading and a final reading. 
c.  Effect of Planned Development District approval: Approval of a Planned Development District shall constitute an amendment to the zoning ordinance. Designation of a property as a Planned Development District, in accordance with an approved development plan, shall supersede all existing and prior zoning classifications. Such property shall for zoning purposes be identified by the letters "PD" followed by an identifying number, assigned by the city manager. 
(4)  Standards. All Planned Development Districts shall, at a minimum, satisfy the following standards and requirements: 
a.  Uses permitted. The development plan shall specify, both for the project as a whole and/or for subareas within the project, as appropriate, those principal and accessory uses as are to be permitted, identified as permitted uses, conditional uses, and prohibited uses. The city council may include or exclude uses from the development plan or include uses with attached conditions as appropriate to achieve the intent of these provisions. 
In making its determinations of the uses to be permitted within the PD District, the city council may consider the compatibility and relationship of uses within the project, the compatibility and relationship of permitted uses adjoining or in proximity to the PD District, the appropriateness of permitted uses for the area in general and their overall impact on the community, and the consistency of the permitted uses with other adopted plans and policies. 
b.  Intensity of development. The development plan shall contain provisions to regulate the intensity of development within the Planned Development District. Such provisions may apply to the project as a whole or to subareas within the project, as appropriate. 
1.  For non-residential development, the intensity of development may be regulated: 
i.  By specifying an appropriate floor area ratio(s) (FAR); 
ii.  By specifying maximum square footage or gross leasable area; 
iii.  By specifying setbacks, height and bulk restrictions; or 
iv.  By a combination of such restrictions for the project as a whole or for components or subareas within the project. 
2.  For residential development, the density of residential dwelling units within a PD District shall be computed in accordance with a formula identified as part of the development plan. Such density formula shall be accompanied by supporting documentation and logic behind the density formula. 
The permitted number of dwelling units may be distributed in any manner over the residential portion of the project consistent with the intent and provisions of this ordinance. The development plan shall specify distribution of residential density for the project as a whole or for subareas within the project as appropriate. In making its determination regarding the distribution of residential densities, the city council may consider compatibility of residential densities with other uses within the district as well as outside the district, the impact of residential densities on public facilities and services, and the consistency with the master plan, the comprehensive plan, and/or other adopted plans and policies. 
c.  Bulk, area and height requirements. The development plan shall specify bulk, area and height restrictions for the project as a whole and for subareas and/or components of the project as appropriate. The city council may impose alternate or additional standards or restrictions to achieve the intent of this ordinance. In making its determination regarding such standards or restrictions, the city council may consider the character and scale of the proposed development as it relates to other uses and structures both within the district and outside the district, the general character and scale of similar developments within the area of the proposal, and the consistency with adopted plans and policies. 
d.  Public facilities. The development plan shall specify conditions, restrictions and standards relating to the timely provisions of necessary public facilities as appropriate. The city council may impose conditions, restrictions and standards as appropriate to achieve the intent of this title. In making its determination regarding such conditions, restrictions and standards, the city council may consider the adequacy of existing facilities, the timely provision of adequate facilities and the overall cost to the community. 
e.  Access to public thoroughfares. The development plan shall specify the location and general design of ingress and egress to the project along with access restrictions as appropriate. The city council may impose such access standards and restrictions as necessary to protect the integrity and function of the city's thoroughfare system and to otherwise achieve the intent of this title. In making its determination regarding such access standards and restriction, the council may consider the classification and function of the thoroughfare system, existing and projected traffic volumes, the condition and design of the affected thoroughfares, the effect of the proposed development on traffic flow and circulation patterns on other adopted plans and policies. 
f.  Off-street parking and loading requirements. Unless specifically modified by the development plan, the off-street parking and loading requirements contained within the zoning regulations shall apply. Reductions in off-street parking and loading standards shall be approved only if it can be demonstrated that parking demand will be less due to density and/or occupancy characteristics of the project and/or the availability of public transportation. 
g.  Signs. Unless specifically modified by the development plan, the sign regulations contained within the zoning regulations shall apply. Modifications to the sign regulations shall be approved only if the general intent to the sign regulations regarding size, location, illumination, structural integrity and relation to surrounding uses is satisfied. 
h.  Perimeter treatment. The development plan shall specify any special treatment of perimeter areas designed to mitigate the impact of the project upon adjoining properties and/or to achieve an appropriate transition between land uses and densities. The council may impose those standards and requirements for perimeter treatment it deems necessary to protect adjoining properties from adverse effects and to achieve an appropriate transition of land uses and densities. 
(5)  Application process. 
a.  Procedure. Applications for Planned Development (PD) District designation shall be processed pursuant to a three-step review process as specified in this subsection. The three-step procedure shall include: 1) a pre-application conference with DRC (development review committee); 2) a preliminary development plan (planning and zoning board); and 3) a final development plan (city council).

(a)  Conformance with the use charts: 
(1)  The use of land and/or buildings shall be in accordance with those listed in the following use charts. No land or building shall hereafter be used and no building or structure shall be erected, altered, or converted other than for those uses specified in the zoning district in which it is located. The legend for interpreting the permitted uses in the use charts (section 12-4-2) is: 
      Designates use permitted in the zoning district indicated. 
      (Blank) Designates use prohibited (i.e., not allowed) in the zoning district indicated. 
      Designates use may be permitted in the zoning district indicated by a CUP (also see section 12-3-12). 
      The land use is defined within section 12-1-5 of this ordinance. 
(2)  If a use is not listed (or is blank) in the use charts, it is not allowed in any zoning district 
(3)  Unless otherwise noted, a use listed in the charts below will be the predominant use of the land. If noted as an accessory use, then such use will only be allowed as an accessory use (as defined in this ordinance) to a permitted use. 
(4)  Use chart organization: The land uses are listed in the use charts (section 12-4-2) in alphabetical order within specific categories of use. 
(5)  Classification of new/unlisted uses: It is recognized that new types of land use will arise in the future, and forms of land use not presently anticipated may seek to locate in the City of Weatherford. In order to provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use in the use charts (section 12-4-2) shall be made as follows: 
a.  Initiation: 
1.  A person, city department, the planning and zoning commission, or the city council may propose zoning amendments to regulate new and previously unlisted uses. 
2.  A person requesting the addition of a new or unlisted use shall submit to the city manager or his/her designee, all information necessary for the classification of the use, including but not limited to the following: 
i.  The nature of the use and whether the use involves dwelling activity, sales, services, or processing; 
ii.  The type of product sold or produced under the use; 
iii.  Whether the use has enclosed or outside storage and the amount and nature of the storage; 
iv.  Anticipated employment typically anticipated with the use; 
v.  Transportation requirements; 
vi.  The nature and time of occupancy and operation of the premises; 
vii.  The off-street parking and loading requirements; 
viii.  The amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic materials and vibration likely to be generated; 
ix.  The requirements for public utilities such as sanitary sewer and water and any special public services that may be required; and 
x.  Impervious surface coverage. 
b.  The city manager, or his/her designee, shall refer the question concerning any new or unlisted use to the planning and zoning commission requesting a recommendation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. The referral of the use interpretation question shall be accompanied by the statement of facts in Subsection "b" above. An amendment to this ordinance shall be required as prescribed by section 12-2-3. 
c.  The planning and zoning commission shall consider the nature and described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses permitted in the various districts and determine the zoning district or districts within which such use is most similar and should be permitted (by right or by CUP). 
d.  The planning and zoning commission shall transmit its findings and recommendations to the city council as to the classification proposed for any new or unlisted use. The city council shall approve or disapprove the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission or make such determination concerning the classification of such use as is determined appropriate based upon its findings. If approved, the new or unlisted use shall be amended in the use charts of the zoning ordinance according to section 12-2-3. 
e.  Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted by the city manager, or his/her designee, as those of a similar use. When a determination of the appropriate zoning district cannot be readily ascertained, the same criteria outlined in subsection (a)(2) above shall be followed for determination of the appropriate district. The decision of the city manager, or his/her designee, may be appealed according to the process outlined in subsections b. through d. above. 
f.  Questions and/or appeals of an official as to the interpretation of an existing listed use and its application shall be made in accordance with Title II, Chapter 5, Zoning Board of Adjustment and Title XII, Zoning Ordinance of the Weatherford Code of Ordinances.

5.  All portable storage containers must include a "placard" not less than one square foot which is clearly visible from the right-of-way which includes the container identification number, date of its placement on the property, date that removal will be required, permit number, and local telephone number. 
6.  Portable storage containers shall only be located on an improved surface. 
7.  Portable storage containers shall not be placed in required landscaped areas, open areas, retention basins, drive aisles, fire lanes, loading zones, required parking spaces, or other locations that may cause hazardous conditions, constitute a threat to public safety, or create a condition detrimental to surrounding land uses and development. 
8.  Portable storage containers shall be a minimum ten feet from any property line. 
9.  Portable storage containers shall be allowed for no more than a total of 15 days in any consecutive six-month period, unless the property owner has a valid remodel permit or seasonal portable container permit, at which time the unit may remain on the property for the duration of the permit.

(g)  Lighting and glare standards. Standards for controlling lighting and glare are set forth to reduce the annoyance and inconvenience to property owners and traffic hazards to motorists. These standards are intended to allow reasonable enjoyment of adjacent and nearby property by their owners and occupants while requiring adequate levels of lighting of parking areas. 
(1)  Nonresidential site lighting and glare standards. 
a.  Any use shall be operated so as not to produce obnoxious and intense glare or direct illumination across the bounding property line from a visible source of illumination of such intensity as to create a nuisance or detract from the use or enjoyment of adjacent property. All outside lights shall be made up of a light source and reflector so selected that acting together, the light beam is controlled and not directed across any bounding property line above a height of three feet. The allowable maximum intensity measured at the property line of a residential use in a residential district shall be 0.25 foot candles. Light poles shall be placed on the site a setback equal to its height from all adjacent residential property.

Sec. 12-5-7. - Sign regulations. 
(a)  Statement of purpose. The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of messages. Left completely unregulated, however, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. This section is intended to provide such regulation as will minimize the harmful effects of signs upon the health, safety and welfare of the general public and economic values in the community as well as the attractive appearance and natural beauty of the community. This section is intended to constitute a comprehensive system of reasonable, effective, consistent, content neutral and nondiscriminatory sign standards and requirements. These regulations are intended to apply to all new signs and to provide for the elimination of all existing signs made nonconforming by this ordinance, as soon as it is fair and reasonably feasible. The purposes of these regulations also include the following: 
(1)  To promote the safety of persons and property by providing that signs do not create a hazard due to collapse, fire, collision, decay or abandonment, do not obstruct fire fighting or police surveillance, and do not create traffic hazards by confusing or distracting motorists, or by impairing the driver's ability to see pedestrians, other vehicles, or traffic signs. 
(2)  To stabilize and reinforce property values to protect private and public investment. 
(3)  To promote open space and improve the attractiveness and scenic beauty of the community which is considered to be important to the tourist industry and provides an economic base for the city and to encourage a concern for the visual environment which makes the city a more desirable place to live, work, and visit. 
(4)  To control the quality of materials, construction, electrification and maintenance of all signs. 
(5)  To lessen hazardous situations, confusion and visual clutter caused by proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation and excessive height, area and bulk of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(6)  To balance the right to convey messages through signs and to protect the public's right against the unrestricted proliferation of signs. 
(7)  To insure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
(8)  To promote the stated purposes of the International Building Code, as adopted and modified by the city, which are expressly incorporated herein. 
(9)  Except to the extent permitted by applicable federal and state law, nothing herein is intended to in any way preempt any federal or state law requirements regarding signs or to exempt any person or entity from compliance therewith. 
(b)  Applicability. The standards and procedures of this section shall apply to all land within the city and to all land within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. Regulations applicable to signs in residentially zoned districts shall be applicable to properties of agricultural and residential use in the extraterritorial jurisdiction. Regulations applicable to nonresidential zoning districts shall be applicable to properties of nonresidential use located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction. The provisions of this section shall apply to permitees, owners, agents and persons having the beneficial use of a sign and shall also apply to the owner(s) of the land or structures upon which a sign is located and to the person(s) erecting a sign. 
(c)  Administration. The provisions of this section shall be administered and enforced by the director of planning and development (or his/her designee). 
(d)  Definitions. For purposes of this section of the Zoning Ordinance the following words, terms and phrases shall have the meanings indicated. Definitions of other terms used within this section may be found elsewhere in the zoning ordinance.

a.  Computation of frontage. If a premise contains walls facing more than one property line or encompasses property frontage bounded by more than one street or other property usages, the sign area(s) for each building wall or property frontage will be computed separately for each building wall or property line facing a different frontage.

Exception. When a premise located in a commercial zoning district has frontage on more than one street or highway and there is no residentially zoned property within 1,000 feet of the proposed locations of the signs, the required distance between signs may be reduced to a distance equal to one-half the combined street frontage of the two streets where the signs are proposed to be located provided that all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The combined square footage of the two proposed signs shall not exceed the total square footage permitted by this section for one such sign;

(6)  Maintenance. Every sign permitted by this ordinance shall be kept in good condition and repair. When any sign becomes insecure, in danger of falling or is otherwise deemed unsafe by the director of planning and development, or if any sign shall be unlawfully installed, erected or maintained in violation of any of the provisions of this ordinance, the owner thereof or the person or firm using same shall, upon written notice by the director of planning and development forthwith in the case of immediate danger, and in any case within not more than ten days, make such sign conform to the provisions of this ordinance, or shall remove it.

(8)  Nonconforming signs. It is the intent of this subsection to recognize that the eventual elimination, as expeditiously as reasonable, of nonconforming signs, is as much a legitimate concern to the health, safety and welfare of the public as is the prohibition of new signs which would violate the provisions of this section. It is further the intent of this subsection to acknowledge the interests of the owner and requirements of applicable state law to the issue of nonconforming signs. 
A nonconforming sign, in existence and lawful as of the effective date of this section, shall be permitted to remain in its same location subject to the conditions herein.

(4)  The city council finds that the cities represented in the relevant studies, reports and findings reviewed by the city have similar community characteristics to those of the city in relevant respects. 
(5)  The city council finds, based on the above studies, reports and findings, as well as the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, that sexually oriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values, and municipal regulation aimed at reducing adverse secondary effects is the most effective and appropriate mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(6)  The city council finds, based in part upon the results of the Survey of Fort Worth and Dallas Appraisers, September 2004, that sexually oriented businesses that engage in only retail sales or rental of sexually oriented adult merchandise for off premise use have adverse effects on surrounding property values and the ability of surrounding properties to sell or develop, similar to the adverse effects generated by sexually oriented businesses which offer on-site adult entertainment. 
(7)  The city council finds, based in part upon the reports/affidavit of Dr. Richard McCleary to the City of Kennedale and the City of Sioux City, that sexually oriented businesses that engage in only retail sales or rental of sexually oriented adult merchandise for off premise use cause public safety or crime-related adverse effects on the surrounding community, similar to the adverse effects generated by sexually oriented businesses which offer on-site adult entertainment. 
(8)  The city council finds, based on the above studies, reports and findings presented to the city council that it is reasonably likely that these adverse secondary effects will occur in the city. 
(9)  The city council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve and protect property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight. 
(10)  The city has a legitimate and substantial governmental interest in limiting the detrimental secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses as a means of promoting the public health, safety and welfare. 
(11)  The city council finds that a reasonable number of locations are available within the city limits of the city and within surrounding areas for the operation of sexually oriented businesses including sexually oriented businesses that engage in only retail sales or rental of sexually oriented adult merchandise for off premise use. 
(12)  The city council finds that these amendments have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials, nor do these amendments have the effect of restricting or denying access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O2019-08 , adopted March 26, 2019, amended Title XIII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Title XIII,  13-1-1-13-5-5, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 374-2008-49, adopted Sep. 9, 2008. 

CHAPTER 1. - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE; FLOOD LOSS REDUCTION METHODS 

Sec. 13-1-1. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. O2019-08 , 3-26-19) 
Sec. 13-1-2. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. O2019-08 , 3-26-19) 
CHAPTER 2. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 13-2-1. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AC, AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map with a one percent change or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM. Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AC, AI-CC, VO, VI-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation means the computed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during the base flood. Base flood elevations (BFEs) are shown on flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and on the flood profiles. The BFE is the regulatory requirement for the elevation or floodproofing of structures. The relationship between the BFE and a structure's elevation determines the flood insurance premium. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to. buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means a non-basement building (i) built, in the case of a building in Zones AI-30, AE, A, A99, AC, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, yE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones AI-30, AE, A, A99, AC, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones VI-30, yE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Existing construction means, for the purpose of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary- floodway map. 
    Floodplain or flood prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Flood proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the Natural Register;

a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or; 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)). Includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (3),(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 9.5-32(b)[sic] of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (section 13-1-3). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon, 
a.  showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and 
c.  a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
    Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  the criteria outlined in subsections 1-9 above are met, and 
(2)  the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. No. O2019-08 , 3-26-19) 
CHAPTER 5. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 13-5-1. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements. 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and, 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. O2019-08 , 3-26-19) 
Sec. 13-5-2. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) section 13-2-2. (ii) subsection 13-4-2(8), or (iii) subsection 13-5-3(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in subsection 13-4-3(a)(1) [sic], is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that from below to two feet above the base flood level, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided on at least two separate walls. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes: 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed with Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A and AE on the community's FIRM on sites 
1.  outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2.  in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3.  in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is two feet above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  meet the permit requirements of subsection 13-4-3, and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. 
    A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. O2019-08 , 3-26-19) 
Sec. 13-5-3. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections 13-1-2, 13-13, and 13-1-4 of this chapter. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of section 13-3-3, section 13-4-4; and the provisions of article V [sic] of this chapter. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 13-3-2 or subsection 13-4-2(8) of this chapter. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. O2019-08 , 3-26-19) 
Sec. 13-5-4. - Floodways. 
    Floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 13-3-2, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article V [sic]. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

The written notice of appeal must plainly state the grounds of the appeal of the determination and have attached a true and correct copy of the written notice issued by the animal control authority which is appealed. A written notice of determination as a dangerous animal issued by the animal control authority and not timely appealed as provided in this subsection shall be considered, in all respects, final upon the eleventh day following its issuance.
The municipal court shall, upon receipt of a written appeal as provided above, set the matter for hearing. The hearing must be set not later than ten days from the date of the filing of the written appeal. The court shall provide written notice of the date and time of the disposition hearing to:

(1)The owner of the animal;(2)The animal control authority; and(3)The city attorney's office.
The written determination of the animal control authority that the animal is a dangerous animal shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the animal is a dangerous animal. Any interested person may present competent evidence to the court to rebut the presumption of the animal's status. The municipal court shall render its decision in writing within ten days of the date of the hearing. Copies of the decision shall be forwarded to the owner and to the city attorney's office. In the event the decision of the municipal court affirms the animal control's authority that the animal is a dangerous animal, the owner shall be required to comply with the registration requirements set forth below and the animal shall remain impounded pending the owner's compliance with those registration requirements.

A registration certificate issued pursuant to this section may not be transferred, sold or otherwise conveyed to another person.(c)The registration required by this subsection shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of its issuance and the owner shall be required to reregister the dangerous animal at the expiration of its registration period. Reregistration of a dangerous animal shall require compliance with each of the above provisions.

In the event the owner fails to properly reregister a dangerous animal impounded pursuant to this provision within 15 days of its impoundment, the animal control authority shall be authorized to humanely euthanize the animal.(d)An animal finally determined, by notice of the animal control authority or by the municipal court, to be a dangerous animal shall not be released from impoundment until each of the requirements of subsection (a)(1)(5) has been met by the owner and all fees and costs incurred in connection with the care, impoundment and other required procedures for the animal have been paid to the city. A finding by the animal control authority that an owner of a dangerous animal is no longer in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall constitute grounds for revocation of the animal's registration and seizure and impoundment of the animal as provided in subsection (b). In the event the owner of an animal finally determined to be a dangerous animal fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) (1)(5) within 30 days of the final written determination, the animal control authority shall be authorized to humanely euthanize the animal.

The owner of any dog or cat which has been reported to have inflicted a bite or scratch on any person shall, upon request by the animal control authority, immediately surrender the animal for quarantine under the auspices of the animal control authority.
