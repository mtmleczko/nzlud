PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Haltom City, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1973 Code, as supplemented through October 9, 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1973 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Linda Davis, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Helen Harris, City Secretary, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Haltom City Charter, as adopted on December 3, 1955. Subsequently, an Ordinance adopted Nov. 17, 2008, amended the Charter in its entirety to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, the Charter pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by a parenthetical history note following the amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

PREAMBLE 
    We, the citizens of Haltom City, Texas, in order to establish a home rule municipal government, provide for the future progress of our city and obtain more fully the benefits of local self-government, do hereby adopt this home rule charter in accordance with the statutes of the State of Texas; and do hereby declare the residents of the City of Haltom City in Tarrant County, Texas, living within the legally established boundaries of said city, to be a political subdivision of the State of Texas, incorporated forever under the name and style of the "City of Haltom City" with such powers, rights and duties as are herein provided. The municipal government provided by this charter shall be known as the "Council-Manager Government" pursuant to its provisions and, subject only to the limitations imposed by the State Constitution and statutes, all powers of the city shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this charter, or if the manner be not prescribed then in such manner as may be prescribed by ordinance.

Except as required by state law for failure to provide municipal services, the council shall never, regardless of the facts and circumstances, be required to discontinue any territory as a part of the city except at its exclusive discretion expressed by ordinance.

Sec. 11.24. - Alternate promotional system. 
(a)  On the recommendation of the Department Head of the police or fire department and a majority vote of the Sworn Employees in the affected department, the Commission may adopt an alternate promotional system to select persons to occupy non-entry level positions other than positions that are filled by appointment by the Department Head. 
(b)  Upon the receipt of a recommendation by the Department Head for a revised promotional system, the Commission may order the Director to conduct an election and to submit the revised promotional system either to all Sworn Employees within the rank immediately below the classification for which the promotional examination is to be administered or to all Sworn Employees in the affected department. 
(c)  The Director shall hold the election on or after the 30th day after the date [of] notice of the election is posted at the affected department. The election shall be conducted throughout each regular work shift at an accessible location within the department during a 24-hour period. (In the Fire Department, such election shall be conducted throughout each regular work shift at an accessible location within the department during three consecutive 24-hour periods.) 
(d)  The ballot shall contain the specific amendment to the promotional procedure. Each Sworn Employee in the affected department shall be given the opportunity to vote by secret ballot "for" or "against" the amendment. 
(e)  The revised promotional system must be approved by a majority vote of the affected Sworn Employees voting. A defeated promotional system amendment may not be placed on a ballot for a vote by the affected Sworn Employees for at least 12 months after the date the prior election was held, but this provision does not apply if the head of the department recommends a different proposal to the Commission. 
(f)  The Commission shall canvass the votes within 30 days after the date the election is held. An appeal alleging election irregularity must be filed with the Commission within five business days after the date the election closes. If approved by the affected Sworn Employees, the promotional system amendment becomes effective after all election disputes have been ruled on and the Commission has canvassed the election votes. 
(g)  At any time after an alternate promotional system has been adopted under this section and has been in effect for at least 180 days, the Department Head may petition the Commission to terminate the alternate system, and the Commission shall determine whether or not to terminate the alternate system. 
(h)  At any time after an alternate promotional system has been adopted under this section and has been in effect for at least 180 days, a petition signed by at least 35 percent of the affected Sworn Employees may be submitted to the Commission asking that the alternate promotional system be reconsidered. If a petition is submitted, the Commission shall, within 60 days after the date the petition is filed, hold an election as prescribed by this section. If a majority of those voting vote to terminate, the Commission shall determine whether or not to terminate the alternate promotional system. 
(i)  If the alternate system is terminated, an additional eligibility list may not be created under the alternate system. 
(j)  An eligibility list may not be created if an election under this section is pending. An existing eligibility list, whether created under the system prescribed by this article or created under an alternate system adopted under this section, may not be terminated before or extended beyond its expiration date.

Sec. 11.25. - Promotional eligibility lists/appointments. 
(a)  If an eligibility list for the promotional position to be filled exists on the date the vacancy occurs, or a new position is created, the Director, upon request of the Department Head, shall provide the eligibility list to the Department Head. 
(b)  If an eligibility list does not exist on the date a vacancy occurs or a new position is created, an examination will be held to create a new eligibility list within 90 days after the date the vacancy occurs or a new position is created. Once the eligibility list is created, the Director shall provide the eligibility list to the Department Head. The Department Head shall fill the position by appointment from the eligibility list furnished by the Director within 30 days after the date the list is created unless promotional examination test question appeals have not been resolved in which case the Department Head shall wait until all promotional examination test question appeals have been resolved by the Commission. 
(c)  If an eligibility list exists on the date a vacancy occurs or a new position is created, the Department Head shall fill the position by appointment from the eligibility list furnished by the Director within 30 days after the date the vacancy occurs. The eligibility list will remain valid until such appointment. 
(d)  Unless the Department Head has a good and sufficient reason for not appointing the candidate having the highest grade on the eligibility list, the Department Head shall appoint the eligible promotional candidate having the highest grade on the eligibility list. If the Department Head has a good and sufficient reason for not appointing the eligible promotional candidate having the highest grade, the Department Head shall personally discuss the reason with the candidate being bypassed before appointing another candidate. The Department Head shall within five business days file the reason in writing with the Commission and shall provide the bypassed candidate with a copy of the written notice. On application of the bypassed candidate, the reason the Department Head did not appoint the bypassed candidate is subject to review by the Commission. 
(e)  If a candidate is bypassed, the candidate's name is returned to its place on the eligibility list and shall be reconsidered by the Department Head if a vacancy occurs. If the Department Head refuses three times to appoint a candidate, files the reasons for the refusals in writing with the Commission, and the Commission does not set aside the refusals, the candidate's name shall be removed from the eligibility list. If the candidate(s) is bypassed and therefore results in there being no other candidates on the list then the list is invalid and a new test shall be administered. 
(f)  The Commission shall keep each eligibility list for a promotional examination in effect for a period of 12-months after the date on which the promotion process is completed, unless the list has been exhausted as provided in this article. An examination will not be administered until a vacancy occurs or is reasonably anticipated.

a.  Special conditions exist, e.g., the piece of property involved is unique and is not configured the same as every other lot or tract in the area or the property contains properties or attributes not common to other similarly situated properties. For example, the uniqueness of the shape or design makes it impossible to comply with the provisions of this section.

Financial hardship can be one of a number of reasons for which a variance is granted. 
d.  The applicant must show that the literal enforcement of the terms of this section will work a hardship on his property denying him reasonable use of the property.

c.  Notice shall be sent by United States mail, return receipt requested, not less than ten days before the public hearing, to all property owners (as the ownership appears in the most current tax rolls for the city) whose property is located within 200 feet of any portion of the boundary of the property for which a variance or waiver has been requested. 
d.  The terms and conditions of the variance or waiver, if granted, shall be noted on the permit. 
(3)  If a variance or waiver application is denied by the City Council, no other variance or waiver of like kind relating to the same building or proposed building shall be considered or acted upon by the City Council for a period of six months subsequent to the denial.

(b)  The determination of the filter area shall be made on a basis of a true and effective supported septum surface. In the case of fabric septums, the area computation will be made on the basis of measurements of the septum support in a reasonable constant plane. Area allowance shall not be granted for folds in the septum fabric or deviations in the septum surface which would easily bridge. 
(c)  The tank containing the filter elements shall be constructed of steel, plastic or other suitable material, which will satisfactorily provide resistance to corrosion, with or without coating. Pressure filters shall be designed for a working pressure equal to the shutoff head of the pump, with a factor safety of four. Vacuum filters shall be designed to withstand the pressure developed by the weight of the water contained therein and closed vacuum filters shall, in addition, be designed to withstand the crushing pressure developed under a vacuum of 25 inches of mercury, both with a factor safety of 3.5. In either type filter where the tank is fabricated from material which is corroded by water, then a suitable corrosion resistant coating shall be applied to retard such attack. 
(d)  The filter elements shall be fabricated of corrosion resistant materials throughout. They shall be designed to be adequately resistant to a differential pressure between influent and effluent of not less than the maximum pressure, which can be developed by the circulating pump and shall be of adequate strength to resist any additional stresses developed during the cleaning operation. The filter septum, on which the filter-aid cake is deposited, shall be provided with openings, the minimum dimensions of which shall be not greater than 0.005 inch. 
(e)  Provision shall be made to introduce filter aid into the filter in such a way as to evenly precoat the filter septum before the filter is placed in operation. The amount of filter aid shall be selected to provide at least the same protection to the filter septum as would be provided by the use of 0.1 pound of diatomite filter aid per square foot of filter area. Use of additional equipment to provide body feed to the filter influent is optional. Where provided, such equipment shall have the capacity to continuously and uniformly feed at a rate of not less than 0.1 pound of filter aid per square foot of filter area per 24 hours. 
(f)  The filter piping shall be so designed that during the precoating operation the effluent from the filter shall be recirculated or run to waste and shall not be fed into the pool until free of filter aid. An exception to this requirement may be made if the filter septum is of such construction that no perceptible quantity of filter aid is introduced into the pool when the effluent discharges therein. 
(g)  Where dissimilar metals are used in the construction of the filter, which may set up galvanic currents, then suitable provision shall be made to resist electrolytic corrosion. 
(h)  Filters shall be so designed and installed that they can be readily disassembled and the filter elements removed.

Replacement cartridges are divided into two types: depth and area. General specifications, however, are the same for both. Cartridge filters shall not require the addition of any flocculating agents such as ammonium alum, aluminum sulfate or potassium alum. They shall be subject to the same requirements listed under section 14-438 for all types of filters. All types of cartridges shall have sufficient structural strength to resist rupturing, channelling, collapsing, or bursting at a maximum pressure differential of 50 psi. Cartridge seals shall be so designed as to prevent any bypassing of unfiltered water. If provision is made for backwashing, it shall be so arranged as to not permit any backwash water to enter the recirculating system. No residue shall be permitted to remain in the filter housing that could be picked up in the next filtering cycle. 
(b)  Cartridge elements shall be divided into two types: 
(1)  Depth-type cartridges are elements where the porosity varies from the inlet to the discharge surface. They shall have sufficient depth to provide adequate dirt-holding capacity and be designed for a flow of no more than one gallon per minute per five cubic inches of volume with a pressure drop not to exceed two psi across clean cartridges and not to pass any particulate matter larger than 25 microns. 
(2)  Area or surface-type cartridges are those which rely on the surface area for their dirt-holding capacity and they should follow the same flow per square foot of area as diatomite filters, namely: three gallons per minute per square foot of area for pressure filters and 21/4 gallons per minute per square foot of filter area for vacuum filters. 
(c)  Filter shall be capable of filtering entire contents in 18 hours or less. 
(d)  Filter capacity shall be such that it need not be cleaned more frequently than once every four days under proper conditions of water and operation. 
(e)  All filters shall be designed so as to permit easy removal of the cartridges. 
(Ord. No. 261, § 3(3), 10-22-59; Code 1973, § 4-176)

    Pool piping shall be sized to permit the rated flows for filtering and cleaning without exceeding the maximum head, at which the pump will provide such flows. In general, the water velocity in the pool piping should not exceed ten feet per second. Where velocity exceeds ten feet per second summary calculations should be provided to show that rated flows are possible with the pump and piping provided. The recirculating pipings and fittings shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  The vacuum fitting(s) shall be located in an accessible position(s) below the water line. 
(2)  A main outlet shall be placed at the deepest point in every pool for recirculating and emptying the pool.

(3)  Being convicted in municipal court of two violations of any of the provisions of this division committed within a period of 12 consecutive months; provided, however, that remedy of the violation within 20 days of a stop order shall cause the waiver of any conviction for the original violation for the purpose of this subsection. 
(4)  Cancellation or failure to renew insurance coverage. 
Such suspension of registration shall be for a time not to exceed six months. After expiration of such period of time as the board shall have designated, and after payment of any outstanding fines and the routine renewal fee if it has become due in the interim, the suspended registration shall again become valid and effective for the balance of its time until expiration or a subsequent suspension or revocation. 
(b)  Registration revoked. The building code board of appeals shall have the authority to revoke any registration issued under this division for: 
(1)  Conviction of the practice of any fraud or deceit in securing a registration or a permit, or transferring or assigning a registration in violation of this division. 
(2)  Convictions in municipal court of three violations of any of the provisions of this division committed within a period of 12 consecutive months; provided, however, that remedy of the violation within 20 days of a stop order shall cause the waiver of any conviction for the original violation for the purpose of this subsection; 
(3)  Accumulation of two decisions of the board to suspend registration; or 
(4)  Accumulation within a period of 12 months of two forfeitures of appeals of stop orders issued under U.B.C., section 202(d) by continued work after the issuance of such stop orders. 
Such revocation of registration by the board shall be full and final cancellation of such registration and shall be effective on the date of the board's decision. No person whose registration is revoked by the board shall be allowed in the future to be registered again in the city. 
(c)  Suspension or revocation hearing. In considering charges under this division regarding suspension or revocation of a registration, the building code board of appeals shall proceed upon sworn information furnished it by any person. Such information shall be in writing and shall be duly verified by the person familiar with the allegations made. The board shall make an order setting the matter for hearing at a specified time and place, and the secretary of the board shall cause a copy of the board's order and of the sworn information to be served upon the contractor by registered mail at least 15 days before the date set for the hearing. The contractor may appear in person or by counsel at the time and place named in the order and present his defense to the board. The city attorney for the city shall provide counsel for the board. If the contractor fails or refuses to appear, the board may proceed to hear and determine the charge in his absence. If he pleads guilty or if, upon a hearing, the board finds any of the charges to be true, it may enter an order suspending or revoking the certificate of registration. Failure to properly perfect an appeal in a court of competent jurisdiction within ten days of receipt of the board's decision shall render the board's decision final. Suspension or revocation of a registration resulting from a decision of the board shall preclude the contractor from securing a permit for work controlled by that registration in the city or from becoming so registered under any different identification as long as the suspension or revocation is in effect.

Sec. 19-11. - Compensation to city. 
    A provider shall compensate the city by payment of the fees as provided below: 
(1)  Access line fee calculation. To compensate the city for the use of the rights-of-way, a provider whose telecommunications network is used to serve persons in the city shall pay the city a monthly fee to be calculated as provided below for each access line owned or used by the provider, as calculated as of month-end, that is activated for use by an end user customer of the provider or of another person as a certificated telecommunications utility, by lease or otherwise, subject to subsection (6) below or of any other person; 
a.  Access line fee calculation amount: 
1.  Following the effective date of the municipal consent, a provider shall submit to the city manager on a quarterly basis, a certified statement together with the access line fee payment under section 19-12, indicating the number of access lines used to provide telecommunications service at month end, for each month of the quarter and for each customer class identified herein. The statement shall be provided on a form prescribed by the city manager. 
2.  For each month of the quarter following the effective date of the municipal consent, a provider shall pay an access line fee which is based upon its number of access lines calculated as follows: 
Access Line 
Fee Monthly 
Calculation 
Amount TYPE (1) or (2): Residential $1.03 Nonresidential $2.64  
The city reserves the right to make reasonable adjustments to the access line fee, with 180 days notice, but not to exceed ten percent in any one year. 
Amounts appearing above are used to calculate the total compensation due the city and are not to be construed as the setting of a charge for end-users. 
(To the extent allowed by law, and not at the direction or request of the city, pursuant to Texas Utilities Code § 54.206, a provider has the discretion to collect the access line fee imposed by the city pursuant to this chapter through a pro rata charge to the customers in the boundaries of the city, including from any other persons who are leasing, reselling, rebundling or otherwise using the provider's access lines to provide telecommunications service.) 
(For purposes of this section only, lines terminating at customers with "Lifeline," "Tel-Assistance," or other service that is required to be similarly discounted pursuant to state or federal law or regulation for the purpose of advancing universal service to the economically disadvantaged shall not be included in the lines upon which the fee is calculated, but provider shall provide information on the number of such lines upon request by the city.) 
b.  Number of access lines. Subject to city's agreement not to disclose this information unless required by law, provider agrees to provide annually or as requested by the city, within a reasonable time after receipt of the city's written request, a report showing the number of access lines being maintained or operated by provider that are serving premises within the city. The city agrees that the report shall be used solely for the purposes of verifying the number of provider's access lines serving premises within the city. Upon written request, provider shall verify the information in the report and, upon reasonable advance notice, all noncustomer specific records and other documents required for such verification shall be subject to inspection by the city expressly excluding any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. 
(2)  Minimum annual fee. Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, for all new installations of facilities placed in, on or under the public rights-of-way from the effective date of the municipal consent, and for each calendar year period thereafter, the provider shall pay the city a minimum annual public street crossing fee of either the greater of: 
a.  The access line fee; or 
b.  $250.00. 
This annual minimum fee is to compensate the city for the reasonable rental value of the public rights-of-way used by the provider, and to recover the administrative cost in monitoring and enforcing the provisions of this chapter and of the municipal consent. Each municipal consent shall provide that the minimum fee of (2)b. above, may be adjusted once every three years by the city in its sole reasonable discretion to properly reflect the reasonable rental value of the public rights-of-way and administrative cost to the city, but such adjustment shall not exceed $100.00 in any one three-year period. 
(3)  Confidential records. If the provider notifies the city by a conspicuous written notation of the confidential nature of any information (including, but not limited to the information in subsection (2) of this section), reports, documents, or writings, the city agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the information, reports, documents, and writings to the extent permitted by law. Upon receipt by the city of requests for the provider's confidential information, reports, documents, or writings, the city shall notify the provider of the request in writing by facsimile transmission. The city shall furnish the provider with copies of all requests for attorney general opinions pertaining to the provider's confidential information, reports, documents, or writings. The city shall request an attorney general's opinion before disclosing any confidential information, reports, documents or writings, and shall furnish the provider with copies of attorney general opinion requests as soon as practicable that may pertain to the provider's confidential information, reports, documents or writings. 
(4)  No other fees. The payments due hereunder shall be in lieu of any construction, building or other permit, approval, inspection, or other similar fees or charges, including, but not limited to, all general business permit fees customarily assessed by the city for the use of the public rights-of-way against persons operating businesses similar to that of a provider. Further, such access line fee shall constitute full compensation to the city for all provider's facilities located within the public rights-of-way, including interoffice-transport and other transmission medial that do not terminate at an end-user customer's network interface device, even though those types of lines are not used in the calculation of the public rights-of-way fee. The compensation paid herein is not in lieu of any generally applicable ad valorem taxes, sales taxes or other generally applicable taxes, fees, development impact fees or charges, or other statutory charges or expenses recoverable under the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, or successor statutes. 
(5)  Uncollectibles. Any other provision of this agreement notwithstanding, provider shall not be obligated to pay the city for any access lines or private line termination points the revenues for which remain uncollectible. 
(6)  Payments by or use of the network by other telecommunications carriers and providers. 
a.  Direct payment-Facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers. To the extent allowed by applicable state and federal law, any telecommunications service providers who purchase unbundled network elements or other facilities or services for the purpose of rebundling those facilities and/or services to create telecommunications service for sale to persons within the city ("rebundler"), must pay to the city the access line fee that is calculated as of month-end by applying the appropriate access line fee, as specified in section 19-11, to each access line created by rebundling telecommunications service or facilities. Direct payment further ensures that the access line fee imposed herein can be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis to all telecommunications service providers that sell telecommunications service within the city. Other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, the provider shall not include in its monthly count of access lines any facilities or services provided to other telecommunications service providers for rebundling into telecommunications service, if the telecommunications service provider who is rebundling those facilities for resale has provided a signed statement to the provider that the telecommunications service provider is paying the access line fees applicable to those rebundled services directly to the city. If provider provides a copy of the signed statement to the city from the rebundler which is acceptable to the city, then provider is absolved of all responsibility of the access line fees payable on the services, unbundled network facilities, and other facilities rebundled for the creation of telecommunications service for sale within the city by each such rebundler. 
b.  Indirect payments-Public rights-of-way fee application to use of network by others. With respect to any person leasing, reselling, or otherwise using a provider's access lines, if a provider believes it does not have sufficient information to determine the appropriate rate to apply, then the higher access line fee may be applied until such time as the person using the access lines provides to the provider sufficient written information to determine the correct access line fee. If a person provides sufficient written information for the application of the access line fee, provider may, at its discretion and not at the city's request, bill the person on the basis of the information provided. Provider shall provide to the city any information regarding the locations to which it is providing service or facilities for use by another person for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers, so long as city first obtains written permission of such other person for provider to provide the information to the city. Any other provision of this ordinance notwithstanding, however, a provider shall not be liable for underpayment of access line fees resulting from the provider's reliance upon the written information provided by any person who uses provider's services or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers.

(a)  Access line fee. A provider shall remit the access line fee on a quarterly basis together with the certified statement required in subsection 19-11(1)a.1. Payment shall be made on or before the forty-fifth day following the close of each calendar quarter for which the payment is calculated and shall be paid by wire transfer to an account designated by the city manager.

(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 12, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-13. - Audits. 
(a)  On 30 days notice to a provider, the city may audit a provider for a period of time to the fullest extent allowed by law. The provider shall furnish information to demonstrate its compliance with the municipal consent and/or other provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  A provider shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts and records of business and operations that cumulatively reflect the monthly count of all access lines for a period of seven years. The city manager may require the keeping of additional records or accounts that are reasonably necessary for purposes of identifying, accounting for, and reporting the number of access lines used to deliver telecommunication services or for calculation of the payments due hereunder. The city may examine the provider's books and records referred to above, expressly excluding any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq., to the extent such records reasonably relate to providing information to verify compliance with this chapter and municipal consent. 
(c)  A provider shall make available to the city or the city's designated agent (hereinafter "agent"), for the city or it's agent to examine, audit, review and copy, in the city, on the city manager's written request, its books and records referred to above, including papers, books, accounts, documents, maps, plans and other provider records that pertain to municipal consent conditions and requirements obtained under this chapter. A provider shall fully cooperate in making records available and otherwise assist the city examiner. The city examiner shall not inspect or copy or otherwise demand production of customer specific information or any records, documents or other writings the disclosure of which is prohibited by state or federal law, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. 
(d)  The city manager may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to providers' performance of the terms and conditions of a municipal consent conveyed under this chapter. Providers shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. 
(e)  Upon written request by the city manager, to the extent the documents are reasonably identified, providers shall furnish to the city within 30 business days from the date of the written request copies of all public petitions, applications, written communications and reports submitted by providers, to the FCC and/or to the PUC or their successor agencies, relating to any matters affecting the physical use of city public rights-of-way. 
(f)  The provisions of this section shall be continuing and shall survive the termination of a municipal consent granted under this chapter and shall extend beyond the term of the municipal consent granted to the provider and the city shall have all the rights described in this section for so long as provider is providing any telecommunications service within the city. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 13, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-14. - Transfer. 
(a)  No municipal consent nor any rights or privileges that a provider has under a municipal consent, or the facilities held by a provider for use under such municipal consent which are in the public rights-of-way, shall be sold, resold, assigned, transferred or conveyed by the provider, either separately or collectively, to any other person, without the prior written approval of the city by ordinance or resolution. The city's approval shall be based upon the transferee providing adequate information to the city that it has the ability to perform and comply with the obligations and requirements of the municipal consent. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Should a provider sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any of its rights or interests under its municipal consent, including such provider's telecommunications network, or attempt to do so, without the city's prior consent, the city may revoke the provider's municipal consent for default, in which event all rights and interest of the provider under the municipal consent shall cease. 
(b)  Any transfer in violation of this section shall be null and void and unenforceable. Any change of control of a provider shall constitute a transfer under this section. However, such a change in control shall not void the municipal consent as to the transferee, unless and until the city has given notice that such a change in control necessitates compliance with section 19-14. If the provider does not initiate compliance with section 19-14 by a request for municipal consent within 30 days after the above notice has been given by the city, the municipal consent shall be null and unenforceable as to the transferee. 
(c)  There shall be a rebuttable presumption of a change of control of a provider upon a change of 15 percent or greater in the ownership of such provider. Such a change in control shall be deemed a transfer which requires consent of the city. 
(d)  A mortgage or other pledge of assets to a bank or lending institution in a bona fide lending transaction shall not be considered an assignment or transfer. 
(e)  Every municipal consent granted under this section shall specify that any transfer or other disposition of rights which has the effect of circumventing payment of required access line fees or minimum fees and/or evasion of payment of such fees by failure to accurately count or report the number of access lines by a provider is prohibited. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything else in this section, if the city has not approved or denied a request to transfer under this section within 120 days of written notice of such request from the provider to the city, it shall be deemed approved. Such time frame may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, a provider may transfer, without city approval, the facilities in the public rights-of-way under a municipal consent to another provider who has a municipal consent under this chapter. The provider transferring the facilities remains subject to all applicable obligations and provisions of the municipal consent unless the provider to which the facilities are transferred is also subject to the same, as applicable, obligations and provisions. The provider transferring the facilities must give written notice of the transfer to the city manager. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 14, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-15. - Notices to city. 
(a)  A provider shall notify the city manager as is provided in the consent agreement. 
(b)  A provider shall give written notice to the city not later than 15 days before a transfer or change in operations that may affect the applicability of sections 19-18, 19-19, 19-20 and 19-21 to the provider. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 15, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-16. - Circumvention of fee prohibited. 
    A person may not circumvent payment of access line fees or evade payment of such fees by bartering, transfer of rights, or by any other means that result in undercounting a provider's number of lines. Capacity or services may be bartered if the imputed lines are reported in accordance with section 19-11. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 16, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-17. - Construction obligations. 
(a)  A provider is subject to the reasonable regulation of the city to manage its public rights-of-way pursuant to the city's rights as a custodian of public property under state and federal laws. A provider is subject to city ordinances and requirements and federal and state laws and regulations in connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  At the city's request, a provider shall furnish the city accurate and complete information relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance, operation and repair of facilities performed by the provider in the public rights-of-way. 
(c)  The construction, expansion, reconstruction, excavation, use, maintenance and operation of a provider's facilities within the public rights-of-way are subject to applicable city requirements. 
(1)  A provider may be required to place certain facilities within the public rights-of-way underground according to applicable city requirements absent a compelling demonstration by the provider that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable or feasible nor is it equally applicable to other similar users of the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  A provider shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations on other similar users of the public right-of-way. The city shall waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the provider. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. A provider shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(3)  A provider must obtain a permit, as reasonably required by applicable city codes, prior to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation or maintenance of the provider's facilities. Once a permit is issued, provider shall give to the city a minimum of 48 hours notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of the above listed activities on its network in, on or under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the provider to request and obtain a permit from the city prior to performing any of the above listed activities in, on or over any public right-of-way, except in an emergency as provided for in subsection (10) below, will subject the provider to a stop-work order from the city and enforcement action pursuant to this Code. If the provider fails to act upon any permit with 90 calendar days of issuance, the permit shall become invalid, and the provider will be required to obtain another permit. 
(4)  When a provider completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation or other work, the provider shall promptly restore the rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. A provider shall replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base, irrigation system and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance, or repair of the provider's facilities within 30 calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the time of the work. 
(5)  Upon failure of a provider to perform any such repair or replacement work, and five days after written notice has been given by the city to the provider, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been disturbed by the provider, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the provider will reimburse the city for the costs so incurred within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(6)  Should the city reasonably determine, within two years from the date of the completion of the repair work, that the surface, base, irrigation system or landscape treatment requires additional restoration work to meet existing standards of the city, a provider shall perform such additional restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies as provided herein. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the city determines that the failure of a provider to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts. A provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(8)  A provider shall furnish the city with construction plans and maps showing the location and proposed routing of a new construction or reconstruction at least 15 days (subject to subsection (D)), before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way. A provider may not begin construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing. 
(9)  If the city manager declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, a provider shall remove or abate the provider's facilities by the deadline provided in the city manager's request. The provider and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of service. If the provider, after notice, fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the provider, without paying compensation to the provider and without the city incurring liability for damages. 
(10)  Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent harm to property or person ("emergency conditions"), a provider may not excavate the pavement of a street or public rights-of-way without first complying with city requirements.

(d)  In determining whether any requirement under this section is unreasonable or unfeasible, the city manager or his/her designee shall consider, among other things, whether the requirement would subject the provider or providers to an unreasonable increase in risk of service interruption, or to an unreasonable increase in liability for accidents, or to an unreasonable delay in construction or in availability of its services, or to any other unreasonable technical or economic burden. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 17, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-18. - Conditions of public rights-of-way occupancy. 
(a)  In the exercise of governmental functions, the city has first priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way. The city reserves the right to lay sewer, gas, water, and other pipe lines or cables and conduits, and to do underground and overhead work, and attachments, restructuring or changes in aerial facilities in, across, along, over or under a public street, alley or public rights-of-way occupied by a provider, and to change the curb, sidewalks or the grade of streets. 
(b)  The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among competing users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each user type, and to the extent there is limited space available for additional users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law. 
(c)  If, during the term of a municipal consent, the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley or public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the provider. If the city closes or abandons a public right-of-way that contains a portion of a provider's facilities, the city shall close or abandon such public right-of-way subject to the rights conveyed in the municipal consent. 
(d)  If the city gives written notice, a provider shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of provider's facilities that are in the public rights-of-way within 120 days, except in circumstances that require additional time as reasonably determined by the city based upon information provided by the provider. For projects expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, change or relocate, the city will confer with provider before determining the alterations to be required and the timing thereof. The city shall give notice whenever the city has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation of a city or other governmental public improvement in the public rights-of-way. This section shall not be construed to prevent a provider's recovery of the cost of relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for relocation or removal, nor shall it be required if improvements are solely for beautification purposes without prior joint deliberation and agreement with provider. 
If the provider fails to relocate facilities in the time allowed by the city in this section, the provider may be subject to liability to the city for such delay and as set forth in this Code, now or hereafter enacted. 
Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (d), the city manager and a provider may agree in writing to different time frames than those provided above if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change. 
(e)  During the term of its municipal consent, a provider may trim trees in or over the rights-of-way for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its network. All tree trimming shall be performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the city. Should the provider, its contractor or agent, fail to remove such trimmings within 24 hours, the city may remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of a bill from the city, the provider shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred within 30 working days. 
(f)  A provider shall temporarily remove, raise or lower its aerial facilities to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures, if the city gives written notice of no less than 48 hours. The expense of these temporary rearrangements shall be paid by the party or parties requesting and benefitting from the temporary rearrangements. Provider may require prepayment or prior posting of a bond from the party requesting temporary move. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 18, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-19. - Insurance requirements. 
(a)  A provider shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts reasonably prescribed by the city with an insurance company licensed to do business in the state acceptable to the city throughout the term of a municipal consent conveyed under this chapter. A provider shall furnish the city with proof of insurance at the time of filing the acceptance of a municipal consent. The city reserves the right to review the insurance requirements during the effective period of a municipal consent, and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and units when the city manager determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims history of the industry or the provider require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the state of texas or letters written by the provider in those instances where the state does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required herein. However, for the city to accept such letters the provider must demonstrate by written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the city, based on financial information requested by and furnished to the city. The city's current insurance requirements are described in exhibit "A" attached hereto [on file in the office of the city clerk]. 
(b)  The provider shall furnish, at no cost to the city, copies of certificates of insurance evidencing the coverage required by this section to the city. The city may request the deletion, revision or modification of particular policy terms, conditions, limitations or exclusions, unless the policy provisions are established by a law or regulation binding the city, the provider, or the underwriter. If the city requests a deletion, revision or modification, a provider shall exercise reasonable efforts to pay for and to accomplish the change. 
(c)  An insurance certificate shall contain the following required provisions: 
(1)  Name the city and its officers, employees, board members and elected representatives as additional insureds for all applicable coverage; 
(2)  Provide for 30 days' notice to the city for cancellation, nonrenewal, or material change; 
(3)  Provide that notice of claims shall be provided to the city manager by certified mail; and 
(4)  Provide that the terms of the municipal consent which impose obligations on the provider concerning liability, duty, and standard of care, including the indemnity section, are included in the policy and that the risks are insured within the policy terms and conditions. 
(d)  The provider shall file and maintain proof of insurance with the city manager during the term of a municipal consent or an extension or renewal. An insurance certificate obtained in compliance with this section is subject to city approval. The city may require the certificate to be changed to reflect changing liability limits. A provider shall immediately advise the city attorney of actual or potential litigation that may develop which may affect an existing carrier's obligation to defend and indemnify. 
(e)  An insurer has no right of recovery against the city. The required insurance policies shall protect the provider and the city. The insurance shall be primary coverage for losses covered by the policies. 
(f)  The policy clause "other insurance" shall not apply to the city if the city is an insured under the policy. 
(g)  The provider shall pay premiums and assessments. A company whish issues an insurance policy has no recourse against the city for payment of a premium or assessment. Insurance policies obtained by a provider must provide that the issuing company waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against the city in connection with damage covered by the policy. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 19, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-20. - Indemnity. 
(a)  Each municipal consent granted under this chapter shall contain provisions whereby the provider agrees to promptly defend, indemnify and hold the city harmless from and against all damages, costs, losses or expenses (i) for the repair, replacement, or restoration of city's property, equipment, materials, structures and facilities which are damaged, destroyed or found to be defective solely as a result of the provider's acts or omissions, (ii) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action, and judgments for (a) damage to or loss of the property of any person (including, but not limited to the provider, its agents, officers, employees and subcontractors, city's agents, officers and employees, and third parties); and/or (b) death, bodily injury, illness, disease, loss of services, or loss of income or wages to any person (including, but not limited to the agents, officers and employees of the provider, provider's subcontractors and city, and third parties), arising out of, incident to, concerning or resulting from the negligent or willful act or omissions of the provider, its agents, employees, and/or subcontractors, in the performance of activities pursuant to such municipal consent. 
(b)  No municipal consent indemnity provision shall apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the city, its officers, employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors. 
(c)  The provisions of the required indemnity provision set forth in an individual municipal consent shall provide that: 
(1)  It is solely for the benefit of the parties to the municipal consent and is not intended to create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any person or entity; 
(2)  To the extent permitted by law, any payments made to, or on behalf of the city under the provisions of this section are subject to the rights granted to providers under Sections 54.204 through 54.206 of the Texas Utilities Code; and 
(3)  Subject to the continued applicability of the provisions of Sections 54.204 through 54.206 of the Texas Utilities Code, as set forth in subsection (2) above, the provisions of the indemnity shall survive the expiration of the municipal consent.

Sec. 19-22. - Annexation; disannexation. 
    Within 30 days following the date of the passage of any action affecting the annexation of any property to or the disannexation of any property from the city's corporate boundaries, the city agrees to furnish provider written notice of the action and an accurate map of the city's corporate boundaries showing, if available, street names and number details. For the purpose of compensating the city under this chapter, a provider shall start including or excluding access lines within the affected area in the provider's count of access lines on the effective date designated by the Comptroller of Public Accounts Texas for the imposition of state local sales and use taxes; but in no case less than 30 days from the date the provider is notified by the city of the annexation or disannexation. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 22, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-23. - Severability. 
    The provisions of this chapter are severable. However, in the event this chapter or any tariff that authorizes the provider to recover the fee(s) provided for this chapter or any procedure provided in this chapter or any compensation due the city under this chapter becomes unlawful, or is declared or determined by a judicial, administrative or legislative authority exercising its jurisdiction to be excessive, unrecoverable, unenforceable, void, illegal or otherwise inapplicable, in whole or in part, or is exchanged for another means of compensation under higher authority, the provider and city shall meet and negotiate a new agreement that is in compliance with the authority's decision or enactment. Unless explicitly prohibited, the new agreement shall provide the city with a level of compensation comparable to that set forth in this chapter as long as the agreed-to compensation is recoverable by the provider in a manner permitted by law for the unexpired portion of the term of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 23, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-24. - Governing law. 
    This chapter shall be construed in accordance with the city code(s) in effect on the date of passage of this chapter to the extent that such code(s) are not in conflict with or in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States or the State of Texas, subject to the city's ongoing authority to adopt reasonable regulations to manage its public rights-of-way, pursuant to sections 19-17 and 19-18 or as otherwise provided by law. Municipal consents entered into pursuant to this chapter are performable in Tarrant County, Texas. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-031-01, § 24, 7-12-99) 
Sec. 19-25. - Termination. 
(a)  The city shall reserve the right to terminate any municipal consent and any rights or privileges conveyed under this chapter in the event of a material breach of the terms and conditions of the municipal consent or of this chapter, subject to a 30-day written notice and the opportunity to cure the breach during that 30-day period. 
(b)  Material breaches of a municipal consent specifically include, but are not limited to, continuing violations of sections 19-11, 19-17 and/or 19-18, and the furnishing of service of any kind that requires municipal authorization but that is not authorized by subsection 19-3(a). 
(c)  A material breach shall not be deemed to have occurred if the violation occurs without the fault of a provider of occurs as a result of circumstances beyond its control. Providers shall not be excused from performance of any of their obligations under this chapter by economic hardship, nor misfeasance or malfeasance of their city managers, officers or employees. 
(d)  A termination shall be declared only by a written decision by motion, resolution or ordinance of the city council after an appropriate public proceeding before the city council, which shall accord the provider due process and full opportunity to be heard and to respond to any notice of grounds to terminate.

The director of finance may reinstate the requirement of a bond if the director of finance determines the provisions of this subsection are not met.

Sec. 38-1. - Findings of fact; statement of purpose; methods. 
(a)  Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of Texas has delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses under the Flood Control Insurance Act of the V.T.C.A., Water Code, § 16.315. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Haltom City, Texas does ordain as follows: 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as bridges, electric cables, gas mains, sanitary sewer mains and systems, streets, storm sewer structures, telephone cables and lines, television cables, and water mains and systems located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(d)  Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter: 
(1)  Restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requires that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controls the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Controls filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevents or regulations the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-018-11, § 1, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 38-2. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and the alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appurtenant structure means a structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Area of future conditions flood hazard means the land area that would be inundated by the one-percent-annual chance (100-year) flood based on future conditions hydrology. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard (SFHA) is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed rate making has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) is the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for Zones A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year - also called the base flood. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building, which has its lowest elevated floor, raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
    Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood elevation study means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study see flood elevation study. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source, see flood or flooding. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and "floodplain management regulations." 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention or reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Flood proofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1988 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance map (FIRM) are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) see area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction [for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)], includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a "substantial improvement," the actual "start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3 (b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods or various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection 38-24(b) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter, including subsection 38-1(c). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in subsections 38-24(a)-(j), are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(Ord. No. O-2009-018-11, § 1, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 38-37. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) section 38-4, (ii) subsection 38-22(8), or (iii) subsection 38-38(3), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated two feet above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, licensed architect, or registered professional land surveyor shall submit a sealed certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this subsection as proposed in subsection 38-23(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated two feet above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below this elevation (base level elevation plus a minimum of one foot) the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or licensed architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor which are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or licensed architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

c.  Meet the permit requirements of subsection 38-23(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection 38-37(4). 
(Ord. No. O-2009-018-11, § 1, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 38-38. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
    Subdivision proposals shall meet all of the following standards: 
(1)  All subdivision proposals including manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with section 38-1. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of section 38-5; subsection 38-23(a) and article III. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 38-4 or subsection 38-22(8). 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated by a detailed engineering study for all Zone A areas, within 100 feet of the contour lines of Zone A areas, and other streams not mapped by FEMA, as indicated on the community's FIRM. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(6)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-018-11, § 1, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 38-39. - Standards for an area of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within an area of special flood hazard established in section 38-4, is an area designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one foot to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or licensed architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of section 38-39 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-018-11, § 1, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 38-40. - Floodways. 
    Floodways located within an area of special flood hazard established in section 38-4, is an area designated as floodways. Since a floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless demonstration and certification by a registered professional engineer or licensed architect is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachments would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection 38-40(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations may be allowed, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.

ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURES FOR MAP CHANGES 

Sec. 38-46. - Letters of map amendment. 
(a)  Existing structure or structures. Upon the determination of the floodplain administrator that the ground elevation below a structure or structures on a property is at an elevation greater than the base flood elevation, a property owner may apply to FEMA for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) in accordance with 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 70. Such a determination shall be based on a professional survey and/or the hydraulic computer model (HEC-2 or HEC-RAS) used by a professional engineer to define the SFHA. In this instance, no portion of the existing structure or structures (including any basements) shall be below the adjoining ground elevation. 
(b)  Proposed structure or structures. Upon the determination of the floodplain administrator that the ground elevation below a proposed structure or structures (including any basements) on a property is at an elevation greater than the base flood elevation, a property owner may apply to FEMA for a conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA) in accordance with 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 70. Such a determination shall be based on a professional survey and/or the hydraulic computer model (HEC-2 or HEC-RAS) used by a professional engineer to define the SFHA. In this instance, such a property owner shall not begin construction of the proposed structure or structures until FEMA issues a CLOMA or such structure or structures are constructed in accordance with section 38-37 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-022B-16, § 1, 8-14-00) 
Sec. 38-47. - Letters of map revision. 
(a)  Existing structure or structures. Upon the determination of the floodplain administrator that the ground elevation of a property is not in accordance with the approved FIRM, a property owner may apply to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map revision-Fill (LOMR-F) in accordance with 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 72. Such a determination shall be based on a professional survey and the hydraulic computer model (HEC-2 or HEC-RAS) used by a professional engineer to define the SFHA. All supporting documentation shall be submitted to the floodplain administrator for review and approval prior to submission to FEMA for review and approval. 
(b)  Proposed structure or structures. Upon the determination of the floodplain administer that property currently indicated in a SFHA could be removed from the SFHA through modifications of the floodplain as identified on the FIRM, a property owner may apply to FEMA for a conditional letter of map Revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map revision-Fill (CLOMR-F) in accordance with 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 72. Such modifications and the determination shall be based on a professional survey and the hydraulic computer model (HEC-2 or HEC-RAS) used by a professional engineer to define the SFHA. In this instance, the property owner shall not begin construction within the existing floodplain or the area of the proposed floodplain until FEMA issues a CLOMR or CLOMR-F. Additionally, after FEMA's issuance of a CLOMR or CLOMR-F and such modifications have been completed, the property owner shall apply to FEMA for a LOMR or LOMR-F. Such property owner shall not begin any construction of any development in the existing floodplain or proposed floodplain until FEMA has issued the LOMR or LOMR-F.

ARTICLE V. - FLOOD MITIGATION PLAN 

Sec. 38-101. - Introduction. 
    The city has initiated preparation of this flood mitigation plan (FMP) as part of its ongoing effort to provide the citizens of the city with the best possible flood protection. With passage of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, Congress authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a federal program for providing financial assistance to states and communities for flood mitigation planning and project activities. This program, the flood mitigation assistance program, includes preparation of a FMP as part of the process of identifying appropriate flood mitigation projects. The plan includes an evaluation of existing flood hazards, review of existing floodplain management activities, and a plan of action for upgrading or improving floodplain management where necessary. 
    The City of Haltom City, population 39,000, is nestled in the heart of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. It is bounded by Fort Worth on the south, west, and north and by Watauga, North Richland Hills and Richland Hills on the north and east. Haltom City is depicted on FIRM map panels 282, 284, 285, 295, 301, and 303 of the Tarrant County maps. FEMA records indicate that 243 structures in Haltom City are covered by flood insurance. 
    The city is impacted primarily by two streams that traverse the city. Big Fossil Creek generally runs along the eastern part of the city, while Little Fossil Creek traverses the southwest corner of the city. Most significant flooding problems are associated with these streams and their tributaries. The city has taken steps in recent years to address the most significant of these through cooperative efforts with the corps of engineers and with neighboring cities. 
    One of the most significant flooding problems within the city involves flooding of mobile homes in the Skyline Mobile Home Park, situated west of Denton Highway (US 377) on White's Branch, a tributary of Big Fossil Creek in the northern portion of the city. Consideration of this area will be a key component of this analysis. 
    A flood damage prevention ordinance, and a comprehensive subdivision ordinance are used to guide new development in such a manner as to minimize increased flooding risks due to new development. 
    Development of the flood mitigation plan is expected to result in increased efforts to address flooding conditions within the city. The city staff and elected leaders are receptive to the implementation of new tools that will result in reduced exposure to flood hazards. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-017-16, § 1, Exh. A, 5-13-02) 
Sec. 38-102. - Plan preparation process. 
    Preparation of the FMP is primarily a joint effort between the consultant (Teague Nall and Perkins, Inc.) and the city engineer. Input and information has been solicited throughout the planning process from a number of sources, including the city's staff, the public, other agencies involved in floodplain management, the planning and zoning commission, and the city council. The following is an outline of the planning process: 
(1)  Compilation of existing data. The city has already developed several documents that are directly related to the preparation of the FMP. They include a flood damage prevention ordinance and the subdivision ordinance. FIRM maps were obtained and reviewed, along with city topographic maps. The city staff provided input in an interview format, based on their experience in Haltom City in severe weather conditions. Discussion included known drainage problems as well as any regulatory and operational floodplain management measures currently being implemented by the city. 
(2)  Notification of other floodplain management agencies. Early in the planning process, the following agencies have been notified of the intent of the city to develop a flood mitigation plan. They have been offered the opportunity to make any suggestions or provide any input they may have related to floodplain management in the city. 
Tarrant County 
Transportation and Public Works Dept. 
100 E. Weatherford 
Fort Worth, TX 76102 
North Central Texas Council of Governments 
Mr. Jack Tidwell 
Environmental Resources Dept. 
616 Six Flags Drive 
Arlington, TX 76005 
Trinity River Authority 
Dr. Richard Browning, Ph.D. 
5300 S. Collins 
Arlington, TX 76004 
(3)  Public involvement. An advertisement was placed in the April-May 2001 issue of the city's bimonthly newsletter, the Proud and Progressive, providing general information to the public and soliciting information and feedback, especially related to existing flooding problems. Points of contact have been provided for interested citizens to call or write with suggestions, existing flooding information, or for further information. Mr. Gregory Van Nieuwenhuize, the city engineer and floodplain administrator, was identified as a point of contact, along with Gary L. Vickery of Teague Nall and Perkins, Inc. A copy of this advertisement is attached. A public notice was also placed in the Star-Telegram with similar information. A copy of this notice is attached as well. 
In addition, on August 23, 2001 a public meeting was held at the Haltom City Public Library to provide information to citizens and to provide them an opportunity to have input into the planning process. A notice of this public meeting was placed in the August-September 2001 issue of the Proud and Progressive newsletter, as well as an advertisement in the Northeast Tarrant County edition of the Star-Telegram. Citizens were briefed on the flood mitigation plan, were updated on the status of several drainage related issues pertinent to them (including the bond election scheduled for Nov. 6), and were given an opportunity to provide input into the process. Citizens shared information regarding known areas of flooding, as well as commented on existing floodplain management practices, particularly their perception of the lack of drainage maintenance. A number of citizens took the opportunity to ask about the Little Fossil Creek Project and the upcoming bond election. 
Finally, prior to approval of the plan by the city council a public hearing was held on April 8, 2002, during which citizens were afforded an opportunity to provide input and comment. The local public access cable channel televised the public hearing, as part of a regular city council meeting. In addition, CBS Channel 11 and NBC Channel 5 aired a portion of the public hearing as a follow-up to a recent story about flooding in the Skyline Mobile Home Park. In order to advise citizens of the public hearing, notices will be placed in the Proud and Progressive newsletter, the city's local cable television channel, and on the City of Haltom City web site. 
(4)  Analysis of existing problems and preparation of a draft FMP. Using input and information from the sources outlined above, an evaluation of existing flooding hazards and problems was undertaken. These were evaluated to assess their effectiveness, and numerous other possible activities have been considered. From the list of existing and potential mitigation activities a draft plan has been developed. 
(5)  Review of draft FMP by city staff. The draft FMP has been reviewed by the city staff, including the city engineer, public works director and the city manager. In addition, a copy of the draft plan has been made available for public review and comment. 
(6)  Revisions to draft plan. Based on comments by the staff, the public and the city council, the draft FMP has been revised to its present form. 
(7)  Review and adoption of the FMP by city council. The FMP was presented to the city council on April 8, 2002 in a public hearing. The FMP was approved by the city council on May 13, 2002. 
(8)  Implementation of plan by city staff. Implementation of the FMP will be primarily the responsibility of the city's engineering department. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-017-16, § 1, Exh. A, 5-13-02) 
Sec. 38-103. - Evaluation of existing hazards. 
    Significant flooding in the city occurs primarily along the major streams, specifically in two locations. 
    Review of the FIRM maps indicates that a significant portion of southeastern Haltom City along Little Fossil Creek is inundated in a 100-year storm. Nearly 400 acres, more than 20 blocks, are affected by this flooding, some of it to a depth of three feet or more. This entire area is highly developed, primarily with residential and industrial development. It appears likely that this flooding is the result of several conditions. First, the presence of backwater from the West Fork of the Trinity River, located in the City of Fort Worth southeast of the City of Haltom City, is a likely culprit. Second, it appears that there is not an adequate means of conveying floodwater under State Highway 121, especially with the high tailwater conditions described above. While the 100-year flood significantly impacts this area, street flooding and property damage have been reported in more frequent storms as well. 
    Dozens of buildings are situated within the floodplain in this area. In addition to the obvious property damage potential when flooding occurs, and the danger to the health and safety of the public, there is an economic impact as well. Undeveloped property that is situated within the floodplain cannot be developed without meeting strict guidelines for raising the proposed structures above the 100-year flood elevation or providing costly floodproofing measures. Existing structures within the floodplain cannot undergo substantial remodeling or reconstruction without meeting floodproofing requirements. The economic result of these potential flooding conditions is that areas of the community within the floodplain face significantly limited prospects for development or redevelopment. The potential for redevelopment is a key to maintaining a healthy business and residential environment in this area of the city. 
    The second major area of flooding occurs along White's Branch, a tributary of Big Fossil Creek just west of Denton Highway (US 377) in northern Haltom City. A large portion of the Skyline Mobile Home Park is inundated by the 100-year rain event. A number of mobile homes are located within the floodplain, and several are situated in the actual floodway. A sharp bend in White's Branch near the end of Piper Street causes water overflowing the banks of the stream to tend to run directly into the street. Flooding has been frequent enough in the mobile home park that fire department personnel monitor the area when moderate to heavy rainfall occurs. On several occasions, rescues have been necessary to remove residents from the mobile homes as the floodwaters rise. The most recent occasions took place in March 1998, and again in March 2002. These rescues have been made in dump trucks, which are heavy enough to avoid being swept away, as well as small boats. In addition to endangering the citizens, the rescuers themselves are also endangered by the high water. 
    While the 100-year storm leaves the banks of Big Fossil Creek in a number of locations, it appears from the FIRM maps that many of the structures adjacent to the stream are elevated sufficiently to prevent flood damage. 
    Input received from citizens at the public meetings touched on a number of issues, ranging from Little Fossil Creek to local flooding and drainage maintenance. At the August 23, 2001 public meeting in the library, citizens expressed their concerns regarding flooding at the following locations: 
(1)  Orval Court area near Little Fossil Creek; 
(2)  Dunson Drive near Shipp Drive; 
(3)  McLean Road at Old Denton Road; and 
(4)  Cedarcrest Drive at Denton Highway (U.S. 377). 
Additionally, at this public meeting, several citizens had questions and comments regarding the City's Little Fossil Creek Project. Specifically, these citizens expressed their concerns regarding the areas around Orval Court and Thomas Road. 
At the April 8, 2002 public hearing during the city council meeting, citizens expressed their concerns regarding flooding in the following areas of the city: 
(1)  Skyline Mobile Home Park; 
(2)  The Solona Circle area; 
(3)  The 6000 and 6100 blocks of McCullar Road; 
(4)  Eastridge Drive at Little Fossil Creek; 
(5)  Thomas Road at Little Fossil Creek; 
(6)  The 3200 blocks of Rita Lane, Jane Lane and Meadow Oaks Drive; 
(7)  Midway Road area immediately south of the Solona Circle area; 
(8)  The 2700 block of Haley Avenue; 
(9)  The 3200 block of Fincher Road near Little Fossil Creek; and 
(10)  The area along the north bank of Big Fossil Creek immediately south of the Fossil Beach Addition, Phase III. 
Additionally, during this public hearing, a few citizens had questions and comments about the Little Fossil Creek Project, again near Orval Court and Thomas Road. 
At both the public meeting and the public hearing, citizens also suggested increased maintenance of drainage channels and streams, and removal of debris at culverts. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-017-16, § 1, Exh. A, 5-13-02) 
Sec. 38-104. - Plan goals. 
    It is the intent of the city to develop a comprehensive floodplain management program, using existing studies and data, and updating procedures where necessary. The following excerpt from the flood damage prevention ordinance summarizes well the aim of the city in developing a flood mitigation plan. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as bridges, electric cables, gas mains, sanitary sewer mains/systems, streets, storm sewer structures, telephone cables/lines, television cables, and water mains/systems located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-017-16, § 1, Exh. A, 5-13-02) 
Sec. 38-105. - Evaluation of existing floodplain management program. 
    The city is engaged in a number of floodplain management activities, in keeping with the regulations of the NFIP. The following is a summary of these activities. 
(1)  NFIP participation. The city is a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program. As such, regulations have been adopted for regulation of the floodplain as listed below. 
(2)  Development regulation. A floodplain development permit process has been incorporated into the flood damage prevention ordinance requiring submittal of plans and other information pertinent to evaluation of the impacts of development on the floodplain. These materials are submitted to the floodplain administrator for review and approval. 
All new residential structures must be constructed so that the lowest floor is elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation. All new commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structures must be constructed so that the lowest floor is at least one foot above the base flood elevation or be designed to be floodproofed to at least one foot above the base flood elevation. 
Manufactured homes may not be placed within the floodway. Manufactured homes placed within the floodplain (but outside the floodway) must be elevated such that the lowest floor is at least one foot above the base flood elevation and securely anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Manufactured homes to be placed within an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated such that the lowest floor is at least one foot above the base flood elevation and securely anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, or be supported on reinforced piers to an elevation at least three feet above grade, and securely anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
As required by the NFIP, no encroachments in the floodway are permitted that would result in any rise in the base flood elevation unless a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is applied for and approved by FEMA. In addition, the city does not permit floodplain modifications that would remove property from a special flood hazard area until a CLOMR is applied for and approved by FEMA. In either case, the city requires the developer to obtain a LOMR after construction is complete. 
(4)  Elevation certificates. The floodplain administrator maintains a file of elevation certificates as they are made available. While the file is not likely complete, any new elevation certificates that the city is able to obtain are placed in this file. 
(5)  Little Fossil Creek. The city is working with the Corps of Engineers to develop plans for improvements to Little Fossil Creek. The target is to contain the 100-year flows within the improved channel from State Highway 121 to Midway Road. These improvements will virtually eliminate the existing flood hazard in this area of the city as described earlier in this report. The proposed approach was presented to citizens at a public meeting on June 21, 2001. A bond election was presented to the voters on November 6, 2001 to fund this and other projects. Because the bond election passed, the Corps of Engineers will proceed with their study, followed by design and right-of-way acquisition. It is currently estimated that construction will begin in the summer of 2005. 
(6)  Big Fossil Creek. The city is currently participating in a consortium of local communities to study Big Fossil Creek and determine the improvements necessary to alleviate flooding along Big Fossil Creek on a region-wide basis. Because many of the communities along Big Fossil Creek are relatively small, and the watershed encompasses many communities, this approach will ensure a more cohesive long-term plan for addressing flooding conditions along Big Fossil Creek. This participation in the consortium is a positive step toward a regional solution. While there appear to be few significant flooding issues along Big Fossil Creek itself within Haltom City, there are a number of locations where there are significant erosion problems. 
(7)  Drainage maintenance program. The city currently engages in a limited drainage maintenance program. Primarily it consists of vegetation management by means of an annual contract to spray herbicides as necessary to keep onerous vegetation in check and maintain the flood carrying capacity of the channels. In addition, the city street department staff does limited clearing of culverts and streams, primarily in response to citizen requests. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-017-16, § 1, Exh. A, 5-13-02) 
Sec. 38-106. - Evaluation of potential remedies. 
    A number of possible activities could be implemented by the city to provide to its citizens increased flood protection. Some of these are discussed below. These activities are in addition to those already in place as described above. 
(1)  Upgrade regulation of new development detention. Several changes could be made to existing development regulations to provide increased flood protection. Such changes could include a requirement that all new developments provide detention to maintain post-development runoff to predevelopment levels. This requirement would help to prevent potential increases in flood hazards downstream of the development. While a detention requirement would impose a cost to developers, which would then be passed on to consumers, it would not impose a significant new cost to the city. However, aerial photographs show that Haltom City is largely built out, except for the northern portion of the city. Detention would have little or no impact on peak flows on the major streams. It is conceivable that detention could have a positive impact on some existing developments downstream of the undeveloped area but upstream of the major streams, however, this would be somewhat limited. 
(2)  Elevation based on full development. Another regulation gaining widespread acceptance is to require that new construction be elevated at least one foot, or even more, above the 100-year water surface elevation based on fully developed watershed conditions rather than existing conditions as regulated by FEMA. This requirement primarily benefits the users of the new development, in that these users are provided a greater degree of protection from possible increases in water surface due to future development. This regulation would only benefit the users in such new construction, but would come at virtually no cost to the existing residents and/or businesses in the city, and could prevent problems in the future. One obstacle to such a policy, however, is the need to prepare hydrologic models to establish the fully developed conditions water surface elevations. Given the size of the watersheds for Big Fossil Creek and Little Fossil Creek, extending far beyond the city limits of the city, these studies would likely be quite involved and expensive. There is a strong likelihood that these studies could be incorporated into work being done by the Corps of Engineers (Little Fossil Creek) and the consortium (Big Fossil Creek). On smaller streams and tributaries, these models could be required of developers as part of the development process. 
(3)  Prohibit floodplain development. Still another regulation being enacted in other cities is to prohibit all new development in the floodplain. A naturally functioning floodplain can have many benefits to a community, including the storage and conveyance of floodwaters, the recharging of groundwater, the maintenance of surface water quality, the provision of habitat for both plant and animal wildlife, as well as providing recreational opportunities and scenic value. New construction or development within any floodplain can be considered to have a negative effect on flood conveyance capacity. In addition, because floodplains frequently provide habitat for both wildlife and plant species, such development decreases the available habitat. Development regulations that completely prohibit new development in the floodplain can serve to provide many of the benefits derived by the community from a naturally functioning floodplain. Floodwater conveyance capacity can be preserved, eliminating the creation of potential new flooding risks. In addition to reducing the loss of life and property, preservation of the floodplain can also protect critical natural and cultural resources, and provide a source of community pride and identity. This approach attempts to change the behavior of people rather than trying to change the behavior of a stream system. Rather than trying to control floodwaters, these communities are encouraging people to avoid development in flood hazard areas. However, because Haltom City is nearly built out, because it is so urbanized, and because such a restrictive policy has been considered by some to be a "taking" of property by the city, this policy may not be appropriate for Haltom City. This approach could be considered relatively radical, and introduces some controversial legal issues. In municipalities where this type of policy is being employed, zoning and other concessions are generally offered to developers to make the policy more defensible. While such a policy may be the best approach to development from an environmental and hydrologic perspective, it can be a legally and politically difficult policy to support. 
(4)  Public education program. The city may find that an ongoing public education program could benefit its citizens and make them better prepared for flood related emergencies. Regular articles in the city's bimonthly newsletter, the Proud and Progressive, could be used to provide information regarding flood protection and emergency procedures. These articles would probably be most effective during the Spring and Fall rainy seasons. In addition, these articles could be used to encourage property owners to purchase flood insurance. According to FEMA records, there are currently 243 flood insurance policies in force within the city. Review of FIRM maps indicates that there are approximately 950 insurable structures within the floodplain as it exists today. Continued development upstream of the city can be expected to generate increased runoff and higher water surface elevations. As a result, it is entirely possible that additional structures will be affected by potential flooding in the future. The official web site of the city would also be a good place to post floodplain information important to citizens. This activity will require input and effort from the floodplain administrator and/or a staff member, but given the amount of material available from FEMA and the publication schedule (bimonthly), it would not need to be extensive. While little direct costs would be involved (unless a consultant is used to provide the educational materials), it will increase the workload of the existing staff. 
(5)  Participate in the CRS program. The Community Rating System (CRS) is a program that was implemented in 1990 as part of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to recognize and encourage community floodplain management activities that exceed the minimum NFIP standards. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 codified the Community Rating System in the NFIP. Under the CRS, flood insurance premium rates are lowered to reflect the reduced flood risk resulting from community activities that meet the three goals of the CRS: (1) reduce flood losses; (2) facilitate accurate insurance rating; and (3) promote the awareness of flood insurance. 
The CRS recognizes 18 creditable activities, organized under four categories numbered 300 through 600: Public information, mapping and regulations, flood damage reduction, and flood preparedness. Specific guidelines are used to accumulate credit points, which are then used to classify the entire community. There are ten CRS classes: class 1 requires the most credit points and gives the largest flood insurance premium reduction; class 10 receives no premium reduction. 
FEMA provides volumes of guidelines for establishing the CRS in the local community. A quick review of the creditable activities indicates that it may be possible for the city to qualify for the CRS without making substantial expenditures or changes in existing programs and procedures. For example, any of the possible development regulations listed above would earn credits under the CRS. In addition, certain activities currently in place would earn credits, such as maintaining a record of elevation certificates. Other current activities could earn credits as well, with some modification of the activity. For example, a regular program of inspecting and maintaining the drainage system can earn significant credits. The program does require some relatively significant documentation of activities, which must be weighed against the benefits of the program. For example, program documentation will occupy additional staff time, as will responding to citizen inquiries and implementing an outreach program. 
Participation in the CRS program is entirely voluntary. While reduced flood insurance premiums for citizens are probably the most tangible reward of the CRS program, the activities required by the program will generally result in a better-educated community that is better prepared to minimize flood damage. In addition to reducing insurance premiums, the result of participation in the program generally is to actually reduce the community's exposure to flood damage. 
(6)  Structural improvements. There are two significant areas in the city that experience flooding, as indicated in the foregoing evaluation of existing flood hazards. The first of these is the area in the southeastern portion of Haltom City along Little Fossil Creek. A remedy for this flooding situation is already underway. As a result of the impacts of the flooding described in the evaluation section of this FMP, the city is working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prepare construction plans designed to contain the 100-year flows within an improved channel from State Highway 121 to Belknap Street. 
In addition, as identified by citizens at the public meetings, there are other locations in the city where culvert or storm drain improvements may be needed. Prior to undertaking a program that includes drainage structure improvements, it is recommended that a drainage master plan be developed to identify and prioritize the necessary improvements. A drainage master plan is also a possible vehicle for establishing fully developed watershed water surface elevations for establishing minimum finish floor elevations. 
(7)  Expand drainage maintenance program. The public works department currently undertakes a limited level of drainage maintenance. As is typical in many municipalities, the drainage maintenance program is limited primarily by financial constraints. An expanded drainage maintenance program, including clearing and removal of trees, downed branches, weeds and other vegetation, as well as dredging and repair of erosion problems, could be developed. Such a program would help maintain the drainage capacity of streams and channels. 
(8)  Purchase high-risk properties. As described in the evaluation of existing flood hazards, the second major area of flooding occurs along White's Branch, a tributary of Big Fossil Creek just west of Denton Highway (US 377) in northern Haltom City. The extent of this hazard at the Skyline Mobile Home Park is detailed in that section of this report. 
Several alternative remedies have been considered for this area. The first is structural improvements to the channel itself. However, a review of the Flood Insurance Study profiles and the FIRM map show that White's Branch is controlled by the backwater from Big Fossil Creek all the way north to the mobile home park. Obviously, structural improvements to White's Branch would have little affect on the water surface elevations without significant structural improvements to Big Fossil Creek as well. In fact, it appears from the FIRM maps that the constraint on Big Fossil Creek is a major, highly active railroad crossing just west of Denton Highway (US 377). While the railroad crossing does not appear to be inundated on the FIRM map, there is a drop of 11' in the 100-year water surface elevation across the structure. The cost of upgrading this railroad crossing to reduce this head loss would be significant. In addition, because the backwater effect from Big Fossil Creek ends in the vicinity of the mobile home park, it is likely that even with improvements to the railroad crossing at Big Fossil Creek that structural improvements to White's Branch would also be necessary. 
Because of the hazard in the Skyline Mobile Home Park described previously to property, citizens and emergency response personnel, and because of the likelihood of recurring problems in this area, it is likely that the most cost effective solution is for the city to purchase the lots subject to flooding in order to completely eliminate the threat of flood damage. Clearly, the hazard to the residents of Skyline Mobile Home Park, as well as to emergency response personnel, renders a "no action" alternative unacceptable. 
In addition to the Skyline Mobile Home Park, FEMA has identified a total of 12 repetitive loss structures in the city. At least one of these structures is situated in the regulatory floodway, and may be a good candidate for buyout. Another location will be removed from the floodplain by the proposed Little Fossil Creek improvements project. It is expected that the project will also eliminate, or at least reduce, the risk of future losses at that particular location. Several other repetitive loss structures appear to be isolated from the floodplain, and may be experiencing damage from local drainage conditions rather than stream flooding. Development of a drainage master plan would identify the cause and possible solutions for the repeated losses experienced at these locations. 
(9)  Funding considerations. A number of the possible mitigation activities addressed above will require the city to incur additional costs. It is important to consider funding possibilities if an action plan is to be developed. The following items could be considered as possible funding sources. 
a.  Property tax increase. One obvious means of financing flood mitigation and drainage related activities is through the general budget of the city. This would require either raising tax revenues or cutting other budgets, or both. Generally, citizens are resistant to such measures, and politically raising taxes can be difficult to support. 
b.  Drainage impact fee. A drainage impact fee is assessed against new developments to recover the cost to upgrade drainage facilities in order to accommodate such new development. Funds generated by this method may only be applied to the cost of additional facilities necessary due to the new development. Existing drainage problems may not be addressed with impact fees. Because Haltom City is nearly built out, drainage impact fees would not likely generate sufficient funds to make significant drainage improvements without having a serious negative affect on future development. However, a drainage impact fee has not at this time been ruled out as a possible means of funding drainage improvements 
c.  Stormwater utility fee. A stormwater utility fee is essentially a user fee, and is a means of funding drainage projects that is rapidly gaining in popularity. The stormwater utility fee is based on the premise that all residents and businesses in the city contribute runoff to the public drainage system. Users of the system should contribute to the development and operation of the drainage system to the same degree that they contribute runoff to the system. Fees are generally collected with the monthly water bill. Rate schedules can be simple, with one fee for residential properties and another fee for commercial and business properties. Rate schedules can also be more complex, based on the acreage and land use of the property. Commonly, the rate schedules are a combination of the two extremes, using a single set fee for residential land uses, and a graduated or demand based fee for nonresidential land uses. Unlike a general tax, the money generated by the stormwater utility fee is dedicated to drainage infrastructure use. As a result, there is greater accountability for the use of the funds generated, and often the residents have a clearer understanding regarding the need for these funds. The generation of regular income dedicated to drainage and flood mitigation issues allows the city to implement a planned program of drainage and flood mitigation activities, or this income can provide a revenue stream to finance a bond issue for more expensive construction projects. 
With the proper public support, a stormwater utility fee can be a key to making an effective action plan possible. Strong consideration should be given to this means of funding drainage improvements and flood mitigation activities. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-017-16, § 1, Exh. A, 5-13-02) 
Sec. 38-107. - Action plan. 
    Based on the foregoing evaluation, the city proposes to implement an action plan consisting of the activities identified below, along with a summary of how these activities will be carried out. Many of these action items are contingent upon the development, approval and implementation of a stormwater utility fee. This funding vehicle will likely be considered by the city council during the coming year. 
(1)  Upgrade floodplain regulations affecting new development. Floodplain management regulations will be revised to require minimum finish floor elevations to be set at one foot above the 100-year water surface elevation based on fully developed watershed conditions, or two-feet above the regulatory floodplain elevation based on existing conditions. This item is contingent upon either including the necessary analysis in a drainage master plan, or finding access to the necessary data from outside sources such as the Corps of Engineers. 
In addition, the floodplain management regulations will be revised to require new developments to provide detention on all lots that are larger than three acres. These developments will be required to limit stormwater runoff from the site to predevelopment levels. Surface detention in parking lots will be permitted, subject to safety limitations on the allowable depth of ponding. 
(2)  Develop a public education program. The public works department will begin to prepare educational materials for publication in the Proud and Progressive newsletter at least two times each year. These materials will encourage citizens to obtain floodplain insurance, will show citizens how to determine whether or not they are in the floodplain, how to respond to potential flooding conditions, and will provide other flood-related information of value to citizens. In addition, the official city website will have floodplain and flood insurance related links added. Because the newsletter is already published, the only cost is that cost necessary to prepare educational articles for the newsletter and web site. This could be done by city staff (at the expense of other activities) or by an outside consultant. Given the availability of information from FEMA, the time and/or cost should be minimal. 
(3)  Structural improvements. By far the most important of the structural improvements currently being considered is the Little Fossil Creek project proposed by the Corps of Engineers. Now that the voters have passed the bond election, the Corps will proceed with the necessary study, right-of-way acquisition and construction plans. 
Even with the construction of the improvements authorized by the approval of the bond election, other structural improvements are likely to be needed. There are at least two alternatives for determining what improvements are needed and what priority they have. The most comprehensive means, which will likely prove to be the most cost-effective in the long run, is to develop a drainage master plan. This plan will include an evaluation of existing drainage facilities, an assessment of needed improvements, determination of construction cost, and a determination of priority of the proposed improvements. Potential drainage improvement projects can be prioritized in a relatively objective manner, providing the city council and staff with a powerful tool for selecting improvement projects to be constructed. However, the initial cost of preparation of a drainage master plan can be very expensive. This is because it is necessary to inventory all existing drainage facilities, analyze these facilities, identify deficiencies, and evaluate possible improvements. It is entirely possible that the cost for developing a drainage master plan could be as high as $200,000.00 to $300,000.00. Preparation of a drainage master plan is probably contingent on implementation of a stormwater utility fee. 
Identifying and prioritizing the needed drainage projects can also be accomplished in a less systematic way by simply responding to drainage problems observed by staff and citizens. This procedure is inherently reactive and unfocused, and has the potential to put the public works staff in a difficult position from time to time. However, due to funding and/or staffing limitations, many communities deal with drainage problems in exactly this manner. It is unlikely that any significant cost could be attributed to this means of identifying drainage problems. Clearly, though, staff and council must be willing to address drainage problems on an individual basis, often with unhappy citizens. 
(4)  Expand drainage maintenance program. Expansion of the existing drainage maintenance program could entail hiring of additional staff, and possibly acquisition of additional equipment, depending on the level of maintenance to be provided. However, it is highly unlikely that a crew could be dedicated to drainage maintenance. An alternative would be to use existing street department staff to provide some limited drainage maintenance, or to contract out such work from time to time. The most effective drainage maintenance would likely involve clearing of debris caught at bridges and culverts, and possibly occasional dredging of silt and sediment in streams and channels. 
Minimal equipment would be needed for such a crew. This equipment would probably consist of chainsaws, a backhoe and trailer, and a dump truck. Generally speaking, this work would require a three-man crew. However, rather than hiring additional workers and purchasing or leasing equipment, this additional maintenance could be handled by existing staff on an as-needed basis, or be work that is dedicated for two or three days a month during dry weather. While using existing staff would not entail additional cost (assuming the necessary equipment is already available), it must be considered that this work will take the place of work that staff is now doing. In other words, while the additional expense to expand the drainage maintenance program may be kept quite low, there may be a corresponding sacrifice to existing services. 
In either case, significant expansion of the drainage maintenance program is contingent upon implementation of a stormwater utility fee. 
(5)  Purchase high-risk properties. Several properties are candidates for purchase in Haltom City, as described in the evaluation of potential remedies section of this report. A total of 133 lots in the Skyline Mobile Home Park are within the 100-year floodplain, of which 27 are in the regulatory floodway. All of these, but particularly those in the floodway, should be considered likely candidates for buyout. This mobile home park is primarily a rental property community rather than individually owned lots. As a result, it is difficult to determine an appraised value for the lots from the Tarrant Appraisal District (TAD) records. However, one of the lots listed on the TAD website as individually owned has an appraised land value of approximately $0.70 per square foot. Using average lot sizes of approximately 4,500 square feet, the value of this lot is approximately $3,200.00. If the lots could be purchase for the estimated appraised value, the purchase cost would be $426,000.00. However, additional costs will include appraisals, relocation assistance, closing costs, and other costs in accordance with federal acquisition regulations. In addition, because the lots are rental property, it may be necessary to offer more than the appraised value in order to address loss of rental income. 
In addition to specific lots in the Skyline Mobile Home Park, consideration will be given to acquisition of several repetitive loss structures in the city. As discussed previously, some of the structures experiencing repetitive losses may be addressed by eliminating the cause of the losses, through structural improvements or other means. However, several of these properties may be candidates for buyout. 
Upon approval by the Texas Water Development Board and FEMA of this flood mitigation plan, application may be made for a project grant under the flood mitigation assistance program. An approved FMP is one condition of eligibility for a project grant. Similar to the planning grant used to finance development of this FMP, the project grant is used primarily to finance acquisition of NFIP-insured structures. When approved, the project grant provides 75 percent of the project cost, and the local community contributes the remaining 25 percent of the project cost. Upon approval of this FMP, the city will immediately begin preparation of the project grant application for acquisition of properties as identified above. 
(6)  Participate in the FEMA community rating system program. Contingent upon the implementation of a stormwater utility fee, the city will begin efforts to qualify for the community rating system (CRS) program. Several of the other action items described herein will earn points necessary for CRS qualification, such as increasing the level of drainage maintenance, establishing fully developed conditions water surface elevations for use in regulating minimum finish floor elevations. A preliminary evaluation indicates that the necessary points for CRS qualification may well be within reach with implementation of the action items described above. However, implementing the stormwater utility fee may be the key to funding such actions, and in turn, to reaching the necessary points for CRS participation. 
(7)  Funding considerations. It is clear from the preceding discussion that many of the proposed action items are contingent upon implementation of a stormwater utility fee. 
In the absence of this or another similar source of funding, it is likely that the possible action items that may be implemented will be limited to the following: 1) revising the subdivision regulations to require detention as described above; 2) carrying out a public education program; and 3) proceeding with an application for a project grant for buyout of high risk properties.

(Ord. No. O-2011-010-11, § 1(Exh. A), 9-12-11) 
ARTICLE VI. - INSURANCE, BOND AND INDEMNITY 

Sec. 43-13. - Bond, irrevocable letter of credit. 
(a)  Prior to the issuance of a gas well permit the operator shall provide the inspector with a security instrument in the form of a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit as follows: 
(1)  Bond. A bond shall be executed by a reliable bonding or insurance institution authorized to do business in Texas, acceptable to the city. The bond shall become effective on or before the date the gas well permit is issued and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the gas well permit term or until the well is plugged and abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs first. The operator shall be listed as principal and the instrument shall run to the city, as obligee, and shall be conditioned that the operator will comply with the terms and regulations of this chapter and the city. The original bond shall be submitted to the inspector with a copy of the same provided to the city secretary. 
(2)  Letter of credit. A letter of credit shall be issued by a reliable bank authorized to do business in Texas and shall become effective on or before the date the gas well permit is issued. The letter of credit shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the gas well permit term. The city shall be authorized to draw upon such letter of credit to recover any fines or penalties assessed under this chapter. Evidence of the execution of a letter of credit shall be submitted to the inspector by submitting an original signed letter of credit from the banking institution, with a copy of the same provided to the city secretary. 
(b)  The principal amount of any security instrument shall be $50,000.00 for any single well. If, after completion of a well, the applicant/operator, who initially posted a $50,000.00 bond, has complied with all of the provisions of this chapter and whose well in the producing stage and all drilling operations have ceased, may submit a request to the inspector to reduce the existing bond to $10,000.00 for the remainder of the time the well produces without reworking. During reworking operations, the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be maintained at $50,000.00. If at any time after no less than a 15-day written notice to the operator and a public hearing, the city council shall deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, the city council may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum of $250,000.00 per well. 
(c)  Whenever the inspector finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this chapter, a written notice shall be given to the operator. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the inspector to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. After receipt of such notice, the operator shall, within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay to the city 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than 30 days unless the failure presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this chapter. The city shall be authorized to draw against any irrevocable letter of credit or bond to recover such amount due from the operator. Upon receipt of such monies, the city shall proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred other than for the expenditure of said sum in hand. In the event that the well has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the commission, such additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly plug and abandon the well and restore the drill site in conformity with the regulations of this chapter. 
(d)  In the event the operator does not cause the work to be performed and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable irrevocable letter of credit or bond the city may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action against the operator, or by criminal action against the operator, or by both such methods. 
(e)  When the well or wells covered by said irrevocable letters of credit or bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this chapter, and in conformity with all regulations of the commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and cancelled.

(5)  Certificates of insurance shall be delivered to the City of Haltom City, City Engineer, 5024 Broadway Avenue, Haltom City, Texas 76117, evidencing all the required coverages, including endorsements, prior to the issuance of a gas well permit. 
(6)  All policies shall be endorsed with a waiver of subrogation providing rights of recovery in favor of the city. 
(7)  Any failure on part of the city to request required insurance documentation shall not constitute a waiver of the insurance requirement specified herein. 
(8)  Each policy shall be endorsed to provide the city a minimum 30-day notice of cancellation, non-renewal, and/or material change in policy terms or coverage. A ten-day notice shall be acceptable in the event of non-payment of premium.

The hearing may be continued from time to time. 
(2)  At the hearing the junked motor vehicle is presumed, unless demonstrated otherwise by the owner, to be inoperable.

(f)  If a computation hereunder does not result in an increase in the amount of an annuity, the amount of the annuity will not be changed hereby. 
(g)  The amount by which an increase under this section exceeds all previously granted increases to an annuitant is an obligation of this city and of its account in the municipality accumulation fund of the Texas Municipal Retirement System. 
(h)  Pursuant to V.T.C.A., Government Code ch. 851 et seq., as amended, the City of Haltom City hereby elects to allow eligible members in its employment to establish credit in the Texas Municipal Retirement System for active military service performed as a member of the armed forces or armed forces reserves of the United States or an auxiliary of the armed forces or armed forces reserves, during a period in which the United States is or was involved in a state of conflict with foreign forces. Eligible members as used herein shall be those employees meeting the criteria set forth in subsection of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.501(a), and the amount and use of creditable military service shall be as further set forth in that section. 
(i)  In order to establish credit for military service hereunder, a member must deposit with the Texas Municipal Retirement System (in the member's individual account in the Employees Saving Fund), before the first anniversary of the effective date of this ordinance or before the first anniversary of the date the member becomes eligible to establish the credit (whichever is later) an amount equal to the number of months for which credit is sought, multiplied by $15.00, and the city must contribute an amount equal to the amount required of the member, multiplied by the city's current service matching percentage in effect on the date the member applied for credit hereunder. The City of Haltom City agrees to pay into its account in the Municipality Accumulation Fund all sums which become due hereunder as a result of the granting of such credit.

The service credit hereby granted may be used only to satisfy length of service requirements for retirement eligibility, has no monetary value in computing the annuity payments allowable to the member, and may not be used in other computations, including computation of updated service credits.

ARTICLE IV. - NEIGHBORHOOD PARKLAND DEDICATION[3] 

Footnotes:

Cross reference- Parks, recreation and cultural facilities, ch. 70. 

Sec. 78-106. - Dedication prerequisite to final subdivision plat approval. 
(a)  No final subdivision plat for any property zoned SF-1, SF-2, D, MF-1, MF-2, MHP, or PD in the city shall be approved unless such plat shall include dedication of land to the city for neighborhood park purposes. Such dedication shall be on the basis of one acre of land per each 150 residential units on the plat, and/or the payment of cash in lieu thereof, as hereinafter provided. 
(b)  This dedication requirement is formulated from recent development trends and statistics for urban communities which document this requirement based upon existing housing unit statistics and occupancy statistics per dwelling unit within like communities in the area. 
(c)  If the final subdivision plat establishes a specific number of dwelling units (e.g., single family units) upon which a park dedication fee is based, the payment of cash in lieu of a dedication of land shall be authorized and collected at the time of approval of the final subdivision plat. 
(d)  If the final subdivision plat does not establish the number of dwelling units (e.g., multi-family units) upon which a park dedication fee is based, the payment of cash in lieu of a dedication of land shall be authorized at the time of approval of the final subdivision plat, and the city shall collect the payment at the time of detailed site plan approval. The amount of payment shall be computed at the time of collection on the basis of the dollar amount per dwelling unit established by the city council pursuant to subsection 78-108(e) and in effect at that time. 
(e)  If a replat is filed, the parkland dedication (or payment of cash in lieu of) requirements then in effect shall be applied to the replat. The developer shall be given credit for any park dedication fees already paid. 
(Code 1973, § 17-41; Ord. No. O-15-94, § 1, 4-25-94; Ord. No. O-1999-003-15, § 1, 2-8-99) 
Sec. 78-107. - Cash in lieu of dedication. 
(a)  One acre or less dedication. The city declares that development of a park of less than one acre is impractical and creates unreasonable and unnecessary maintenance and operating expenditures. Therefore, if the proposed subdivision contains less than 150 units, the subdivider shall be required to pay cash in lieu thereof in the amount provided herein. No plat showing a dedication of less than one acre shall be approved unless the dedicated property may reasonably be developed in conjunction with contiguous park property. 
(b)  Less than five acres dedication. In instances where an area of less than five acres is required to be dedicated, the city shall have the right to accept the dedication of the area, or to refuse same, and to require payment of cash in lieu thereof in the amount provided herein. 
(c)  Cash in lieu of dedication. In instances where it is determined that sufficient neighborhood parkland is already in the public domain within a neighborhood park zone, or that the land proposed to be dedicated is not suitable for the city's park needs, the city shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse the dedication of land and require payment of cash in lieu thereof in the amount provided herein, or to require a combination of land and cash in lieu of land in appropriate amounts as provided herein. 
(d)  Request by developer to pay fee or make improvements. Any developer, irrespective of the size of the proposed development, who desires to pay a fee or construct public improvements in lieu of the dedication of parkland may make such a proposal to the city council who may agree to accept the payment of a fee or the construction of improvements in lieu of dedication or some portion thereof. 
(e)  Amount of cash payment required. A payment of cash in lieu of a dedication requirement shall be computed on the basis of a certain dollar amount per dwelling unit. Annually during the budget adoption process the city council shall establish a raw acreage acquisition cost figure to be used in calculating park fees. The council shall, after reasonable study and investigation, and based upon the best available information as to land and property values within the community, determine what the cost would be of acquiring one acre of vacant land in a developing area of the community. This figure shall be the raw acreage cost under which all park fees are calculated for the budget year. The amount of the fee per dwelling unit shall thereafter be established by resolution of the city council on an annual basis. The city, at its sole discretion, may establish different fees for different areas of the city. 
(Code 1973, § 17-42; Ord. No. O-15-94, § 2, 4-25-94) 
Sec. 78-108. - Size of parkland. 
    No land dedicated in compliance with this article shall have dimensions smaller than 100 feet in width and 150 feet in depth. In any development which includes wooded areas, floodplains or other natural features which are desirable to maintain, the city council may grant an exception from the strict application of these minimum dimensions whenever it determines that by doing so the protection and preservation of such areas will be promoted.

All approved improvements shall be designed in compliance with the Design Manual for Public Works/Utilities applicable to such improvements. Additionally, the subdivider shall include details related to materials, equipment, methods of construction, warranties, assurances, and indemnifications. All proposed improvements shall be subject to the approval of the city. 
(2)  The site plan must be approved by the city prior to the filing of the final plat. 
(3)  The subdivider and the city shall, prior to initiation of work on such improvements, enter into an agreement for credit of the subdivider expenses for authorized park improvements. Final credit will be accorded to the subdivider upon final acceptance of the authorized park improvements. 
(4)  Site improvements: Improvements proposed in the site plan may include one or more of the following neighborhood park improvements. Any improvements proposed by the subdivider, but not included in this list, and/or any improvements which are not needed or deemed necessary at the site, may be rejected by the city.

In no case shall the city be required to reimburse the subdivider if the subdivider chooses to improve the parkland at a value greater than required. 
(Code 1973, § 17-44; Ord. No. O-15-94, § 4, 4-25-94) 
Sec. 78-110. - Private recreation amenities. 
    If a development is proposed to be a private development where no public streets are dedicated for use by the public, the developer may receive a credit against the park dedication requirements of this article for the construction of private parks, recreation or open space areas and amenities within his development. No such private recreational amenities shall satisfy more than 50 percent of the total park dedication requirement. In determining the amount of credit to be allowed, the city shall: 
(1)  Calculate the pro rata share of the proposed private development as if it were to be a development where public streets were to be dedicated; 
(2)  Grant a credit against the mandatory park dedication requirements if the private amenities of the proposed development meet the requirements of this article;

Sec. 78-111. - Expenditures of collected funds. 
(a)  Special fund. There is hereby established a special fund for the deposit of all sums paid in lieu of parkland dedication under this article. This fund shall be known as the parkland dedication fund. Monies may be expended from this fund only for the purchase, lease or other acquisition of parkland and open space; the improvement, preparation and maintenance of such areas and sites; the installation of utilities to such sites; the construction of landscaping, play equipment or recreational improvements on such sites; or attendant engineering and planning costs associated with such park activities.

All expenditures from this fund shall be made in accordance with the city's park and recreation plan and shall be approved by the city council. 
(b)  Right to refund. The city shall account for all sums paid in lieu of parkland dedication under this article with reference to the individual plats involved. Any funds paid for such purposes must be expended by the city within ten years from the date received by the city for acquisition and/or development of neighborhood parks as defined herein. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out basis. If not so expended, the subdivider or the owner of the subdivision on the last day of such period shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of such sum, computed on a square footage or area basis. The owners of such property must request such refund within one year of entitlement, in writing, or such right shall be forfeited. 
(c)  Geographic limits of use of funds. All funds accumulated through the payment of cash in lieu of parkland dedication shall be identified as being attributable to the neighborhood park zone where the subdivision is located, and shall be so designated in the parkland dedication fund. All expenditures from the parkland dedication fund shall be expended only for land or improvements within the zone from which received, with the following exception: When the city council determines that existing conditions preclude the effective acquisition and/or development of parkland and/or recreation facilities, such as a lack of undeveloped sites, the funds collected from one zone may be expended in a contiguous zone only. But in no case shall the funds be expended at distance greater than one mile from the boundary of the zone from which the funds were collected. 
(d)  Contributions by individual organizations. Any individual organization or entity desiring to make a contribution to the park and recreation system of the city may contribute funds to be placed in this account. Once funds have been placed in this specific account, they are bound by the restriction on use of funds paid as a fee dedication requirement.

Escrow funds shall be returned to the developer, with accumulated interest, upon the filing of the final plat for each subsequent phase that contains the required parkland dedication. In addition, a reversionary public access easement shall be dedicated on the final plat of the initial phase(s) where necessary to provide effective public access, maintenance and use of any parkland to be dedicated.

(3)  Protect the safety and efficiency of the city's transportation network by reducing the confusion or distraction to motorists and enhancing the motorists' ability to see pedestrians, obstacles, other vehicles and traffic signs; 
(4)  Enhance the impression of the city which is conveyed to citizens and visitors by controlling the location and number of signs; and 
(5)  Integrate sign regulations more effectively with general zoning regulations by establishing requirements for set-backs, height restrictions and spacing, to allow for lighting, ventilation and preservation of views in a manner consistent with land uses in the various zoning districts.

(3)  Forty-five feet B/B in width and over, width thoroughfare streets-Eight inches thick, with either integral curb and gutter sections or monolithic curbs, of 3,000 psi, five-sack concrete with six-sack at intersections. 
(Code 1973, § 18-16; Ord. No. O-50-94, § 1, 1-9-95) 
Sec. 86-12. - Subgrade design requirements. 
    The following shall be requirements of subgrade design: 
(1)  Descriptions. 
a.  The subgrade shall consist of the top portion of the finished grade for pavement and/or curb and gutter construction. Subgrade preparation will be required for that portion of subgrade under pavements and one foot outside the back of curbs. 
b.  Subgrade soils shall be classified for this purpose under three classifications: 
1.  P.I. of nine or less; 
2.  P.I. of more than nine but less than 20; and 
3.  P.I. of 20 and above. 
The plasticity index (P.I.) shall be determined by an independent laboratory acceptable to the City of Haltom City. 
(2)  Subgrade preparation for soils with a P.I. of nine or less. 
a.  Wherever the preexisting subgrade soil has a P.I. of nine or less, the subgrade shall be at least six inches in depth. 
b.  When excavation or fill has been constructed to subgrade elevation, the city will have the laboratory take samples and determine the characteristics of the soil and the density requirements at optimum moisture. 
c.  The subgrade shall then be scarified and wetted to optimum moisture (-1% to +2%). The moisture shall be thoroughly mixed into the subgrade and approved by the engineer. A stabilizing agent approved by the engineer shall also be mixed into the subgrade. 
d.  The contractor shall then proceed to compact the subgrade to a value of 95 percent of standard proctor. 
e.  When density tests have been made and it is determined that the subgrade is to the proper required density, the contractor will smooth the subgrade to obtain smooth densely compacted finish at grade ( 0.10 feet). 
f.  The contractor may now proceed to set forms for either concrete pavement or curb and gutter, whichever has been previously agreed upon with the city. 
(3)  Subgrade preparation for active soils. 
a.  Soil P.I. of more than nine but less than 20. Wherever the preexisting subgrade soil has a P.I. of more than nine, but less than 20, the subgrade shall be prepared by mixing thoroughly into the top eight inches of soil one of the following stabilizations to the degree indicated: 
1.  Lime-Six percent by weight. 
2.  Portland cement-Four percent by weight. 
b.  Soil P.I. of 20 or more. Wherever the preexisting subgrade soil has a P.I. of 20 or more, the subgrade shall be prepared by mixing thoroughly into the top eight inches of soil one of the following stabilizations to the degree indicated: 
1.  Lime-Six percent by weight. 
2.  Portland cement-Eight percent by weight. 
c.  Preparation and standards. 
1.  Hydrated lime and lime slurry where allowed shall meet the requirements of TxDOT specification no. item 264. Portland cement shall meet the requirements of TxDOT specification no. item 272. In all cases when lime is used as the subgrade stabilizing agent, it shall be applied at a minimum of ten lbs. per square yard for each two inches depth of subgrade; i.e., a subgrade depth of eight inches will require, as a minimum, 40 lbs. per square yard of lime. 
2.  When the laboratory has decided the optimum percentage of lime or Portland cement, the contractor shall scarify the subgrade and spread the required amount of lime or Portland cement thereon. The contractor shall then thoroughly mix and blade the lime or Portland cement uniformly throughout the subgrade with the addition of water to ensure thorough mixing. Next, the contractor shall begin mixing operations until the lime or Portland cement is thoroughly incorporated in the subgrade, water being added as required. 
3.  The subgrade thus prepared shall be left to cure a minimum of three days for lime and seven days for Portland cement while moisture is being added as needed and as directed. After the minimum curing period, the contractor will be required to remix the lime stabilized subgrade soil again until it is thoroughly fluffed and of uniform consistency. 
4.  After the subgrade has been left to cure and has been remixed, the contractor shall compact the subgrade to a value of 95 percent standard proctor density at optimum moisture (-1% to +2%). 
5.  When the subgrade has been thoroughly stabilized and compacted, the finished subgrade shall be carefully bladed to within one-quarter inch of finished grade and compacted and rolled and approved by the engineer. 
6.  The subgrade now having been prepared, the contractor may proceed with setting the pavement or curb and gutter forms. 
(4)  Minimum depth of subgrade. The subgrade shall always, at a minimum, equal the same thickness as the pavement section above it. 
(Code 1973, § 18-17; Ord. No. O-50-94, § 1, 1-9-95) 
Sec. 86-13. - Application of asphalt pavements. 
    All new streets for dedication to the city shall be constructed of concrete. The City of Haltom City shall not accept dedications of asphalt streets, unless acceptance of the street would benefit the public at large and adequate provisions are made for maintenance of the street. Existing publicly dedicated streets, paved with asphalt at the time of this section [January 9, 1995], may continue as asphalt streets and may therefore be so maintained. Whenever any asphalt street is required to be more than 50 percent reconstructed, such street shall be constructed of concrete in accordance with this section unless otherwise approved by the city council. The city council may approve the reconstruction of asphalt streets with asphalt when the existing street is residential; has low traffic volumes; does not have to support continuous truck traffic and their accompanying loads; and when the streets in the surrounding area and/or connecting streets are constructed with asphalt pavements.

ARTICLE V. - PERIMETER AND APPROACH STREETS 

Sec. 86-130. - Purpose. 
(a)  Policy. It is the policy of the city that the developer or subdivider of a subdivision within the city or its extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be responsible for the dedication of right-of-way and the construction or improvement of appropriate portions of perimeter and approach streets which are necessitated by and attributable to that subdivision. The policy is based on the view that the developer of a subdivision should provide access and transportation facilities necessary to serve the new subdivision and that the perimeter and approach streets will provide access to and from the subdivision, thus increasing the marketability, utility, and ultimately the value of the property within the subdivision. The developer may be reimbursed for part of the cost of providing this access in accordance with this article. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish responsibilities for the dedication of right-of-way and the construction of street improvements on streets directly abutting and/or providing access to property undergoing the process of subdivision under laws and regulations of the city. This article is designed to be used in conjunction with the comprehensive land use plan and the subdivision ordinance to ensure an orderly development plan for the growth of the community and to ensure compatibility of street systems and the development of public works infrastructure necessary to support new growth and development. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-012-16, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 86-131. - Definitions. 
    Words not defined in this article have the meanings ascribed to them in the subdivision ordinance. In this article: 
    Approach street means a street other than a perimeter street that provides access to a subdivision or development. 
    Arterial street means either a major arterial street or a minor arterial street, as defined herein. 
    City standards means the street requirements for street size and right-of-way contained in the city's subdivision ordinance and this Code and the city's public works construction standards for streets and infrastructure. 
    Collector street means either a major collector street or a minor collector street, as defined herein. 
    County plat records means the plat records of Tarrant County. 
    Developer means the owner of land proposed to be developed as a residential or nonresidential subdivision, or the owner's representative. 
    Development means any activity that requires the submission of a subdivision plat or the securing of a building permit. 
    Escrow means money placed in the possession of the city for the purpose set out in this article, including, but not limited to, the purchase of right-of-way, design and construction of drainage, sanitary sewer, water facilities, curb, gutter, and pavement. 
    Frontage means that side of a lot, parcel, or tract abutting a street right-of-way and ordinarily regarded as the frontal orientation of the lot. 
    Local street means a street that distributes traffic to and from residences. It is typically short in length and may be noncontinuous to discourage through traffic. 
    Major arterial street means a major heavy traffic carrier that receives traffic from collectors and distributes it to major activity centers. It may also feed through traffic to freeways. Uses served include major educational facilities, concentrations of high density commercial, regional commercial facilities, other concentrated commercial facilities, and industrial complexes. 
    Major collector street means a perimeter street that carries traffic from collector streets to arterials. It typically serves uses such as medium and high density residential, limited commercial facilities, elementary schools, offices and direct access to industrial parks. 
    Minor arterial street means a perimeter street that receives traffic from collectors and distributes it to major arterials and activity centers. It may also feed through-traffic to freeways. Uses served included high schools, concentrations of high density residential, and commercial facilities. 
    Minor collector street means a perimeter street that carries traffic from local streets to other collector streets. It typically serves low and medium residential, limited commercial facilities, elementary schools, some small offices and direct access within industrial parks.

(Ord. No. O-1999-012-16, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 86-132. - Requirement for dedication and construction of perimeter streets. 
(a)  Dedication requirement. 
(1)  A subdivider shall dedicate a portion of the right-of-way for perimeter streets sufficient for the type of street that is reflected in the city's comprehensive land use plan and/or subdivision regulations at that location. The minimum width of the dedications shall be based on the following street standards as provided in the thoroughfare section of the comprehensive land use plan: 
Local 30' of pavement, 50' right-of-way Minor Collector 36' of pavement, 60' right-of-way Major Collector 53' of pavement, 80' right-of-way Minor Arterial 56' of pavement;* 100' right-of-way Major Arterial 80' of pavement,* 120' right-of-way  
*Exclusive of center turn facilities 
(2)  The subdivider shall dedicate those portions of the right-of-way lying between the center line of the perimeter street and the nearest property line of the subdivided property. If a subdivision borders only one side of a perimeter street, the subdivider is responsible for dedicating right-of-way needed for the one-half of the street right-of-way that is contiguous to the subdivider's property. If a subdivider owns a tract of land which is bordered by a perimeter street on more than one side, the subdivider is responsible for dedicating appropriate right-of-way for the entire width of the perimeter street. 
(b)  Limitation on dedication and construction. The requirements of this article for dedication and construction of perimeter streets are based upon the reasonable minimum standards which are designed to compensate for the effects of development upon city streets. No construction or payment of fees shall be required under this article in excess of those requirements directly attributable to or directly benefitting the particular development. A subdivider is not required to dedicate right-of-way along any one perimeter street greater than one-half of a 120 foot right-of-way (60 feet). It is presumed that any right-of-way requirements greater than 120 feet in width are designed to accommodate arterial type thoroughfares that provide transportation services not attributable solely to the surrounding development. 
(c)  Additional right-of-way. When a subdivider is required to dedicate right-of-way for a perimeter street or to construct perimeter street improvements the city may require the subdivider to dedicate right-of-way for ancillary drainage improvements and to construct necessary supporting drainage improvements. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-012-16, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 86-133. - Specific perimeter street requirements. 
(a)  Local streets. When development occurs adjacent to a perimeter street which is not designated as an arterial or collector street on the comprehensive land use plan, the developer shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Existing street. If the local street adjacent to the subdivision is already built to city standards, the developer shall, at the option of the city, prior to acceptance of the subdivision by the city: 
a.  Dedicate any additional right-of-way needed for other public improvements directly adjacent to the developer's side of the existing street and right-of-way; or 
b.  Install, reinstall, or upgrade any curb, gutter, drainage, sidewalks, signage, lighting, or other improvements as determined by the city engineer to be required by city standards. 
(2)  Perimeter street fee for existing street. If the perimeter street was constructed by a prior developer under the provisions of this article, then the current developer shall be charged a one time perimeter street fee. The fee shall be established as one-half the cost per linear foot of constructing the perimeter street and related improvements multiplied by the number of linear feet of the perimeter street adjacent to the new development. The developer who constructed the street shall submit copies of contracts to the city to establish the cost of the project that is subject to rebate. The current developer shall pay this fee to the city before acceptance of the subdivision by the city. 
(3)  No existing street; developer responsibility for construction; pro rata rebate. If the local perimeter street adjoining the development has not been constructed the developer must construct a complete 30-foot street with curb, gutter, drainage facilities, sidewalks, and signage in conformance with city standards. The initial developer is required to construct a complete street because it is impractical and unsafe to build only one-half of a two-lane street. The developer is responsible for all construction, engineering, testing, and inspection costs. A developer required to construct the full street surface under this provision will be eligible to receive a rebate of one-half of the cost of the street, curb, gutter, drainage facilities, sidewalks, signage and related costs when development occurs on the opposite side of the street. The construction required by this section shall be completed prior to acceptance of the subdivision by the city. 
(b)  Collector and arterial streets. When development occurs adjacent to a perimeter street, which is designated as a collector or arterial street on the thoroughfare section of the comprehensive land use plan, the developer shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Existing street. If the collector or arterial street adjacent to the subdivision is already built to city standards, the developer shall: 
a.  Dedicate any additional right-of-way needed for other public improvements directly adjacent to the developer's side of the existing street surface and right-of-way; and 
b.  Install, reinstall, or upgrade any curb, gutter, drainage, sidewalks, signage, lighting, or other improvements as determined by the city engineer to be required by the city standards. 
(2)  Perimeter street fee for existing street. If the perimeter street was constructed by a prior developer under the provisions of this article, then the current developer shall be charged a one time perimeter street fee. The fee shall be established as one-half the cost per linear foot of constructing the perimeter street and related improvements multiplied by the number of linear feet of the perimeter street adjacent to the new development. The current developer shall pay this fee to the city prior to acceptance of the subdivision by the city. 
(3)  No existing street; developer responsibility for construction. If the perimeter street adjoining the development is proposed to be an arterial or collector street, and the street has not been constructed or is in such condition that complete reconstruction is in the opinion of the city council necessary, the developers along each side of the street must construct two complete lanes with curb, gutter, signage, drainage and sidewalk facilities in conformance with city standards. The developer is responsible for all construction, engineering, testing, and inspection costs. Construction of the street or portion of the street, as required by the city, must be completed prior to acceptance by the city of the subdivision adjacent to the perimeter street. 
(c)  Time period for rebates. If the city collects a rebate as provided for in subsections (a)(2) or (b)(2), above within ten years of the acceptance of the street by the city, it shall pay the collected amount to the developer who originally constructed the street as soon as practicable after receipt of the funds. At the expiration of the tenth year, a developer is no longer entitled to receive a rebate. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-012-16, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 86-134. - Requirement for dedication and construction of approach streets. 
(a)  Nonavailability of approach street access. If sufficient vehicular access approaching the subdivision is not available to serve the proposed subdivision as determined by the city council, the developer must select among the following alternatives: 
(1)  Discontinue development until an approach street has been installed providing access to the proposed subdivision; 
(2)  Petition the city council to expedite the construction of an approach street serving the proposed subdivision under its regular capital improvement program; or 
(3)  Construct the approach street in order to provide required access to the proposed subdivision. The developer will be responsible for all costs associated with the installation of necessary approach streets, including, but not limited to engineering, surveying, testing, easement preparation easement and right-of-way acquisition, and inspection. 
(b)  Credit; pro rata rebate. A developer who installs an approach street pursuant to the provisions of this section is entitled to a credit for all costs associated with the installation of the approach street against any street impact fees that may be lawfully assessed against the developer for that portion of the approach street constructed. In addition, the developer is entitled to a pro rata rebate from any impact fees or perimeter street fees which may be lawfully assessed and collected by the city for the portion of the approach street constructed by the initial developer. An initial developer is entitled to a pro rata rebate for a period of ten years following completion of the approach street. At the expiration of the tenth year the developer is no longer entitled to receive the rebate. 
(c)  Oversizing. When required for the proper and orderly growth of the city, the city council may require a developer to install an approach street larger than necessary to support the specific development. If the developer is required to install an approach street larger than necessary to serve the specific development, the developer will be reimbursed by the city for the difference in cost between the cost of installing the oversized street and the cost of installing a street meeting minimum city standards required for the type of street required to serve the development. The city will have ten years from the date of completion of the street to reimburse the developer for the difference in cost for the oversizing required. 
(1)  Credit for development fees. The developer will receive a full credit for any impact fees which may be lawfully assessed against the developer for that portion of the approach street constructed. In addition, the city may compensate the developer for the difference in cost mandated by oversizing by crediting up to 50 percent of development fees charged against any portion or phase of the development. 
(2)  Transfer of credit. Upon written request from the developer, credit for development fees may be transferred from the current development project to subsequent development projects, subdivisions or phases undertaken by the developer. Such transfers must be approved by the city council. 
(3)  Time limit for payment. Any balance remaining due and owing from the city to the developer for oversizing at the end of ten years will be paid in full at that time by the city. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-012-16, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 86-135. - Escrow funds. 
(a)  Established. The city shall establish an escrow fund for the deposit of all street pro rata fees. A separate escrow fund shall be established for each street constructed by the developer. All monies received from subsequent developments or subdivisions for pro rata rebate shall be deposited into the specific escrow fund established. Funds in a specific escrow account shall be used only if the project for which the particular escrow fund was established. The city shall have sole authority to determine the timing and priority of the construction of all streets with escrowed funds. 
(b)  Payments. Twice each year on January 30th and July 31st, the director of finance shall inventory the escrow account for each street to determine what percentage of those monies is allocable to reimburse oversizing cost owned by the city as determined under section 86-134. This allocation shall be determined in the same proportion that the costs of the oversized street bears to the cost of the street required to serve the development. Upon completion of the inventory, the director of finance shall transmit all escrow funds due and owing to the appropriate developers. Upon payment of these funds, the city will receive credit for the amount of the money allocable toward its reimbursable oversizing requirements as set forth section 86-134. 
(c)  Maximum payment. A developer is not entitled to receive reimbursement for a sum greater than the initial cost of the street, less the pro rata share of the street that would have been attributable to the initial developer under this article. 
(d)  When city may take possession of funds. In the event that the city collects an escrow or pro rata fee under the terms of this article and the original developer no longer exists or cannot reasonably be located, the city may, after a period of six months, take possession of the funds and use them to make street improvements in the city. 
(Ord. No. O-1999-012-16, § 1, 4-12-99) 
Sec. 86-136. - Deadlines; adjustments. 
(a)  Time payment or construction. All construction or escrow and payment of funds by a developer as required in this article shall be due and payable prior to acceptance of the subdivision by the city. Fees or construction requirements shall be paid for all property that is final platted at time of construction of the subdivision. 
(b)  Adjustment. The city council may, in appropriate cases and based upon specific facts presented, authorize an adjustment, offset or waiver of any construction or fee payment requirements under this article where it is determined that such requirements place an unreasonable burden on the development and do not bear a rough proportionality to the requirements necessary to serve the development, or when all or a portion of the street will be brought up to city standards by the Texas Department of Public Transportation.

Sec. 86-177. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within the city. This division seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(a)  To minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development or redevelopment in order to reduce flooding, siltation and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels; 
(b)  To minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development or redevelopment to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic conditions to the maximum extent practicable; 
(c)  To accommodate new development and redevelopment projects in a manner that protects public safety, groundwater and surface water quality and aquatic living resources and their habitats; 
(d)  To employ permanent nonstructural and structural best management practices (BMPs) to protect water quality thereby raising public awareness to stormwater quality related issues; 
(e)  To remove and/or treat stormwater pollutants prior to discharge to ground and surface waters throughout the city; 
(f)  To ensure the long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater quality features; and 
(g)  To reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, to the waters of the state through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to the public.

Sec. 90-159. - Citizen Advisory Committee. 
    The City Council shall appoint a Citizen Advisory Committee consisting of one person appointed by each Councilmember. The committee shall review the traffic engineering study described in section 90-160 of this article and shall advise the City Council on the installation and operation of the photographic traffic signal enforcement systems installed within the City limits based solely on such study. The committee shall not have any authority over the photographic traffic signal enforcement systems other than to make recommendations to the City Council with respect to decisions concerning the installation of such systems based solely on the traffic engineering study.

Sec. 90-160. - Procedures for Creation of Photographic Traffic Signal Enforcement Systems. 
(a)  Before installing a photographic traffic signal enforcement system at an intersection approach, the City shall conduct or cause to be conducted a traffic engineering study for the approach to determine whether, in addition to or as an alternative to the system, a design change to the approach or a change in the signalization of the intersection is likely to reduce the number of red light violations at the intersections. 
(b)  The City shall report the results of the traffic engineering study described in subsection (a) to the Citizen Advisory Committee appointed by the City Council pursuant to section 90-159. 
(c)  Any intersection approach selected by the City for the installation of a photographic traffic signal enforcement system must be selected based on traffic volume, the history of accidents at the approach, the number or frequency of red light violations at the intersection, and any similar traffic engineering and safety criteria, without regard to the ethnic or socioeconomic characteristics of the area in which the approach is located. 
(d)  The City may not impose the civil penalty described in section 90-164 on an owner of a motor vehicle if it does not first comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) above. However, the failure of the City to comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) above with respect to one intersection shall not prevent the City from imposing said civil penalty on the owner of a motor vehicle for a violation occurring at a different intersection. 
(e)  In addition to installing the photographic traffic signal enforcement system, the City shall also install signs along each roadway that leads to the intersection at which such system is installed. The signs must be at least 100 feet from the intersection or located according to the standards established in the manual adopted by the Texas Transportation Commission under section 544.001 of the Texas Transportation Code. In addition, the signs must be easily readable to any motor vehicle operator approaching the intersection and must clearly indicate the presence of a photographic monitoring system that records violations that may result in the issuance of a notice of violation and the imposition of a monetary penalty.

Secs. 90-177-90-200. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VII. - SPEED HUMPS FOR VEHICULAR TRAFFIC CONTROL POLICY[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-2000-042-01, §§ 1-8, adopted Oct. 23, 2000, did not specifically amend the Code; therefore these provisions have been included as a new article, at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 90-201. - Definitions. 
    For the context of this article only: 
    Application for road humps includes the petition (in the format indicated in Exhibit "C") and the required applicable dollar amount (as indicated in "Procedures for Road Hump Installation, Item No. 7). 
    Low density residential dwellings include single-family houses, townhouses and duplexes with a density of no more than eight units per acre. 
    Road hump is a geometric design feature of a roadway, consisting of a raised area in the roadway pavement surface extending transversely across the travel way, whose primary purpose is to reduce the speed of vehicles traveling along that roadway. 
    Speed criteria is the speed which 85 percent of vehicles do not exceed. 
    Street refers to the street length that must be petitioned. It is a 1,000 foot segment generally centered on the location of the humps, or the length of the block, whichever is greater. If the 1,000 foot segment extends into any part of an adjacent block, it includes the entire length of the adjacent block, unless separated by an intervening thoroughfare, traffic signal or offset intersection. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-042-01, § 1, 10-23-00) 
Sec. 90-202. - Eligibility requirements. 
    All of the following criteria must be satisfied for a street to be considered eligible for road hump installation: 
1.  Petition. A petition that documents that a minimum of 75 percent of the households in low density residential dwellings on the street support its installation. 
2.  Location of the street. Seventy-five percent of the uses on the street where the road hump is proposed must be composed of low density residential dwellings. 
3.  Operational characteristics of the street. 
a.  The street must be used to provide access to abutting low density residential properties (local residential street). 
b.  There must be no more than one moving lane of traffic in each direction. 
c.  Traffic volumes must be more than 300 vehicles per day but less than 4,000 vehicles per day. 
d.  Vehicle speeds must equal or exceed the Speed Criteria of 32.0 miles per hour (mph). 
e.  The street must not be an identified primary route for emergency vehicles. Primary routes for emergency vehicles are streets that: 
-  Are the only means of access to an area or neighborhood, or 
-  Serve as an expeditious means of access for emergency vehicles to an area or neighborhood, or 
-  Serve more than one area or more than one neighborhood, or 
-  Are multi-lane roadways (more than two traffic lanes). 
These routes are limited to the streets and street segments shown in Exhibit "A". Streets may be added or deleted from this map by action of both the police and fire chiefs, when both agree to the addition or deletion. 
f.  The street must have a speed limit of 30 mph as determined in accordance with State law. 
4.  Geometric characteristics of the street. 
a.  The street must have adequate sight distance to safely accommodate the hump as determined by the city engineer. 
b.  Humps may be located on streets that contain curves and/or grades, but the hump itself must not be located within a horizontal curve, or on a vertical grade greater than eight percent on their immediate approaches. 
c.  The street must be paved. If there are no curbs, a special design must be used to prevent vehicle run-arounds. 
d.  The elevation of property adjacent to a hump location must be above top of curb, as determined by the department of public works, to minimize potential flooding due to the presence of the hump in the roadway. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-042-01, § 2, 10-23-00) 
Sec. 90-203. - Cost responsibility. 
    The cost for the road hump installation (including signs, pavement markings and, if necessary, special design features such as curbing or guard rail) is the residents' responsibility. The cost for transportation engineering studies and maintenance of the road hump is the responsibility of the city. The term resident, when used in cost sharing, does not necessarily refer to the petitioners. It is used to define the share of the cost that is not the responsibility of the city and could be paid by one or more of the residents or from other private sources. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-042-01, § 3, 10-23-00) 
Sec. 90-204. - Road hump removal and alteration. 
    The process for road hump removal or alteration by residents is the same as the process for installation. However, the petition for removal must include signatures from more than 50 percent of the households on the street. The cost is the residents' responsibility to pay. The city council finds that the cost of removal is $100.00 per road hump removed. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-042-01, § 4, 10-23-00) 
Sec. 90-205. - Road hump location. 
1.  Occupants of property adjacent to the road hump location will be consulted prior to installation. A road hump must not be located in front of a property if the occupant objects to its placement, or in the case of a property containing low density multiple dwellings, if a majority of the households on the property object to its placement. Fulfillment of this requirement is the responsibility of the applicants. 
2.  Road humps shall be a minimum distance of 800 feet from each another.

(a)  After receiving any application for such a grant, the city council shall make or cause to be made by its agents or employees, or by persons designated by it, such investigation as it may consider necessary, which investigation may include any hearings that the persons authorized by the city council to make such investigation may deem necessary, and the city council shall determine whether the public necessity and convenience require the operation of such taxicabs and whether the applicant is fit and proper and qualified and able to efficiently conduct such business and render such service to the public.

If the city council finds that the public necessity and convenience do not require the operation of any additional taxicabs or that the applicant is not fit to conduct such business for any reason, or that the interest of the general public in the city will best be served by the refusal of such application, it shall forthwith refuse such application and no grant shall be made to such applicant. If the city council finds that the public necessity and convenience require the operation of the number of taxicabs applied for, or of a lesser number, and that the applicant is fit and qualified, morally and financially, to conduct the business, and that the general welfare of the citizens of the city will best be served by addition of more taxicabs, and that all other requirements of this article have been fully complied with by the applicant, it shall notify the applicant and all holders of franchises or grants made under this article of its findings. In the event of such a finding, the then holders of franchises or grants made under the terms of this article shall be given a period of 30 days within which to add a sufficient number of taxicabs to their operating fleets to take care of the need found to exist by the city council. If within said 30-day period, said taxicabs are added and so located as to fill adequately the need found to exist, then the city council shall forthwith refuse the application and no grant shall be made to such applicant; however, if the then holders of franchises or grants made under the terms of this article fail to obtain the additional taxicabs needed and to so locate them as to adequately fulfill the need found to exist within said 30-day period, the city council shall, by ordinance, grant to the applicant a franchise or grant of privilege authorizing him to operate the number of taxicabs within the city specified by the city council. 
(c)  No franchise or grant of privilege made under the terms of this article shall be transferable without the formal consent and approval of the city council after proper application made thereto.

Sec. 94-35. - Same-Additional taxicabs. 
    The holder of any franchise or grant made under the terms of this article shall be authorized to operate in the city only the number of taxicabs specified in such grant; however, if the public necessity and convenience require the operation of additional taxicabs at any time, after formal application to the city council, the city council may authorize said holder to add additional taxicabs to his fleet. Before passing upon such application, the city council may, if it deems it desirable, make or cause to be made by its agents, employees or designated representatives such investigation as it deems necessary to ascertain whether the public necessity and convenience require the addition of more taxicabs. If the city council finds that the public necessity and convenience require the addition of more taxicabs, it shall authorize the applicant to add to his fleet a designated number of taxicabs. After such authorization, the person so authorized may then operate the number of taxicabs specified in the franchise or grant of privilege originally granted to it, plus the number of taxicabs it is authorized to add to its fleet as set out above. 
(Ord. No. 150, art. II, § D, 12-1-55; Code 1973, § 20-24) 
Sec. 94-36. - Same-Suspension or revocation. 
    If for any reason the city council deems that the general welfare of the citizens requires such action, or that the best interest of the city will be served thereby, the city council may, by formal action, and without any notice to the holder thereof, suspend for any period up to, but not exceeding, 30 days any franchise or grant made under the terms of this article. In the event of such a suspension, from and after the time of said suspension, and for the duration of such suspension, said grant or franchise shall be of no force and effect and the holder thereof shall not be authorized to operate taxicabs in the city. For good cause, the city council may, by formal action, lessen or terminate any such period of suspension. If the holder of any franchise or grant shall show by his actions that he is not a fit and proper person to operate taxicabs in the city, or if the financial position of said holder shall reach such a condition that the city council does not deem said holder able to pay in full reasonable claims for damages which might be legally established and confirmed, or if for good and sufficient reason the general welfare of the citizens of the city will best be served by such action, the city council may, after a hearing as set out below, revoke, repeal and cancel any franchise or grant made to such holder under the terms of this article. In the event of such revocation, repeal and cancellation, said grant shall be thereafter completely null and void and of no further force and effect. However, the hearing specified above shall not be held until notice has been given to the holder of the grant in question of said hearing by registered mail addressed to said holder at the address shown on the records of the city and a period of at least five days has elapsed since the mailing of such notice. Further, such notice shall specify the time and place of the hearing and shall list the reasons the general welfare of the city requires the revocation and cancellation of such grant. The holder of the grant in question shall be allowed to be present at said hearing, which shall be public, and shall be allowed to be represented by counsel, if the holder deems the same advisable. He shall have full opportunity to disprove any charges and allegations set out against him or his operations in said notice. Said hearing may be conducted by the city council or any agent, employee or representative designated by it. If conducted by an agent, employee or representative, upon approval and adoption of the city council of findings of fact made by the persons conducting such hearing, said findings of fact so approved and adopted shall be and become the findings of the city council. If the findings of fact made after such a hearing show that the operator is not a fit and proper person to conduct such business, or is unable to pay in full reasonable claims for damages which might be asserted, or that for any reason the general welfare of the citizens of the city or the best interests of said city will be served best by such action, then the city council shall revoke and cancel the franchise or grant of privilege in question.

Sec. 98-110. - Sewer rates schedule. 
(a)  Fees. It is hereby determined and declared to be necessary for the city to levy and collect service fees on each sanitary sewer connection from all persons, firms and corporations using, or having access to, the sewer system. The city council will adopt by resolution a sewer rate schedule to be set out in this section establishing a minimum monthly charge and a volumetric rate per 1,000 gallons of consumption usage. The city council may review the schedule of rates at any time and may, by resolution, increase or decrease said rates within the schedule upon a determination that said increase or decrease is warranted. 
(b)  Sewer Rate Schedule. A sewer rate schedule, as stated in Appendix C-Fee Schedule, shall be adopted each budget year. 
(c)  Monthly Volume of Wastewater: Assumption. The monthly volume of wastewater generated by a residential user shall be assumed to be equivalent to the average monthly water consumption for that customer for the preceding months of December, January, and February. If water consumption records are not available for a customer for these months, the monthly volume of wastewater shall be assumed to be the same as the water consumption for that month. 
(d)  Delinquency. Charges for sewer service shall be due and payable on or before the date shown on the utility bill. In the event said bill is not paid by the due date, a penalty charge established by the city shall be added to the bill and the connection may be cut off without notice by the city. 
(e)  Separate Minimum Charge for Separate Units. When more than one building, apartment, or other subdivision of space in any residence or commercial building is served through one meter, each such additional building, apartment, or subdivision of space shall be deemed a separate water service unit and a separate minimum charge shall be made therefore and collected by the utility billing department. In any case, such minimum charge shall be the regular minimum charge at the current rates in effect at the time of billing. 
(f)  Sewer Surcharge. 
(1)  Computation. All water/sewer accounts will be classified into one of the surcharge group classifications and shall pay a monthly sewer surcharge which shall be in addition to monthly sewer service charges. Computation of surcharges shall be based on the following formula: 
S = (C/1,000,000 × 8.34 × T × TR) + 
(C/1,000,000 × 8.34 × B × BR) 
Where: 
C = Monthly water consumption (sewer discharge) 
T = Total suspended solids (TSS) 
TR = Unit cost suspended solids ($/lb.) 
B = Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) 
BR = Unit cost oxygen demand ($/lb.) 
The BOD and TSS values for each group will be determined once every 12 months or as necessary to accurately reflect the discharge strength of the customer. The unit costs of treatment will be based on costs to the city under the wastewater contract with the City of Fort Worth. These values will be reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect the true cost to the city for charges under the contract and administration of the surcharge program. 
Sewer Surcharge Rates 
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) per pound $0.3682 Total suspended solids (TSS) per pound $0.2514  
Notwithstanding the provisions for calculating sewer surcharges as outlined above, a maximum surcharge shall be assessed against residentially owned property not to exceed a consumption rate of 11,000 gallons of expended water. 
(2)  Surcharge Group Classifications. The water/sewer department may classify all customers into groups which reflect sewage strength based on surveys of each group. The class groups are: 
a.  Food service: Includes restaurants, bars, lounges, and other establishments, which engage in sale of food or beverage, which is served directly to the public. 
b.  Delicatessen/bakery: Includes specialty food sales for delicatessens, bakeries, donut shops, and other establishments where the sale of food is generally on a "takeout basis." 
c.  Equipment services and manufacturing: Includes establishments which perform washing, cleaning, or servicing of automobiles, trucks, buses, machinery, or equipment, also manufacturing facilities where water is used for cleaning or production of products. Laundry/dry cleaning businesses are included. 
d.  Food and kindred products processing: Includes commercial establishments which engage in the preparation, packaging, processing, or distribution of food, food products, grains or produce, other than those included in group (a) or (b). 
e.  Residential/Commercial: Includes apartment complexes and trailer parks metered as such as well as all residential accounts. 
f.  Significant users or contributors: Includes all facilities identified by monitoring their sewer discharge that contribute significantly greater quantities and/or strength sewage to be classified individually. 
g.  The water and sewer department may establish additional classes as deemed necessary to recover costs from other dischargers of high strength sewage. 
h.  The water and sewer department shall assess an industrial surcharge rate for each class group based on waste strength determinations established by averaging grab or composite samples or both, taken from a representative number of establishment in each group, and shall apply this rate to the water consumption or metered wastewater. The water and sewer department shall then add the appropriate industrial surcharge to billings for regular water and sanitary sewer service for each establishment classified into a class group. 
(3)  If an establishment contains operations from more than one of the class groups, the surcharge for the establishment will be based on the highest surcharge group class at that location, as determined by the utility billing department with the approval of the director of public works. 
(4)  The water and sewer department may revise from time to time, class group surcharge rates based on analysis of current samples. Such rates shall be established by resolution of the city council.

Sec. 98-149. - Special rules relating to industrial dischargers. 
(a)  Compliance with standards. 
(1)  Applicable laws. All dischargers shall be subject to those federal, State, and local requirements and limitations which are the most stringent. 
(2)  Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process water in any way for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this article. 
(3)  Mass limitations. Where deemed appropriate the authority may apply mass limitation expressed in pounds per day of pollutant discharged. 
(4)  Categorical pretreatment standards. 
(A)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(B)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(C)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(D)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.25. 
(b)  Accidental discharge. 
(1)  Each discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this article. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's cost and expense. When applicable, detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the authority for review, and shall be approved by the authority before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the authority shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
(2)  Dischargers shall telephone and notify the authority immediately upon the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by this article. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions taken. Any discharger discharging slugs of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater system and the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the authority under State or federal law. 
(3)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit to the director a detailed written report, signed by the discharger's authorized representative, which specifies: 
(A)  A description and cause of the discharge, including location of the discharge, type, concentration, and volume of water; 
(B)  Duration of noncompliance including exact dates and times of noncompliance and, if the noncompliance is continuing, an immediate response to cause the noncompliant discharge to cease; and 
(C)  All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent continuation or recurrence of such an upset, slug load, or accidental discharge, spill, or other conditions of noncompliance. 
(4)  Each employer shall instruct all applicable employees, who may cause or discover such a discharge, with respect to emergency notification procedure including the proper telephone number of the authority to be notified. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection. 
(c)  Wastewater discharges into private sewer systems. All dischargers who discharge wastewater into a private sewer system shall comply with this article including section 98-150; provided, however, that flow measurement may be based on metered water consumption. Each discharger shall provide an agreement, signed by the owner of the sewer system, which authorizes the authority's personnel to enter onto the owner's property for purposes of inspection and monitoring of discharger's premises, and for enforcement pursuant to the term of this article. 
(d)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(1)  Bypass. Bypass of a discharger's treatment equipment or treatment facility is prohibited and the authority may take enforcement action against the discharger unless: 
(A)  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(B)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastewater, or maintenance during normal periods of downtime. This condition is not satisfied if, in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment, adequate back-up equipment should have been installed to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or maintenance; and 
(C)  The discharger submitted advanced, written notice of the need for a bypass. 
(2)  The discharger shall submit oral notice to the authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds categorical standards or other discharge limits within 24 hours of the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. Written notice shall be provided within five days of the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. The written notice shall include a description of the bypass and its causes, duration of the bypass, steps taken to prevent the reoccurrence of the bypass, and must be signed by the authorized representative of the discharger. 
(3)  The authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if it determines that the bypass will meet all of the conditions of subsection (a) of this section. 
(e)  Notification of hazardous waste discharges. All dischargers shall notify the authority, the control authority, the EPA's regional waste management article director, and the approval authority in writing of any discharge into a wastewater system or POTW of any substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Any notification under this subsection must be submitted in conformance with 40 CFR part 403.12(p). 
(Ord. No. O-2012-001-11, § 1, 1-30-12) 
Sec. 98-150. - Administration by permit. 
(a)  Classification of dischargers and permits.

(A)  Group I. Significant industrial users are defined in section 98-146, definitions. 
(B)  Group II. Commercial facilities and non-significant industrial users (NSIU) are those commercial facilities and industrial users which are not included in Group I and which do not discharge a significant amount of regulated pollutants on a regular basis. Examples include automotive service shops, small food processors and photographic developing shops. 
(C)  Group III. Classed high strength users are restaurants, car washes or other businesses which can be classed according to an average strength or abnormal strength of their wastewater. 
(D)  Group IV. Wastewater haulers are transporters of wastewater desiring to discharge into the authority's sanitary sewage system. 
(E)  Group V-Ground water remediation dischargers. Dischargers who are retrieving contaminated underground water, pretreating such water, and then discharging into the POTW. 
(F)  Group VI- Non-significant categorical industrial user (NSCIU). Facility that never discharges categorical wastewater even though categorical process(es) are located on-site. 
(2)  Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit, who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW, shall obtain such permit prior to beginning or recommencing such discharge. For Group I, significant industrial users, an application shall be filed with the director at least 90 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence. Non-significant categorical industrial users (NSCIU) and non-significant industrial users (NSIU) shall be required to submit applications at dates specified by the director. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the user for revision. The application shall contain: 
(A)  All information required by subsection (c) below; 
(B)  Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on the premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used or stored at the facility which are, or could accidentally or intentionally be, discharged into the POTW; 
(C)  Number and type of employee, hours of operation, and proposed or actual hours of operation; 
(D)  Each product produced by type, amount, process or processes, and rate of production; 
(E)  Type and amount of raw materials processed (average and maximum per day);

(G)  Time and duration of discharge; and 
(H)  Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the authority to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit application. 
All Group II, III and IV dischargers shall submit an industrial waste questionnaire. The questionnaire will be reviewed by the public works utility superintendent or authorized representative. If deemed necessary, Group II, III or IV dischargers may also be required to obtain a permit as outlined herein. 
(3)  No new group I, Group IV or Group V or Group VI user shall be allowed to discharge until issued a valid permit. 
(4)  The authority will evaluate the completed applications and data furnished by the discharger and may require additional information. If, after evaluation, the application is deemed satisfactory, then a wastewater discharge permit shall be issued within 60 days after the evaluation is complete. The wastewater discharge permit shall be subject to the terms and conditions specified herein and to the regulations of the authority. 
(5)  If the application is denied, the applicant shall be notified in writing within 30 days of the reasons for such denial. If denial is based on the authority's determination that the applicant cannot meet the wastewater discharge limitations of this article, the authority may specify that the applicant be required to provide pretreatment of the waste before it is deemed acceptable for sewer discharge. 
(6)  Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance activities will be required to comply with this article, pursuant to subsection (a)(5) of this section, the discharger shall provide a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger will provide such additional pretreatment and/or implement added operational and maintenance activities. 
(A)  The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the discharger to comply with the requirements of this article including, but not limited to dates relating to hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract(s) for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, and all other acts necessary to achieve compliance with this article. 
(B)  The time increments established between milestone dates shall be the shortest practicable for the completion of the required work. Under no circumstances shall the authority permit a time increment for a single step in the compliance schedule to exceed nine months. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for applicable categorical pretreatment standards. 
(C)  Not later than 14 days following each milestone date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit a progress report to the authority, including a statement as to whether or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that milestone date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the discharger to return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the authority. 
(7)  Prior to the approval of a permit, unless exempted by the authority, all dischargers shall provide monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and/or flow measurement of wastewaters before entering the sanitary sewer of the authority. Each monitoring facility shall be located on the discharger's premises; provided, however, where such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the discharger, the authority may approve the placement of monitoring facilities in the public street or sidewalk area. All monitoring equipment and facilities shall be maintained in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger. Failure to provide proper monitoring facilities shall be grounds for denial of a permit. 
(b)  Permit conditions. Permits are issued to a specific discharger for specific operation and are not assignable to another discharger or transferable to any other location without the prior written approval of the authority. 
(1)  Wastewater discharge permit transfer may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least 90 days' advance notice to the authority and the authority approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the authority must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
(A)  States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and process; 
(B)  Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
(C)  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit. 
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as the date of facility transfer.

(E)  Measurement of pollutants. 
(i)  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
(ii)  The result of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the authority, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in this section. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the city or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard. 
(iii)  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (c)(4) of this section. 
(iv)  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. However, the city may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. Historical data that can represent the current discharge only can be accepted as a baseline report. 
(v)  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(F)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(G)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment, best management practices (BMPs) and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this article must meet the requirements set out in this section. 
(H)  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports shall be signed by an authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional as stated in 40 CFR part 403.12(b)(6). 
(2)  Ninety-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the discharger with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or 90 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the authority a report (on a form provided by the authority and meeting the requirements of 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)), indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons, and BMPs. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. This report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger. 
(3)  Periodic compliance reports. Any discharger subject to a categorical pretreatment standard made a part of this article shall submit to the authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the categorical pretreatment standards hereof, including BMPs. Reports are required after the compliance date of such a pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge, and are to be submitted at least once every six months (on dates specified by the authority). In addition, where applicable, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow specified in this section. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the authority may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The authority, taking into consideration extenuating factors, may authorize the submission of said reports on months other than those specified above. 
(A)  In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by city or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user, and contributing information as is determined necessary to account for water usage, materials recovery, or disposal practices; and contributing information as is determined necessary to account for water usage, materials recovery, or disposal practices. 
(B)  All non-significant categorical industrial (NSCIU) shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the director. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements. 
(C)  If the director has determined that a non-significant industrial user (NSIU) needs a permit, then the NSIU shall submit a report annually in the month specified by the director. The report shall be completed according to the city's current reporting requirements, including the submittal of any applicable certification statements and data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(D)  All periodic compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 98-150(9) of this article. 
(E)  All wastewater samples shall be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring equipment in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(F)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed in subsection 98-150(c)(4) of this article, the results of this monitoring, including chain-of-custody forms, shall be included in the report. 
(4)  Analysis and sampling procedures. 
(A)  All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator of the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by EPA. Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
Where 40 CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where EPA determines that the part 136 techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by EPA. 
(B)  Sample collection. 
(i)  Except as indicated in subsections (ii) and (iii) of this subsection, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the authority may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(ii)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(iii)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsections 98-150(c)(1) and (c)(2) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. 
(iv)  For the reports required by paragraphs in subsection 98-150(c)(3) [40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(5)  Reporting additional monitoring. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the authority, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (c)(4) of this section, the results of this monitoring along with chain-of-custody forms shall be included in the report. 
(6)  Significant non-categorical industrial user reporting. Significant non-categorical industrial users shall submit to the authority at least once every six months (on dates as specified by the authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the authority. These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in subsection (c)(4) of this section. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the authority in lieu of the significant non-categorical industrial user. 
(7)  Notification of changed discharge. Dischargers shall give prior written notification to the authority and City of Fort Worth of any potential or actual significant changes in the volume or character of pollutants in the discharge and any changes at its facility that affect the potential for a slug discharge. 
(A)  The notification to the authority shall be received at least 90 days prior to change. 
(B)  The authority may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
(C)  The authority may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(D)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases or decreases of 20 percent or greater, the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, and the deletion of any pollutant regulated by this article or a permit issued pursuant to this article. 
(8)  Authority monitoring. Sampling and analysis for the reports required by subsections (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(6) of this section, may be performed by the authority in lieu of the discharger. If all information required for the report, including flow data, is collected by the authority, the discharger will be required to submit the report or certifications. 
(9)  Signatory requirements. All applications and compliance reports submitted to the authority must contain the following certification statement and be signed by the authorized representative: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information and for not reporting known violations, including possibility of fine and imprisonment." 
Annual certification for non-significant categorical industrial users-A facility determined to be a non-significant categorical industrial user by the director pursuant to section 98-146 and subsection 98-150(a)(1) must annually submit the following certification statement signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in (40 CFR 403.120(I)). This certification must accompany an alternative report required by the director: 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR ;daterule;, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from ;daterule;, ;daterule; to ;daterule;, ;daterule; [months, days, year]: 
(A)  The facility described as ;daterule; [facility name] met the definition of a non-significant categorical industrial user as described section 98-146 and subsection 98-150(a)(1). 
(B)  The facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards and requirements during this reporting period; and 
(C)  The facility never discharged categorical process wastewater on any given day during this reporting period. 
This compliance certification is based on the following information: 
_____
_____
(10)  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the authority, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 30 days of the request. The authority is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
(d)  Inspection and flow measurement. 
(1)  Inspection. At least once a year, the director shall inspect and sample each significant industrial user (SIU, NSCIU and NSIU). However, the director may inspect and sample each SIU as frequently as needed during the pretreatment year. The director shall evaluate whether each SIU needs a plan to control slug discharges at the time of SIU determination, or at least by the first year. This assessment shall be documented as part of the records. 
(A)  The authority may inspect the facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of this article. The discharger shall allow the authority or its representatives to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours for the purposes of inspection, sampling, or examination of records. All reports and records related to the provisions of this article shall be made available for copying and inspection by the authority. The discharger shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples and analysis and whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities should be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications, and such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner so as to enable the city to perform independent monitoring activities. The authority shall have the right to set upon the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and metering or measuring operations. The inspectors, agents or representatives of the authority charged with the enforcement of this article shall be deemed to be performing a governmental function for the benefit and health and welfare of the general public and neither the authority nor any individual inspector, agent or representative shall be held liable for any loss or damage, whether real or asserted, caused or alleged to have been caused as a result of the performance of such governmental function. The failure or refusal of such owner or discharger to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the disconnection of water or sewer service to the facility. If entry is denied or a person in control cannot be located, the director shall have every recourse provided by law to secure entry. Such recourse shall include the right to obtain a search warrant under the guidelines of the Texas Code of Criminal procedure; and for the purposes of same, any person with enforcement authority under this chapter is hereby declared to be a "health officer." 
(B)  Facilities regulated under this article are subject to the authority of the following agencies concerning access to information and right of entry onto property for purposes of implementing and enforcing federal and State pretreatment programs and other applicable law: 
(i)  The EPA under Section 308 of the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. section 3318), as amended; and 
(ii)  The state commission on environmental quality (TCEQ) under V.T.C.A., Texas Water Code §§ 26.014 and 26.015, as amended, and V.T.C.A., Texas Health and Safety Code §§ 361.032 and 361.037, as amended, provisions of the Texas Water Code and Texas Health Safety Code. 
(C)  The industrial waste discharged or deposited into the sanitary sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection and sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by the authority. Samples shall be collected in such manner as to be representative of the character and concentration of the waste under operational conditions. The laboratory methods used in the examination of said waste shall be those set forth in 40 CFR part 136. The determination of the character and concentration of industrial waste shall be made at such times and on such schedules as may be established by the authority. Should a discharger desire a determination of the quality of such industrial waste be made at some time other than that scheduled by the authority, such special determination may be made by the authority at the expense of the owner or discharger. 
(D)  The authority shall conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards. The authority shall inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once a year. The result of such activities shall be available to the approval authority upon request. 
(2)  NOV/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample if: 
(A)  The authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
(B)  The authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(3)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used in computing sewage charges shall be based upon metered water consumption or discharge as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the city's water department. 
(A)  Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director that a substantial portion of the metered water does not enter the sanitary sewer, the director may require or permit the installation of additional approved meters at the owner's expense, to measure the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system. If approved by the director, the measured quantity of water actually entering the sewer system will be used to determine the sewer service charge. 
(B)  Any discharger who procures all or part of its water supply from sources other than the city's water department, all or part of which is subsequently discharged into the sanitary sewer, shall install and maintain at its expense an effluent meter or flow measuring device approved by the director for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing sewer service charges. Such meters or measuring devices shall be read monthly. 
(C)  If the director determines that it is not practicable to measure the quantity or quality of waste by the aforesaid meters or monitoring devices, the quantity or quality of the waste shall be determined in any manner or method the director may find practicable in order to arrive at the percentage of water entering the sanitary sewage system of the authority and/or the quality of the sewage to be used to determine the sewer service charge. 
(e)  Permit modifications. 
(1)  The authority reserves the right to amend any permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by the authority with applicable laws and regulations. The authority may amend any permit for good cause including, but not limited to the following: 
(A)  To incorporate any new or revised federal, State, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(B)  Material or substantial alterations or additions to the discharger's operation processes, or discharge volume or character which were not considered in drafting the effective permit. 
(C)  A change in any condition in either the industrial user or the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge. 
(D)  Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the authority's collection and treatment systems, POTW personnel or the receiving waters. 
(E)  Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit. 
(F)  Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts in the permit application or in any required reporting. 
(G)  To correct typographical or other errors in the permit. 
(H)  To reflect transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to a new owner/operator. 
(I)  Upon request of the permittee, provided such request does not create a violation of any applicable requirements, standards, laws, or rules and regulations. 
(J)  To incorporate, revise, or revoke new or existing best management practices. 
(2)  All categorical pretreatment standards promulgated and adopted by the EPA after the effective date of this article (Ordinance Number O-2012-001-11 adopted January 30, 2012) shall automatically become a part of this article. Where a discharger, subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted an application for a permit as required by subsection (a)(2) of this section, the discharger shall apply for a permit from the authority within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable categorical pretreatment standard by the EPA. In addition, the discharger with an existing permit shall submit to the authority within 180 days after promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, the information required by subsection (c)(1) of this section. The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(f)  Confidential information. 
(1)  All information and data submitted by a discharger to the authority or POTW may be submitted to any state or federal agency governing the POTW. Such information shall be considered subject to public disclosure, provided, however, that the discharger may request that information not be subject to public disclosure, in accordance with 40 CFR part 2 as follows: 
(A)  A discharger may assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information in a manner described below, and that information covered by such a claim will be disclosed only by means of the procedures set forth below. 
(B)  If no claim of business confidentiality is asserted, all information will be subject to public disclosure without further notice to the discharger. 
(2)  Asserting business confidentiality claim. A discharger which is submitting information to the authority may assert a business confidentiality claim covering the information by placing on or attaching to the information, at the time it is submitted to the authority, a cover sheet, stamped or typed legend, or other suitable form of notice employing language such as "trade secret," "proprietary," or "company confidential." Allegedly confidential portions of otherwise non-confidential documents should be clearly identified by the discharger, and may be submitted separately to facilitate identification and handling by the authority. If the discharger desires confidential treatment only until a certain date or until the occurrence of a certain event, the notice should so state. 
(3)  Nothing in this article shall prevent the disclosure of information and data regarding the nature and content of a discharger's effluent, and the frequency of discharge, or a standard or limitation to be met by the discharger, and this information shall be available to the public with no restrictions. Effluent data which cannot be held as confidential is as defined in 40 CFR 2.302. 
(4)  The provisions of this subsection shall be subject to any public disclosure requirements which may exist under the Texas Public Information Act, Chapter 552 of the Texas Government Code, as amended. 
(g)  Wastewater discharge permit reissuance. A user with an expiring wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section, a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit.

(C)  The user pays the city for all costs the city will incur in reinstating services. 
(4)  Exercise of the authority by the director under this subsection shall not be a bar to, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(c)  Administrative orders. Where the violation of subsection (a) of this section is not corrected by means of enforcement action listed in subsection (b) of this section, the following enforcement escalations may be used. Terms may or may not be negotiated with industrial users. 
(1)  Consent order. An agreement between the authority and the industrial user normally containing three elements: 
(A)  Compliance schedules; 
(B)  Stipulated fines or remedial actions; and 
(C)  Signatures of the authority and authorized representatives. 
(2)  Show cause order. An order which directs the user to appear before the city to explain its noncompliance and show cause why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not be levied. Typically used after informal contacts or NOV's have failed to resolve noncompliance; however, it can be used at any time. 
(3)  Compliance order. An order which directs the industrial user to achieve or restore compliance by a date specified in the order. Terms need not be discussed with the industry in advance. Typically used when noncompliance cannot be resolved without construction, repair, or process changes, or to require development of management practices, spill prevention programs, and other pretreatment program requirements. 
(d)  Right of appeal of administrative ruling. Any discharger or any interested party shall have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the authority on any matter covered by this article and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters of performance or compliance with this article or deals with a permit issued pursuant hereto for which enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger's request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid written reply; provided, however, the authority may take any action it deems necessary to protect its wastewater collection and treatment system or to comply with its TPDES permit or to comply with any contract the authority has for the treatment of wastewater. 
(e)  Judicial proceedings. The authority, with respect to the conduct of any discharger contrary to the provisions of this article may authorize its attorney to commence any legal action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable and/or legal relief. 
(1)  Injunctive relief. When the authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the authority may petition, pursuant to chapter 54 a district court or other court of proper jurisdiction of the county through its attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunction relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(2)  Civil penalties. The authority may also seek to recover civil penalties of up to $5,000.00 per day pursuant to V.T.C.A., Texas Local Government Code § 54.018. 
(3)  Criminal proceedings. Notwithstanding any notice provisions contained in this article, any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this article commits an offense. The person shall be fined not more than $2,000.00 for each offense. 
(f)  Emergency suspension of service and discharge permits. 
(1)  The authority, may, for good cause shown, suspend water or wastewater service to the discharger's facility when it appears to the authority that an actual or threatened discharge presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the environment, interfere with the operation of a POTW, violate any pretreatment limits imposed by this article or any permit issued pursuant to this article. Any discharger notified of the suspension of the authority's water or wastewater service and/or the discharger's permit, shall within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the authority, cease all discharges. In the event of the failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the authority may commence judicial proceedings to compel the discharger's compliance with such order or may immediately disconnect such discharger's service line from the city water and sanitary sewer system. In the case of emergency disconnection of service, the director shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner or discharger before disconnecting the service line. The party whose service has been disconnected shall have an opportunity for a hearing on the issue of the illegal discharge and the disconnection as soon as possible after such disconnection has taken place. 
(2)  The authority may reinstate the permit and/or the wastewater or water service upon proof by the discharger of the cessation of the noncomplying discharge or elimination of conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above. The water and/or wastewater service shall be reconnected at the discharger's expense. 
(g)  Affirmative defenses. 
(1)  Affirmative defenses to discharge violations for action in municipal or state court. In an action brought in municipal or state court, if a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of this article or a permit issued under this article was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation of this article or the permit. In an enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe shall have the burden of proof. In the event that an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe has been established the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent possible until such time as the reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. 
(2)  Affirmative defenses to upset. In an action brought in federal court, it is an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards that the noncompliance was caused by upset, if the user demonstrates, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and any discharger who experiences an upset in operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this article shall inform the authority within 24 hours of first awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where such information is given orally, the authority may at its discretion require the discharger to file a written report within five working days. The report shall specify: 
(A)  Description of the upset, its cause and the upset's impact on a discharger's compliance status. 
(B)  Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to occur. 
(C)  All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance. 
(3)  Affirmative defenses to specific prohibited discharge standards. It is an affirmative defense in federal court to an enforcement action brought against a user for noncompliance with the general prohibitions of subsection 98-148(b) or a specific prohibition of subsection 98-148(d) that the user did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(A)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(B)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(h)  Recovery of costs incurred by the authority. Any discharger who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the authority's wastewater system, shall be liable to the authority for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The authority shall bill the discharger for the costs incurred by the authority for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Failure to pay such bill may result in the termination of water or wastewater service. 
(i)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article, or falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in subsection (e)(3) of this section. 
(j)  POTW pretreatment requirements. All POTW's shall be able to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and requirements. All POTW's shall also have authority to seek or assess civil or criminal penalties in at least the amount of $1,000.00 a day for each violation by industrial users of pretreatment standards and requirements. POTW's whose approved pretreatment programs require modification to conform to the requirements of this subsection shall submit a request for approval of a program modification in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.18, unless the State would be required to enact or amend a statutory provision, in which case the POTW shall submit such a request. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-001-11, § 1, 1-30-12) 
Sec. 98-152. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Net/gross calculations. The authority may elect to adjust categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in the discharger's intake water, in accordance with 40 CFR part 403.15. 
(b)  Preservation of records. All dischargers subject to this article shall retain and preserve for no less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence, documentation associated with best management practices and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by or on behalf of a discharger in connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the authority pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired. 
(c)  Costs of administering program. The authority may make such charges, known as monitoring and pretreatment charges, as are reasonable for services rendered in administering the programs outlined in this article. Such charges may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Permitting industrial facilities; 
(2)  Inspection; 
(3)  Sample analysis; 
(4)  Monitoring; and 
(5)  Enforcement. 
(d)  Right of revision. The authority reserves the right to amend this article to provide for more or less stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the sanitary sewer or POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in section 98-147 of this article. 
(e)  Publication of list of significant violators. The authority shall annually publish in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the city a list of users that have significantly violated federal pretreatment requirements during the previous 12 months. Definition of significant violation shall be the definitions listed in 40 CFR part 403.8(f)(2)(viii), and in the POTW's TPDES permit. The director, or the director's designee, shall be responsible for calculating the users who have committed significant violations. 
    Significant industrial users are subject to the SNC criteria listed in subsections (1) through (8) of this subsection. Group II non-significant industrial users that have been issued a permit shall be subject to SNC criteria listed in subsections (3) through (8) of this subsection. Group VI non-significant categorical industrial users shall be subject to SNC criteria listed in subsections (3) through (8) of this subsection. All other industrial users are subject to the SNC criteria listed in subsections (3), (4) and (8) of this subsection. 
    Significant non-compliance shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(I) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit or a narrative standard) that the director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;

Secs. 98-153-98-170. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - PRETREATMENT PROGRAM AND ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE PLAN 

Sec. 98-171. - Purpose. 
    The City Council of the City of Haltom City ("City") finds that the unregulated discharge of liquid waste presents a hazard to the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. The city provides wastewater utility service through a wholesale wastewater contract with the City of Fort Worth. As a wholesale customer of the City of Fort Worth, the City agrees to comply with all permit conditions in any way relating to the collection system and the discharge into the collection system. Accordingly, the City of Haltom City must comply with state law and regulations regarding pretreatment standards and requirements. 
    The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures to be followed by the city's environmental services division ("division") staff in identifying, documenting, and responding to pretreatment program violations. To promote consistent enforcement of the City's pretreatment standards and requirements, the city council has authorized the director of public works or his/her designee ("director") to develop and implement an enforcement response plan via article IV "industrial wastewater" of chapter 98 of the City Code and promulgate regulations that are consistent with and necessary for the administration and enforcement of the industrial waste provisions of the City Code. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-001-11, § 2(1), 1-30-12) 
Sec. 98-172. - Elements of the plan. 
    A comprehensive and effective enforcement plan must reflect the City of Haltom City's primary responsibility to enforce all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. As such, this enforcement response plan consists of (1) an industrial user or "master" inventory; (2) compliance tracking; and (3) enforcement response criteria and guidelines. The city has a contract with the City of Fort Worth to provide personnel and testing services in implementing its enforcement response plan. 
2.1  Master industrial user inventory. An initial component of an enforcement plan is the industrial user inventory. The general pretreatment regulations require that an updated list of industrial users be submitted on an annual basis by the control authority to the approval authority, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ") in the year-end report. This industrial user inventory must indicate whether these industries are regulated by categorical standards, local limits, or both the categorical and local limits. 
Personnel will be assigned to keep the industrial user or "master" inventory accurate and up-to-date. The master inventory will be reviewed and periodically updated, as needed. The master inventory will be maintained in the pretreatment files and a current copy will be provided annually to the Director and the Manager of the Pretreatment Services Division of the City of Fort Worth in January and July of each year. 
The following will be available and utilized in maintaining an accurate master inventory: 
  City water records for commercial/industrial accounts; 
  Periodic review of area telephone books; 
  Periodic review of the manufacturing directories and the manufacturer's registers; 
  Physical inspections of commercial areas and industrial parks; 
  Contact and communication with city departments, (i.e. plumbing inspection occupancy permits) to learn of new connections; and 
  Industrial user survey questionnaires. These questionnaires are to be completed by all users identified on the master inventory. 
Users on the master inventory will be identified as to whether they are significant industrial users (SIUs) according to 40 CFR Part 403.3(v)(1), or a non-significant categorical industrial user (NSCIU) based on the criteria listed in subsection 98-150(a)(1) of the City Code. 
Upon a finding that a SIU identified under Part 403 has no potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority (City of Fort Worth) may determine that such industrial user is not a significant industrial user. However, the city may, at its own discretion, issue a non-significant industrial user (NSIU) permit to the facility. 
Permitted industrial users (SIU, NSCIU, NSIU) will be subject to the city's pretreatment program in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.8 pretreatment program requirements and chapter 98, article IV of the City Code. Monitoring and sampling shall be conducted in a scientific manner so that the results may be admissible as evidence in a judicial or administrative proceeding. 
Compliance data may be collected in either of two methods: 
1.  Self-monitoring by industrial users, with findings reported to the city. Self-monitoring requirements for industrial users are found in 40 CFR Part 403.12 and 40 CFR Part 136 as well as specific requirements as may be imposed by control documents (permit) issued by the city. The results of all such self-monitoring, as accomplished in accordance with 40 CFR Parts 403.12 and 136 shall be reported to the city at a frequency set by the director. 
2.  Inspections and direct sampling by the city. The city will conduct monitoring and sampling in accordance with subsection 98-150(c) and (d) and 40 CFR Parts 403 and 136 and any applicable State or local pretreatment standards. 
2.2  Compliance tracking. Once collected and assimilated, all compliance data must be systematically analyzed to identify violations. Data must be analyzed and managed with computer tracking system. This process must identify all violations, including those that do not involve a discharge, and must accurately determine whether a significant industrial user (SIU) is in compliance. All documentation submitted by a user may serve as evidence in judicial proceedings. All required documents must be signed by the authorized signatory and placed in the user's file with proof of receipt. Whether an industrial user is in significant non-compliance (SNC) status shall be determined based on the following criteria: 
  Subsections 98-152(e)(1)-(e)(8) of the city's Industrial Wastewater Ordinance; 
  Group II permitted non-significant industrial user criteria as listed in subsections 98-152(e)(3)-(e)(8) of the city's Industrial Wastewater Ordinance; 
  Group VI non-significant categorical industrial user criteria as listed in subsections 98-152(e)(3)-(e)(8) of the city's Industrial Wastewater Ordinance; and 
  All other industrial user criteria as listed in subsections 98-152(e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(8), of the city's Industrial Wastewater Ordinance. 
Division staff shall be assigned responsibility for initially screening all compliance data and identifying all pretreatment violations concerning SIUs. Information shall be reviewed for compliance with: 
1.  Program requirements; 
2.  Ordinance requirements; 
3.  Pretreatment requirements; and 
4.  Permit requirements. 
    Any NSCIU and NSIU facility that violates its permit shall be subject to enforcement action(s) as listed in the Enforcement Response Guide. In addition the director may, at his or her discretion, reclassify any NSCIU or NSIU to that of SIU at any time based on established departmental procedures. Compliance status shall be documented by use of standardized methods and procedures as developed by the director and the environmental division, and the control authority (City of Fort Worth per contract with Haltom City), unless the procedures and methods currently in use allow for comparability and are comprehensive. Documentation of compliance and pretreatment violations shall be kept on file in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.12(o). 
(Ord. No. O-2012-001-11, § 2(2-2.2), 1-30-12) 
Sec. 98-173. - Enforcement response. 
3.1  Responsible personnel. In enforcing the city's pretreatment program, the responsibilities of city personnel are outlined as follows: 
    Public works director (director) (PWD) -Is responsible for the city's wastewater operations, including employee safety, protection of collection system and protection of the POTW. In addition, the director is responsible for administering and implementing the Enforcement Response Plan and enforcement actions. The director receives recommendations from the ESC regarding termination of sewer and/or water service, approves termination of service and recommendations, and may pursue criminal, civil or administrative sanctions. 
    Environmental services coordinator (ESC) -Administers the City of Haltom City's Pretreatment Program. This position serves as the industry's primary contact in the city regarding program policy and requirements. Under contractual agreement, the ESC coordinates with the City of Fort Worth's Pretreatment Services Division to provide assistance in inspection, sampling, and preparation of required semi-annual reports. The ESC manages the pretreatment program, including but not limited to, designing sampling plan, record-keeping, sample collection, inspections, industrial surveys, and preparation and validation of the annual list of SIUs in SNC status. Responsibilities also include validating issuance of notice of violations, issuing citations, planning additional sampling developing and implementing city's pretreatment program to insure compliance with local, state and federal pretreatment regulations, recommending other enforcement actions, such as NOVs, administrative orders, and termination of sewer/water service. The ESC evaluates NOV responses and requests additional information and responses as needed. The ESC is also authorized to make telephone calls regarding violations and serve informal warnings. 
    City attorney- Advises technical and managerial personnel on enforcement matters and coordinates the criminal, civil or administrative response as deemed necessary by the public works director. The city attorney advises on matters requiring legal interpretation of TCEQ regulations, the Industrial Wastewater Ordinance and the enforcement response plan. In addition, the city attorney shall be contacted for assistance in drafting and/or reviewing legal documents for administrative orders, such as a notice of violation, a consent order, a show cause order, or a compliance order. 
3.2  Response criteria. When using the attached enforcement response guide to determine the appropriate enforcement action, the following criteria shall be considered: 
A.  Magnitude of the violation-Incidents of significant noncompliance shall result in the facility being published in the local newspaper [as required by 40 CFR Part 403.8(f)(2)(viii)]. In addition, the facility will be subject to appropriate enforcement response(s). 
B.  Duration of the violation-Enforcement response actions shall serve to prevent extended periods of noncompliance (regardless of severity) from recurring. 
C.  Effect of the violation on the receiving water, POTW process, and sludge disposal-Any such violation shall be dealt with severely, and occurs when an facility discharges a pollutant into the sanitary sewer system which: 
1.  Passes through the POTW (to a degree that the pass through meets the definition of pass through in the City's Industrial Wastewater Ordinance); 
2.  Inhibits or disrupts the POTW, its treatment processes or operations, or its sludge processes, use or disposal; 
3.  Causes a violation of the POTW's discharge permit, including violations of water quality standards, has a toxic effect on the receiving stream (i.e., fish kill.), or prevents sludge use or disposal. 
D.  Effect of the violation on the POTW-Incidents that result in significant increases in treatment costs or harm city personnel, equipment, processes, or operations (including sludge disposal costs) shall be subject to appropriate enforcement response(s). 
E.  Compliance history of the user-Recurring compliance problems (even of different program requirements) shall result in an escalation of enforcement to insure that consistent compliance is achieved. 
F.  Good faith of the user-A user's demonstrated willingness to comply shall be taken into account when the city is determining the appropriate enforcement response; however, good faith will not eliminate the necessity of an enforcement action. Good faith shall be defined as the user's honest intention to remedy its noncompliance in a timely fashion in conjunction with actions, which lend support to this intention. 
3.3  Response actions. Following the identification of a pretreatment violation, including the determination as to its significance in accordance with the Industrial Wastewater Ordinance, as revised, the most appropriate enforcement response will be selected and applied. This response must be proportionate to the violation severity, promote compliance in a timely manner, and be authorized under state law and the chapter 98, article IV, "industrial wastewater" of the City Code. 
The director is authorized to take the following enforcement response actions: 
A.  Issue a notice of deficiency. 
B.  Issue a notice of violation. 
C.  Schedule and informal meeting. 
D.  Issue administrative orders: 
1.  Consent order, 
2.  Show cause order, 
3.  Compliance Order, 
4.  Emergency suspension order, 
5.  Non-emergency termination order. 
E.  Initiate civil litigation, with approval of city manager: 
1.  Consent decree, 
2.  Injunction, 
3.  Civil penalty/cost recovery. 
F.  Issue general complaint citations. 
G.  Initiate criminal prosecution. 
H.  Terminate sewer and/or water service. 
I.  Issue supplemental enforcement actions (BMPs, EMS, P2). 
J.  Issue a public notice (SNC). 
K.  Increase monitoring and reporting. 
L.  Utilize the economic incentive matrix. 
    A brief description of each enforcement action is presented below, including a sample document where applicable. The sample documents in Appendix B are included for illustrative purposes, only. Should the director or the ESC need to issue an order, they should consult the city attorney with assistance in drafting or reviewing an administrative order or other legal document. In addition, the Enforcement Response Guidelines, found in Appendix A of this plan, clarify when each enforcement action should be used and identifies personnel authorized to issue an order or initiate an enforcement action. 
A.  Notice of deficiency. An informal communication from the city to the user which informs the user of a deficiency. If the information requested is not received within ten days, a notice of violation will be issued. 
B.  Notice of violation (NOV). An official communication from the city to the noncompliant user which informs the user that a pretreatment violation has occurred. Multipurpose use for non-significant violations, and for significant violations (generally in conjunction with additional actions.) Sample attached. Field notice is given for pH and temperature violations in the field. Formal violations are issued later. 
C.  Informal meeting with user. The city may require that the user attend a meeting to discuss any enforcement related issues. The city will work with the user as much as possible to schedule the meeting at a convenient time; however, it is ultimately the user's responsibility to attend any scheduled meeting. 
D.  Administrative orders. Enforcement documents which direct a user to undertake or to cease specified activities. The terms of the administrative order may or may not be negotiated with a user. Unless more severe action is justified, an administrative order is generally used as the first formal response to significant noncompliance and may incorporate compliance schedules, administrative penalties, and termination of service. The director may utilize one of four types of administrative orders. A sample of each type is attached. Administrative orders may require the evaluation of current treatment system and/or the installation of new technology to meet limits. Self-monitoring requirements and listed frequency are normally added to assure consistent compliance with pretreatment modifications. 
1.  Consent order. An agreement between the city and the user that normally includes: (1) compliance schedules; (2) stipulated fines or remedial actions; and (3) signatures of city and industry representatives. 
2.  Show cause order. An order that directs the user to appear before the city to explain its noncompliance, and show cause why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not be levied. Typically used after informal contacts or NOV's have failed to resolve noncompliance; however, it can be used at any time. 
3.  Compliance order. An order that directs the user to achieve or restore compliance by a date specified in the order. Terms need not be discussed with the industry in advance. Typically used when noncompliance cannot be resolved without construction, repair, or process changes, or to require development of management practices, spill prevention programs, and other pretreatment program requirements. 
4.  Emergency suspension order. An order that directs the noncompliant user to cease illegal or unauthorized discharges immediately, or to terminate the discharge altogether. Generally used in situations where the discharge could cause interference or pass through, or otherwise create an emergency situation. 
5.  Non-emergency termination order. An order that directs the noncompliant user to cease illegal or unauthorized discharges immediately, or to terminate the discharge altogether. Generally used as escalating enforcement action in a non-emergency situation. 
E.  Civil litigation. The formal process of filing lawsuits against a user to secure court ordered action to correct violations and to secure penalties for violations including the recovery of costs to the city for the noncompliance. Normally pursued when the corrective action required is costly and complex, or when the user is considered recalcitrant and unwilling to cooperate. The city will typically utilize three types of civil litigation: 
1.  Consent decree. Agreement between the city and the user reached after the lawsuit has been filed. Signed by the judge assigned to the case. 
2.  Injunction. Agreement between the city and the user reached after the lawsuit has been filed. Signed by the judge assigned to the case. 
3.  Civil penalties/cost recovery. Reimbursement to the city of all expenses incurred in responding to noncompliance, including restoration of the physical plant, payment of medical treatment of injured employees, and indemnification of the city for all fines assessed against it for discharge permit violations, which is generally higher than administrative fines. 
F.  General complaint citations. Citations may be issued under the city's police power and authority to enforce ordinances. The citations are criminal actions administered through the city's municipal court. 
G.  Criminal prosecution. The formal process of charging individuals and/or organization with violations of ordinance provisions that are punishable (upon conviction) by fines and/or imprisonment. The purpose of criminal prosecution is to punish noncompliance through court proceedings and to deter future noncompliance. 
H.  Termination of sewer and/or water service. The revocation of a user's privilege to discharge wastewater regulated by pretreatment services division into the city's sewer system. Termination may be accomplished by physical severance of the industry's connection to the sewer system, by use of an administrative order, or by a court ruling. This action will be considered to be an appropriate response to industries, which have not adequately responded to previous enforcement actions. This action requires prior notice to the user sufficient to avoid backflows, spills, or other harm to the treatment facility. A sample of such notice is attached. The city's Industrial Wastewater Ordinance also provide for the termination of water service, in addition to sewer service termination. 
I.  Supplemental enforcement actions. Best management practices (BMPs), environmental management system (EMS) implementation, pollution prevention programs (P2). When a user has demonstrated a history of noncompliance the city may at its discretion require the user to initiate best management practices, the development and implementation of an environmental management system and/or appropriate pollution prevention programs offered by agencies such as, but not limited to, EPA and TCEQ. 
J.  Public notice. In accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(viii), the city must annually publish a list of all users who significantly violated applicable pretreatment standard requirements during the pretreatment reporting year. Significant noncompliance shall be identified four times a year, in accordance with EPA guidelines, as shown in the "rolling quarters" method. 
K.  Increased monitoring and reporting. When a user has demonstrated a history of noncompliance the city may increase surveillance of that industry, including the requirement of additional self-monitoring and reporting. 
L.  Economic incentive matrix. The actions of a user which results in increased monitoring, reporting and administrative efforts due to noncompliance are considered part of an economic cost matrix utilized to offset the cost of the city's pretreatment program and provide an economic incentive for compliance. Additional fees are assessed for continued noncompliance and further enforcement actions. The fees are cumulative as the noncompliance continues. Each NOV, administrative order, and SNC are assessed separately. 
(Ord. No. O-2012-001-11, § 2(3-3.3), 1-30-12) 
Sec. 98-174. - Enforcement guidelines. 
    The city's enforcement response guidelines designates several alternative enforcement options for each type of violation. Once a violation is identified, an appropriate enforcement response action shall be selected from the short list of enforcement options listed in the matrix. 
    The following factors must be considered when selecting a response action from the options listed: 
  Magnitude of the violation. 
  Duration of the violation. 
  Violation's effect on the receiving waters, POTW process, and sludge disposal. 
  Violation's effect on the POTW treatment costs or harms city personnel, or equipment. 
  Compliance history of the user. 
  Good faith of the user. 
  Documented affirmative defense criteria as per City Code subsection 98-151(g). 
    After evaluating each of the above factors, the appropriate enforcement response action for the particular violation involved will be selected by authorized city personnel. 
    The attached guidelines: (1) identify violation type; (2) indicate appropriate initial and follow-up response; and (3) designate personnel responsible for administering each of these responses. The guidelines shall be used as follows: 
1.  Locate the type of noncompliance in the first column and identify the most accurate description of the violation. 
2.  Assess the appropriateness of the recommended response(s) in column two. First offenders or users demonstrating good faith efforts may merit a more lenient response. Similarly, repeat offenders or those demonstrating negligence may require a more stringent response. 
3.  Implement an enforcement action from column two to the user. Specify corrective action or other responses required of the user, if any. The range of responses in column two, are arranged in an escalating order. Column three indicates personnel responsible for administering each response, also in escalating order. 
4.  Follow-up with escalated enforcement action if the user's response is not received or violation continues. 
4.1  Enforcement escalation plan. The city's enforcement escalation plan is to be utilized to determine which enforcement action is timely and appropriate, and to apply consistency throughout our program. The escalation plan as incorporated into the enforcement response guide under the enforcement response and personnel headings, columns two and three, respectively act as a guideline for enforcement response after consideration of the enforcement response guide section listed above. Once the noncompliance and circumstances have been identified in columns one and two, the range of responses (in column two), is available to the enforcement agent(s). The personnel that can be involved in the enforcement action are listed in column three. 
    Generally, the responses range from a notice of violation to the termination of sewer and/or water service. If an industry fails to respond to the initial enforcement action (from column two), or the industry continues to remain in violation, then the next response would be enacted in an expeditious manner, per the response time frames outlined below. 
4.2  Time frames for responses. 
1.  Self-monitoring reports are normally due on the 15th day of the month following the month in which the sample was collected. All self-monitoring reports are reviewed upon receipt by the environmental services division environmental services coordinator and violations will be identified and documented within a reasonable time frame of approximately ten working days. Violations not related to self-monitoring will be identified and documented within a reasonable time frame of approximately ten working days of receiving compliance information. 
2.  Initial enforcement responses, involving contact with the user and requesting information on corrective or preventive action(s) will occur within 15 working days of violation detection. 
3.  Follow-up actions for continuing or recurring violations will be taken within 60 days of the initial enforcement response. For any continuing violations, the response will include a compliance schedule, if applicable. 
4.  Violations, which threaten health, property, or environmental quality are considered emergencies and will receive immediate responses such as halting the discharge or termination of service. 
5.  All violations meeting the criteria for significant noncompliance shall result in the facility being published in the local newspaper, as required by 40 CFR Part 403.8(f)(2)(viii). In addition, the city will take appropriate enforcement action(s) based on the criteria listed in this document. 
6.  Enforcement response guidelines as set forth in Appendix A.

Sec. 98-381. - Determination of system availability. 
(a)  When a developer plans to undertake a specific development project within the city or its extraterritorial jurisdiction and the development will require service through a public water and/or sanitary sewer system, it will be the responsibility of the developer to contact the city engineer to determine the system availability. The developer will advise the city engineer in writing of the specific location of his development, the total size of the development in acreage, living units and/or square feet of commercial or industrial space, the type of development and land use to occur within the subdivision, estimated amount of flows, if available; and the approximate time when public utilities will be required. The information may be incorporated into a preliminary plat or development plan application submitted to the director of community development. 
(b)  The city engineer shall review the city's current water and sanitary sewer system and determine whether service is currently available to the development. If service is available through an existing main, the city engineer shall identify the point on that main where the development will be permitted to tie into the system and will advise the developer in writing of the location where a tie-in will be permitted. The city engineer shall support such written notice with such map exhibits as are necessary to clearly delineate the point of tie-in. 
(c)  In the event that a connection to an existing utility main is possible, the city engineer will determine if the utility main has been installed by the city or whether it was installed by a prior developer under the approach main extension policies of this article. In the event that the utility main was installed by the city and the city is not entitled to pro rata reimbursement under the terms of sections 98-380 and 98-384, the developer will be advised that there will be no pro rata reimbursement charge to tie into the utility main. The developer will be responsible for the entire cost of the approach main or service line connecting his development to the utility main. In the event that the city is due pro rata, the developer shall pay the pro rata charge into the pro rata escrow account of the city, prior to making a tie-in to the system. 
(d)  If the utility main or a portion of the utility system serving the development was installed by a prior developer under the approach main extension policy outlined in this article, the city engineer will advise the developer of his pro rata share of costs for connection to this line. The developer shall pay a pro rata charge into the pro rata escrow account of the city prior to making a tie-in to the system. 
(Ord. No. O-98-004-11, § 1(21-175), 1-26-98) 
Sec. 98-382. - Construction of approach mains. 
    If the city engineer should determine that utility service to a proposed development is not available at the present time, the developer will be so advised in writing. In this situation, the developer must select among the following alternatives: 
(1)  Discontinue his proposed development until such time as a utility system has been installed within the drainage basin or service area; 
(2)  Petition the city council to expedite the construction of a utility system capable of serving the proposed development; or 
(3)  Install the necessary utilities to the point necessary to serve the development. The developer will be responsible for all costs associated with the installation of necessary utilities, including but not limited to engineering, attorneys' fees, surveying, testing, easement preparation, easement acquisition, construction and inspection. The public utilities will be designed and constructed to city standards and specifications as the city engineer determines to be applicable. The developer may install the public utilities himself or may contract with the city to secure construction of the utilities by the city. All financial arrangements, including any necessary bonding, shall be completed prior to the execution of a developer agreement. In the event that a developer elects to pursue this alternative, he will be eligible to receive a pro rata reimbursement, for a period of ten years from the execution of the pro rata agreement, from future developers who tie into these specific utilities.

Sec. 98-384. - Pro rata cost allocation where public utilities are financed by initial developer. 
(a)  If a public utility system is installed within a drainage basin or service area by a developer, each subsequent development within the drainage basin or service area which ties into the public utility system shall pay a pro rata share of the cost of the utility system installed by the initial developer. The pro rata fee shall be paid prior to connection to the utility system. The pro rata fee for each subsequent development seeking service shall be determined on a cost per acre basis by calculating the proportional area of the new development to the total area within the drainage basin or service area served by the public utility system, multiplied by the total cost of the public utility system installed by the initial developer. Total cost of the utilities shall include construction, engineering, attorneys fees, surveying, testing, easement preparation, easement acquisition, and inspection costs. 
(b)  Each initial developer shall be entitled to a rebate of the pro rata charge against subsequent developers for a period of ten years following completion and acceptance of the utilities. At the expiration of the tenth year, the developer will no longer be entitled to receive any reimbursement.

Sec. 98-385. - Management of escrow account. 
(a)  The city shall establish an escrow account in the water/sewer fund for the deposit of all pro rata payments made by subsequent developers. A separate escrow account shall be established for each public utility system constructed by an initial developer. All pro rata fees received from subsequent developments or subdivisions in that drainage basin or service area shall be deposited into that specific escrow account. 
(b)  A minimum of twice each year, on January 30 and on July 31, the director of finance shall inventory each escrow account to determine what percentage of those monies is allocable to reimbursable oversizing costs owed by the city as determined under section 98-386. This allocation shall be determined in the same proportion that the cost of the oversized line bears to the cost of the line size that is necessary to serve the development. For other utility system improvements, the allocation shall be determined in the same proportion that the cost of the oversized improvements bear to the cost of the minimum improvements required by city ordinances to serve the development, as determined by the city engineer. Upon completion of such inventory, the director of finance shall transmit all escrow funds due and owing to the initial developer. Upon payment of these funds, the city will receive a credit for the amount of money allocable toward its reimbursable oversizing requirements as set forth in section 98-386. 
(c)  The developer shall be responsible for providing to the city, and maintaining with the city, an accurate current address. When escrowed funds are available for disbursement, the city shall notify the developer at the address on file with the city. If the developer fails to withdraw the funds within six months, the funds shall be forfeited to the city's water and sewer fund. 
(d)  At no time shall the developer be entitled to receive reimbursement for a sum greater than the initial cost of the public utilities less the pro rata share of capacity of that utility system that would have been attributable to the initial development for its proportionate share of capacity in the system. 
(Ord. No. O-98-004-11, § 1(21-179), 1-26-98) 
Sec. 98-386. - Oversizing. 
    In order to provide appropriate capacity for reasonably anticipated development in a drainage basin or service area, the city engineer, with the approval of the city council, may require a developer to install a utility line or system improvement larger than necessary to support the developer's specific development. In the event that the city engineer, with approval of the city council, requires the installation of a utility line or system improvements larger than required to serve the development, the developer installing the line will be reimbursed by the city for the difference in cost between the size of the line or system improvement required by the city engineer and the line size or system improvement required to serve the development. The size of the facilities required to serve the development shall be determined by the city engineer. The city may compensate the developer for the difference in cost mandated by oversizing through the process of allowing the developer credits of up to 50 percent of all development fees charged against any portion or phase of the development. Upon written request of the developer, credit for development fees may be transferred from the current development project to subsequent development projects, subdivisions or phases undertaken by the developer.

Sec. 98-505. - Establishment of water and sanitary sewer service area. 
    The water and sanitary sewer service area shall be the corporate limits of the city. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-011-16, § 1, 3-26-02) 
Sec. 98-506. - Land use assumptions. 
    Land use assumptions used in the development of impact fees are hereby adopted as shown in exhibit "B" to this article. These assumptions may be revised by the city council according to the procedure set forth in Chapter 395. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-011-16, § 1, 3-26-02) 
Sec. 98-507. - Capital improvement plans. 
    The capital improvement plans for the city are hereby adopted as two separate components: A sanitary sewer capital improvement plan and a water capital improvement plan. The capital improvement plans are set forth in exhibit "B" to this article. The capital improvement plans may be amended from time to time, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Chapter 395. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-011-16, § 1, 3-26-02) 
Sec. 98-508. - Service units. 
(a)  Service units are established in accordance with generally accepted engineering and planning standards. 
(b)  The water and sanitary sewer impact fees per service unit shall be calculated based on standard water meter sizes as set forth in exhibit "A", or alternatively, as approved by the city manager, based on the recommendation of the city engineer as a result of an engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering services in the State of Texas, which demonstrates that the number of service units for the category of service of the new development will be different than the standard service unit. 
(c)  No impact fee shall be assessed or collected for a fire flow connection. However, if routine water service that is not related to fire protection is detected at a fire flow connection, the applicable impact fee will be assessed and based on the typical size of meter required to provide service for the residential, commercial or industrial property. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-011-16, § 1, 3-26-02) 
Sec. 98-509. - Impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  The assessed impact fee per service unit is computed by subtracting 50 percent of the total projected cost of implementing the capital improvement plans from the growth-related capital construction cost in the capital improvement plans for that category of capital improvements, and dividing that amount by the total number of projected service units anticipated within the service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development, based on the land use assumptions for that service area. The assessed impact fees per service unit established by category of capital improvements are set forth in exhibit "C" to this article. 
(b)  The assessed impact fees in exhibit "C" may be amended by the city council according to the procedures set forth in Chapter 395.

Sec. 98-510. - Assessment of impact fees. 
(a)  The approval of any subdivision of land for any new development shall include as a condition the assessment of the impact fees applicable to such development. 
(b)  Assessment of the impact fees for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For a new development which was final platted pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations prior to the adoption of Ordinance No. 1482 on June 18, 1990, assessment shall be the maximum impact fee adopted in Ordinance No. 1482. 
(2)  For a new development which was final platted pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations following the adoption of Ordinance No. 1482 on June 18, 1990, assessment shall be the maximum impact fee in effect at the time of final plat recordation. 
(c)  Because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole, water demand related solely to fire protection is not subject to assessment of an impact fee. However, if the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for regular residential, commercial or industrial purposes as evidenced by the record of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the then current impact fee should be assessed and collected from the current owner of the property for routine usage as domestic capacity. 
(d)  Following assessment of the impact fees pursuant to subsection (b) herein, no additional impact fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases or the property is replatted. 
(e)  In addition to the impact fees assessed in exhibit "C", the applicable Fort Worth access fee for water and sanitary sewer service shall be assessed as shown in exhibit "D" attached hereto. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-011-16, § 1, 3-26-02) 
Sec. 98-511. - Calculation of impact fees. 
(a)  Following a request for a building permit or tap purchase for new development, the city manager shall compute impact fees due for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The number of service units shall be determined by the category of service or as otherwise determined by the city manager as provided in subsection 98-508(b); 
(2)  The total service units shall be multiplied by the appropriate per-unit fee amount determined as set forth in section 98-509. 
(3)  The Fort Worth access fee shall be added to determine the total impact fee due. 
(b)  The total amount of each impact fee due for a new development shall not exceed the amounts shown in exhibit "D". 
(c)  Separate impact fees shall be calculated for water and sanitary sewer service. 
(d)  When a water service or sanitary sewer service is sized up to meet the demand of new development, the collected impact fee shall be the difference between the assessed fee for the new, larger sized water meter and the assessed fee for the size of the existing meter. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-011-16, § 1, 3-26-02) 
Sec. 98-512. - Collection of impact fees. 
(a)  No building permit shall be issued or water or sanitary sewer tap allowed until all impact fees have been paid to the city except as provided otherwise by contract. 
(b)  Impact fees shall be collected at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
(c)  On property that was platted after the effective date of this article, impact fees shall be collected as follows: 
(1)  On any service unit for which a valid building permit is issued within one year of the adoption of this article, the collection rate shall be 70 percent of the assessed impact fee; 
(2)  On any service unit for which a valid building permit is issued between one and two years of the adoption of this article, the collection rate shall be 80 percent of the assessed impact fee; 
(3)  On any service unit for which a valid building permit is issued after two years from the adoption of this article, the collection rate shall be 100 percent of the assessed impact fee. 
(d)  The amounts to be collected under the above collection rates are set forth in exhibit "E" attached hereto. The amount of impact fees collected on any service unit shall not exceed the maximum impact fee assessed on that service unit. 
(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, the city may enter into an contract with the owner of a tract of land for which a plat has been recorded providing for a different time and method of payment of the impact fees. 
(Ord. No. O-2002-011-16, § 1, 3-26-02) 
Sec. 98-513. - Establishment of accounts and records. 
(a)  The city manager shall establish separate interest-bearing accounts for water and sanitary sewer impact fees. 
(b)  Interest earned by each account shall be credited to that account and shall be used solely for the purposes specified for funds authorized in section 98-514. 
(c)  The city manager shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to ensure that impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the purposes authorized in this article. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city manager at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this article; provided, however, that any fee paid shall be expended within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed ten years from the date the fee is deposited into the account.

(Ord. No. O-2004-015-11, § II, 10-11-04) 
Sec. 98-543. - Calculation of stormwater utility fees. 
    Stormwater utility fees are monthly fees charged for the stormwater runoff potential on each parcel within the city based on the schedules of rates and charges as may from time to time be levied by the city council. 
(1)  Fee calculation. The stormwater utility fee shall be based on an inventory of parcels within the City of Haltom City which also evaluates the stormwater runoff potential on those parcels and establishes a rate for each rate class. The stormwater utility fee shall be set to recover the cost-of-service that has been established for the stormwater utility system in a fair and equitable manner. The runoff coefficient and total parcel area for parcels in each class shall be used to establish the stormwater runoff potential for the class relative to other classes within the city. The proportional stormwater runoff potential for each class shall be distributed equitably between classes and among the parcels in each class. 
(2)  Stormwater runoff potential. The total area for parcels shall be inventoried from parcel information established by Tarrant County Appraisal District, from Geographic Information System records and from aerial photography available for properties within the city. For purposes of establishing the stormwater runoff potential on parcels between and within each rate class, the runoff coefficient that is set forth in the city's engineering design standards for development, Ordinance No. O-95-020-15, shall be multiplied by the parcel area to calculate the stormwater runoff potential for the parcel. Runoff coefficients and corresponding runoff potential for various land uses may be modified by the city council from time to time by modification of the engineering design standards for development. 
(3)  Rates in accordance with act. The city council hereby finds and determines that the methodology for determining the stormwater utility fee has been established in accordance with the provisions of the act, including, but not limited to, Section 402.047. 
(4)  Credit availability. Any non-residential property or multi-family residential property that is directly served by an approved and privately owned stormwater system or facility may apply for a credit to the stormwater utility fee. The director may adjust the stormwater utility fee for such properties according to the actual mitigative effect of the private facility on the city's annual maintenance and operation costs, provided that: 
a.  The owner remains responsible for all costs of maintenance of the facility; 
b.  The facility was constructed and is maintained in compliance with the city's stormwater standards and specifications; 
c.  The owner obtained the proper permits from the city. 
(5)  Credits. Those improved non-residential properties and multi-family residential properties on which stormwater runoff management techniques are used are eligible to receive a credit on their monthly billings, provided that: 
a.  The application for such credit shall follow the procedures as set forth in this ordinance; 
b.  The application for credit shall be in writing and shall include an engineering report prepared by a Texas licensed professional engineer presenting the rationale for determining the credit for the approved stormwater management techniques; 
c.  The credit methodology shall be an administrative policy as established by written report maintained in the public works department of the city; 
d.  The credit will be only for the impervious area within the total parcel area which receives the stormwater management technique; 
e.  The maximum credits that are available with appropriate documentation and review and approval by the director are as follows: 
1.  The area which receives approved street sweeping on a weekly basis will be eligible for up to a five percent reduction in the fee. 
2.  The area which drains into an approved detention basin will be eligible for up to a 15 percent reduction in the fee. 
3.  The area which drains into an approved retention basin will be eligible for up to a 35 percent reduction in the fee. 
f.  Any property served by a private facility which is maintained by the city shall not receive a credit and shall be charged the normal monthly stormwater utility fee. 
g.  The director shall have the right to inspect the private stormwater infrastructure facility at any reasonable time to determine if it is in compliance with the approved design and continues to be capable of functioning properly. If the facility's performance is affected, because it fails to meet the proper operating standards, has been altered, or is in disrepair, the property owner shall pay the monthly stormwater utility fee at the normal rate, without benefit of reduction, until such time that the facility is brought into total compliance. 
(6)  Late charges. A ten percent late charge will be applied to all accounts that remain unpaid 15 days after the billing date. The purpose of this charge is to cover the excess billing, accounting, collection and administrative costs of the city which result from the failure of customers to make timely payments. 
(7)  Partial payment. Any partial payment of the stormwater utility fee will be applied against the amount due in accordance with the policies established by the utility billing policies and procedures. 
(8)  Non-payment. Any charge due hereunder which is not paid when due may be recovered in an action at law by the city. In accordance with Chapter 402.050 and in addition to any other remedies or penalties provided at law or in this section, failure of a user of the stormwater utility system to pay the charges promptly when due shall subject such user to several actions, including discontinuance of any utility services provided by the city and placement of a lien against the property.

(2)  An appeal to the city council must be filed by the applicant with the city secretary within 30 days following the director's decision. The city council shall hear the appeal within 60 days of receipt of the appeal by the city secretary. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the applicant at least 14 days prior to the hearing. 
(3)  The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that the fee is not applicable or that the determination of the value of the fee or of the offset or credit was not calculated according to the applicable stormwater fee schedule or the guidelines established in this article. The applicant shall submit to the city council at the time of filing the appeal an engineering report prepared by a Texas licensed professional engineer, which demonstrates that the applicant's burden has been met. 
(4)  If the appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient security satisfactory to the city attorney in an amount equal to the original determination of the drainage fee due, any discontinued utility services may be reinstated while the appeal is pending. 
(5)  At the hearing, the city council shall allow testimony from the applicant, city personnel and other interested persons relevant to the appeal. The hearing may be continued from time to time. 
(6)  Following the hearing, the city council shall consider all evidence and determine whether the appeal should be granted (in whole or in part) or denied. 
(7)  The city council shall complete its review and make a decision about the appeal within 90 days of the hearing. The city council shall apply the standards and review criteria contained in this section. 
(8)  The city council's decision shall be final. 
(c)  Appeal of lien. Before imposing a lien for delinquent stormwater charges, city shall send notice, to the owner of record of the benefitted property, of the amount of the charges owed and any penalties or interest accrued, and of the owner's right to appeal the placement of the lien. Within ten working days of the postmark of the notice sent to the property owner, the owner may appeal the decision to impose the lien on the property to the director. Within five working days of receiving the notice of appeal, the director shall direct that the lien not be filed if the owner shows that no bill for the above mentioned services encumbered by the lien or liens is owned by the customer of the stormwater utility, who may not be the owner of the property, or by the owner, and shall give the owner written notice of the director's decision. The lien is security for the accrued stormwater fees and interest accruing at ten percent per annum from the date that the fee was due. The director may modify the lien to reflect the true amount of delinquency in payment for services to the property if the owner demonstrates that a lesser bill is owned. When a person pays all principal, interest and charges of a valid lien filed pursuant to this ordinance, the director shall execute a release of that lien and surrender it to the paying party. The paying party shall be responsible for the filing of that release.

(Ord. No. O-2009-025-11, § 1, 11-16-09) 
Sec. 98-585. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Warning Notice. When the City Engineer finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, or any order issued hereunder, the City Engineer may serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to a warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of a warning notice. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the City to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a warning notice. 
(b)  Notification of Violation. When the City Engineer finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, or any order issued hereunder, the City Engineer may serve upon that person a written Notice of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of reoccurrence thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the alleged violator to the City Engineer. If the alleged violator denies that any violation occurred and/or contends that no corrective action is necessary, an explanation of the basis of any such denial or contention shall be submitted to the City Engineer within ten (10) days of receipt of the notice. Submission of an explanation and/or plan in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the City to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. 
(c)  Consent Orders. The City may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance with any provision in this Article or any order issued hereunder. Such documents may include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Subsections (e)-(g) of this Section and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(d)  Show Cause Hearing. The City Engineer may order any person who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, or any order issued hereunder, to appear before the City Engineer and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the alleged violator specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the alleged violator show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the alleged violator. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the rights and procedures specified in Section 98-586(a)(7). Notice of the decision of the City Engineer from the hearing shall be served on the petitioning party personally or by registered or certified mail. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against or prerequisite for taking any other action against the alleged violator. 
(e)  Compliance Orders. When the City Engineer finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, or any order issued hereunder, the City Engineer may issue an order to the violator directing that the violator come into compliance within a specified time limit. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the MS4 and waters of the United States. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established by a state or federal standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
(f)  Remediation: Abatement, and Restoration Orders. When the City Engineer finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, or any order issued hereunder, and that such violation has adversely affected the MS4 or the waters of the United States, the City Engineer may issue an order to the violator directing him/her to undertake and implement any appropriate action to remediate and/or abate any adverse effects of the violation upon the MS4 or the waters of the United States, and/or to restore any part of the MS4 or the waters of the United States. Such remedial, abatement, and restoration action may include, but not be limited to: monitoring, assessment, evaluation of the adverse effects, determination of the appropriate remedial, abatement, and restoration action; confinement, removal, cleanup, treatment, and disposal of any discharged or released pollution or contamination; prevention, minimization, and/or mitigation of any damage to the public health, welfare, or the environment that may result from the violation; restoration or replacement of City property or natural resources damaged by the violation. The order may direct that the remediation, abatement, and/or restoration be accomplished on a specified compliance schedule and/or be completed within a specified period of time. An order issued under this Subsection does not relieve the violator of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of an order under this Subsection shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against any responsible party. 
(g)  Emergency Cease and Desist Orders. When the City Engineer finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) have caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the City Engineer may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements of this Article; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this Subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. 
In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the City Engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The City Engineer may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this Article. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the City Engineer within ten days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator. 
The city shall not reinstate suspended services, that have been terminated in accordance with this Section, to the violator until: 
a.  The violator presents proof, satisfactory to the City Engineer, that the noncompliant discharge has been eliminated and its cause determined and corrected; 
b.  The violator pays the City for all costs the City incurred in responding to abating, and remediating the discharge or threatened discharge; and 
c.  The violator pays the City for all costs the City will incur in reinstating service or access. 
(h)  Red Tags. Whenever the City Engineer finds that any operator of a construction site has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, or any order issued thereunder, the City Engineer may order that a "Red Tag" be issued to the operator, posted at the construction site, and distributed to all City departments and divisions whose decisions affect any activity at the site. Unless express written exception is made by the City Engineer, the "Red Tag" shall prohibit any further construction activity at the site and shall bar any further inspection or approval by the City associated with a building permit, grading permit, subdivision plat approval, site development plan approval, or any other City approval necessary to commence or continue construction or to assume occupancy at the site. Issuance of a "Red Tag" order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.

Editor's note- Ord. No. O-2002-032-15, adopted Sept. 9, 2002, repealed the former zoning ordinance of the city and enacted a new ordinance as set out herein. The former App. B derived from Ord.

Sec. 1. - Interpretation, purposes, and administration. 
A.  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare. The zoning regulations and districts as herein established, have been made in accordance with a comprehensive plan, for the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals and the general welfare of the City of Haltom City. This ordinance has been designed, among other things, to lessen congestion in the streets, to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers, to provide adequate light and pure air; to avoid undue concentration of population, and to facilitate adequate provisions for transportation, water, sewage, schools, parking areas and other public requirements. In addition, it is not the intent of this ordinance to interfere with or infringe upon the fundamental right of a parent or guardian to raise and educate their children. 
B.  The zoning administrator is charged with the administration and interpretation of this ordinance. In the event that this ordinance or any provision hereof is unclear as to its applicability to any property or person, the zoning administrator shall render an interpretation of such ordinance or provision after taking into consideration the purpose and intent of the ordinance as a whole. 
The decision of the zoning administrator shall be subject to approval of the board of adjustment as provided in section 35, board of adjustment. 
Sec. 2. - Purpose and scope. 
    It is hereby declared to be the purpose and intent of the city council by enacting this ordinance that the zoning regulations and districts, as herein established, have been made in accordance with a comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the city. They have been designed to lessen the congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of the land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, open spaces, and to protect and enhance historical, cultural and environmental qualities, and other public requirements. They have been made with reasonable consideration, among other things; of the right to use the land subject to reasonable regulations; of the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for the particular uses specified; and with a view of conserving the value of land and buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the city consistent with the comprehensive plan as required by law. 
    The provisions of this zoning ordinance constitute minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, morals and general welfare of the City of Haltom City, Texas. Wherever higher or more restrictive standards are established by provisions of any other applicable statute, ordinance or regulation than is established by the provisions of this ordinance, the provisions of such other statute, ordinance or regulation shall govern. 
Sec. 3. - Preserving rights. 
A.  Non-conforming uses or structures. Any use or structure that existed as a non-conforming or previously conforming use or structure under Ordinance 97-015-15 prior to adoption of this ordinance shall be permitted to continue as a non-conforming use or structure, subject to the provisions of section 34, "non-conforming uses, lots and structures", unless such use or structure is made a conforming use or structure under this ordinance. 
B.  Exemptions to non-conforming regulations. Any use that does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance that require the use to have a conditional use permit, but which existed as a conforming use without a conditional use permit under Ordinance No. 97-015-15 prior to the adoption of this ordinance, shall be permitted to continue as a non-conforming use and shall not be subject to the provisions of section 34, non-conforming uses, lots and structures, of this ordinance. In the event such a use is replaced by or changed to a use conforming to the provisions of this ordinance, the nonconforming use shall be considered void and only uses conforming to this ordinance will be permitted thereafter. The burden of proof that the exemption provided by this section exists shall rest on the property owner. 
C.  Illegal use or structures. By adoption of this ordinance, no presently illegal use or structure shall be deemed to have been legalized unless such use or structure falls within a district where the actual use and structure conform to the provisions of this ordinance. 
Sec. 4. - Zoning districts. 
A.  Purpose. In order to regulate and restrict the location of trades and industries and the location of buildings erected, reconstructed, altered or enlarged for specified uses, to regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected, reconstructed, altered or enlarged, to regulate and determine the area of yards and other open spaces and to regulate and limit the density of population, the city is hereby divided into 17 zoning districts to be known as follows: 
"SF-1" Single family residential district, or district "SF-1" "SF-2" Single family district, or district "SF-2" "D" Duplex residential district, or district "D" "TH" Townhouse residential district, or district "TH" "MF-1" Multiple family residential district, or district "MF-1" "MF-2" Multiple family residential district, or district "MF-2" "MH" Manufactured housing district, or district "MH" "O" Office district, or district "O" "C-1" Commercial district, or district "C-1" "C-2" Commercial district, or district "C-2" "C-3" Commercial district, or district "C-3" "C-4" Commercial district, or district "C-4" "C-5" Commercial district, or district "C-5" "M-1" Industrial district, or district "M-1" "M-2" Heavy industrial district, or district "M-2" "BP" Business park district, or district "BP" "PD" Planned development district, or district "PD"  
Sec. 5. - Zoning district map. 
    The districts aforesaid, and the boundaries of such districts, shall be as hereinafter described, and as shown upon the map attached hereto and made a part of this ordinance, said map being designated as the "Zoning Map of the City of Haltom City, Texas". The map and all notations, references, and other information shown thereon shall be a part of this ordinance the same as if all such matters and information were fully described herein. The original of said map shall bear the date of the passing of this ordinance and shall be signed by the mayor and attested by the city secretary, under the seal of the city. The original map shall be kept in the office of the city secretary in the city hall, and a replica thereof shall be produced upon paper in such reduced scale as will permit it being attached to this ordinance. 
    It shall be the duty of the city manager or his designee to keep the official zoning map and current copies up to date, by entering on such map any changes which the city council may from time to time approve by amendments to the zoning ordinance. 
Sec. 6. - Zoning district boundaries. 
A.  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts, as shown on the map accompanying and made a part of this ordinance, the following rules shall apply: 
1.  The district boundaries are either streets, alleys, or railroad right-of-way unless otherwise shown, and where the districts designated on the map accompanying and made a part of this ordinance are bounded approximately by street or alley lines, said street or alley shall be construed to be the boundary of such district. Where the districts designated on the map accompanying and made a part of this ordinance are bounded approximately by railroad right-of-way lines, public rights-of-way, or the center line of the railroad right-of-way, said right-of-way or center line shall be construed to be the boundary of the district. 
2.  Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated and where the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the district boundaries shall be construed to be lot lines, and where the districts designated on the map accompanying and made a part of this ordinance are bounded approximately by lot lines, said lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of such districts unless said boundaries are otherwise indicated on the map. 
3.  In un-subdivided property, the district boundary lines on the map accompanying and made a part of this ordinance shall be determined by use of the scale contained on such map, unless dimensions are shown. 
4.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the city limits shall be construed as following the city limits. 
5.  Boundaries indicated as following the centerlines of streams or rivers or the shoreline of lakes or ponds shall be construed as following such centerlines or shorelines as the case may be. 
6.  Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated by official action of the city council, or whenever such area is franchised for building purposes; the zoning district line adjoining each side of such street, alley, or other public way shall be automatically extended to the centerline of such vacated street, alley or way and all area so involved shall then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended districts. 
Sec. 7. - Newly annexed territory. 
    In the event that any territory is subsequently disannexed from surrounding communities and annexed into the city, the annexed territory shall be temporarily classified in the "SF-1" single family residential district until permanent zoning classifications are given to the area by the city council of the City of Haltom City, Texas. The procedure for establishing appropriate zoning on any annexed territory shall be the same as set forth in section 39, changes and amendments, for the amendment of the zoning ordinance. 
Sec. 8. - Consistency with comprehensive plan. 
    As the zoning ordinance is one implementation tool for the city's comprehensive plan, the zoning ordinance shall be kept current and consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. Consequently, it shall be the policy of the city council that during the review of the comprehensive plan the appropriate implementation committee shall review the zoning on all undeveloped parcels of land to determine if the zoning in effect at the time is appropriate. If there are undeveloped parcels with zoning which has been in effect for at least ten years and if, in the committee's opinion, zoning is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan and no longer appropriate, a recommendation shall be made that a public hearing be called to review said zoning. Proceedings may then be initiated to amend the ordinance as specified in section 39, changes and amendments. 
Sec. 9. - Use matrix. 
A.  Uses permitted by district. Land and buildings in each of the zoning districts may be used for any of the indicated uses but no land shall hereafter be used, and no building or structure shall hereafter be erected, altered, or converted, which is arranged or designed or used for other than those uses specified as permitted uses in the district in which it is located, according to the use matrix and the provisions of the following sections of this ordinance.

1.  The zoning administrator shall refer the question concerning any new or unlisted use to the planning and zoning commission requesting an interpretation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. The referral of the use interpretation question shall be accompanied by a statement of facts listing the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity, sales, processing, type of product, storage, and amount and nature thereof, enclosed or open storage, anticipated employment, transportation requirements, the amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material and vibration likely to be generated, and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer. 
2.  The planning and zoning commission shall consider the nature and described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses permitted in the various districts, and determine the zoning district or districts within which such use should be permitted. 
3.  The planning and zoning commission shall transmit its findings and recommendations to the city council as to the classification proposed for any new or unlisted use. The city council may, by ordinance, approve the recommendation of the commission or make such determination concerning the classification of such use as is determined appropriate.

AA.  Community home. It is the purpose and intent of this subsection to regulate community homes so as to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of a community home, the citizens of the City, and visitors thereto, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations that allow community homes to locate in specific neighborhoods. Residents of community homes are intended to benefit from being situated within the neighborhood rather than an area of more intense uses. These regulations are intended to balance the right of the citizens of the City to live in a safe and peaceful environment and, on the other hand, the right of individuals to live freely in accordance with the guidelines of the laws and Constitution of the United States and United States Supreme Court rulings pursuant thereto. 
These regulations are intended to fully comply with the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 ("FHAA"), as amended, and all other applicable state and federal legislation, which may require that reasonable accommodations be made in rules, policies, and practices to permit persons with handicaps or disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. 
These regulations are also intended to deter property uses and activities which directly or indirectly cause adverse secondary effects, including the depreciation of property values, in the immediate neighborhood surrounding the community home. It is not the purpose or intent of these regulations to restrict or deny lawful access by individuals to housing, but rather to designate a safe and reasonable location to facilitate the operation of a successful community home in a single family neighborhood.

4.  Orderly facilitation of purposeful housing standard. A community home may not be established within one-half mile of an existing community home. The intent of this paragraph is to prevent oversaturation of community homes, which may be detrimental to the community home residents' ability to benefit from living within a neighborhood, rather than an area of more intense uses. 
5.  Limitation on number of motor vehicles. Except as otherwise provided in the Haltom City Zoning Ordinance, the residents of a community home may not keep for the use of the residents of the home, either on the premises of the home or on a public right-of-way adjacent to the home, motor vehicles in numbers that exceed the number of bedrooms in the home.

a.  the facility is established or operating in violation of Texas Health and Safety Code Section 247.021; and 
b.  the continued operation of the facility creates an immediate threat to the health and safety of a resident of the facility. 
The emergency order to close the facility may be appealed, in whole or in part, to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 35. 
11.  Reasonable Accommodation. The provisions in this subsection governing the use of community homes shall not be construed to limit a person's right to request a reasonable accommodation on the basis of a disability. A person requesting a reasonable accommodation from this ordinance on the basis of a disability may file a request for reasonable accommodation with the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 35. 
BB.  Banquet Hall. Banquet halls as a primary use must:

Sec. 34. - Non-conforming uses, lots and structures. 
A.  Purpose and intent. Within the districts established by this ordinance, there may exist buildings or uses of land and buildings which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments. Such non-conforming buildings or uses of land and buildings may be continued although they do not conform with the provisions of this ordinance, subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this section. Such non-conforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. 
With due regard for the property rights of the persons affected when considered in light of the public welfare, the character of the area surrounding the non-conforming use and the conservation and preservation of surrounding properties and their values, it is the declared purpose of this ordinance that non-conforming uses be eliminated and be required to conform to the regulations prescribed in this ordinance. 
B.  Building on non-conforming lots of record. In any district, buildings may be erected on any single lot of record, provided there is access to such buildings from a street and the lot is in the same ownership as recorded on the effective date of this ordinance. This provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet the minimum requirements for area, width, or depth for the district in which it is located; however, all other requirements shall still apply. All buildings constructed on non-conforming lots of record shall meet all development regulations in the district unless proper variances are granted by the board of adjustment. No building shall be constructed on multiple lots. Whenever construction is desired on multiple lots, the property owner shall replat the property into a single lot. 
C.  Non-conforming buildings. Repairs and alterations may be made to a non-conforming building, provided that no structural alterations shall be made except those required by law or ordinance, unless the building is brought into conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
D.  Non-conforming use of buildings. A non-conforming use of a building shall not be increased or enlarged and no occupancy of additional buildings or land by a non-conforming use shall be permitted except that a non-conforming use of a building may be extended throughout any parts of the building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use and which were owned or leased by the owner of the non-conforming use on the effective date of this ordinance, provided no structural alterations, except those required by law or ordinance, are made, and provided further that no additional dwelling units shall be added where the non-conforming use results from there being more dwelling units on the lot than is permissible in the district in which the building is located. The board of adjustment shall have the authority to permit an extension of a building which is non-conforming as to uses not to exceed 25 percent of the existing floor area, subject to the development regulations applicable in the zoning district. 
E.  Non-conforming use of land. Unless otherwise provided in this section, a non-conforming use of land may not be expanded or extended beyond the area of land actually being occupied by the use at the time it becomes non-conforming, except to provide off street loading or off street parking space facilities. Notwithstanding the above, the board of adjustment may permit an expansion of a non-conforming use of land on a lot of record not to exceed 25 percent of the existing area of the land actually being occupied by the non-conforming use, subject to the development regulations applicable to the zoning district. 
F.  Discontinuance or abandonment. 
1.  Defined. A non-conforming use, when discontinued or abandoned, shall not be resumed and any further use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. Discontinuance or abandonment shall be defined as follows: 
a.  When land used for a non-conforming use shall cease to be used in a bona fide manner for the non-conforming use for six consecutive calendar months. 
b.  When a building designed or arranged for a non-conforming use shall cease to be used in a bona fide manner as a non-conforming use for a period of six consecutive calendar months. 
c.  When a building designed or arranged for a conforming use shall cease to be used in a bona fide manner as a non-conforming use for a period of six consecutive calendar months. 
d.  When land or a building used only on a seasonal basis is not used in a bona fide manner as a non-conforming use during such season. 
2.  Presumption. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the property owner intended to discontinue or abandon the non-conforming use if such use ceases for the above time periods. 
3.  Deemed to have occurred. Discontinuance or abandonment shall be conclusively deemed to have occurred irrespective of the intent of the property owner if the non-conforming use was dilapidated, substandard, or was not maintained in a suitable condition for occupancy during the above time periods. 
4.  Hardship. Upon evidence of hardship, the board of adjustment shall have the power to extend the time limits in subsection F.1., not to exceed one year. 
G.  Destruction of non-conforming use. 
1.  Destruction. If a non-conforming building or a building occupied by a non-conforming use is destroyed by fire, the elements, or otherwise, it may not be reconstructed or rebuilt except to conform with the provisions of this ordinance unless the destruction amount is less than 50 percent of its fair market value at the time of destruction. 
2.  Destruction greater than 50 percent. If the destruction is greater than 50 percent and less than total, the board of adjustment may, after a public hearing, authorize repair, taking into consideration the property owner's circumstances and the effect on surrounding properties. 
3.  Destruction less than 50 percent. Upon submission by the owner of sufficient evidence to prove that the destruction amounts to less than 50 percent of the fair market value of the entire non-conforming use and that the destroyed building or structure constituted an integral part of the non-conforming use without which the non-conforming use cannot be profitably operated, the board of adjustment may permit the reconstruction of such destroyed building or buildings under conditions which reasonably allow the owner to recoup his original investment. 
4.  Single family residences. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a single family residence which is destroyed shall be permitted to be reconstructed without board of adjustment approval regardless of the extent of destruction provided that the construction complies with all current building codes and is commenced within six months of the date of destruction. The failure of the owner to start such reconstruction within six months shall forfeit the owner's right to restore or reconstruct the dwelling except in conformance with this ordinance. 
5.  Time limit for reconstruction. If the owner of a non-conforming use fails to begin reconstruction of the destroyed building (when permitted to do so by the terms of this ordinance) within six months of the date of destruction or approval by the board of adjustment, the non-conforming building or use shall be deemed to be discontinued or abandoned as provided in subsection F. above. 
H.  Additional limitations and provisions regarding non-conforming uses. 
1.  Change back to non-conforming. A non-conforming use or building, if changed to a conforming use or building, may not be changed back to a non-conforming use or building. 
2.  Accessory uses or structures. No non-conforming accessory use or structure shall continue after the principal use or structure shall have ceased or terminated unless the accessory use or structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of the zoning district in which it is located. 
3.  Vested rights. Nothing contained in this ordinance shall require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of a building or land development project for which a building permit was lawfully issued no more than six months prior to the adoption or amendment or this ordinance, provided, that such construction shall have been started at the time such use became non-conforming and shall have been diligently prosecuted to completion. 
4.  Future non-conformities. The foregoing provisions of this section shall also apply to uses made non-conforming by subsequent amendments to the zoning regulations or by annexation into the city limits. 
5.  Special exceptions. Any use which is permitted as a special exception use by the board of adjustment shall, upon its establishment, be considered a conforming use in that district, provided that this regulation shall not be so interpreted as to waive any conditions placed on the special exception by the board of adjustment. 
6.  The board of adjustment shall, from time to time, on its own motion, or upon cause presented by interested persons, inquire into the existence, continuation or maintenance of any non-conforming use within the city. The board of adjustment may take specific action to abate, remove, limit or terminate any non-conforming use or building under reasonable guidelines as set forth in section 35, board of adjustment. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to take such action. 
I.  Right-of-way acquisition by governmental agency. 
1.  Definitions: As used in this subsection, the following terms shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them:

e.  Right-of-way acquisition shall mean the securing of right-of-way through negotiation, purchase, bargain, trade, donation, eminent domain, or other means but not including the dedication of right-of-way through the platting or zoning process. 
2.  Exemption from Nonconforming Status: 
a.  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in the event a right-of-way acquisition by a governmental agency causes a property or its existing improvements to be in violation of then existing development regulations of this Ordinance, the City Manager is authorized to exempt the property from the provisions of this Ordinance to the extent the violation is caused by the right-of-way acquisition, subject to the provisions set forth in this subsection. Upon approval of such exemption, the property shall be considered to be in conformity with the development regulations of this Ordinance and shall not be subject to the provisions of this section regarding termination, changing or other limitations on nonconforming uses. 
b.  The owner of property eligible for exemption under this subsection may apply to the City Manager for approval of an exemption. The City Manager may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, from the requirements of otherwise applicable development regulations in this Ordinance, after taking into consideration the following factors: 
(1)  Whether the existing use is a permitted use in the zoning district in which it is located. 
(2)  Whether the benefits to the public from exempting the property from the development regulations outweigh any adverse effects that might be caused by noncompliance with such regulations; 
(3)  Whether the exemption will cause the property to be inadequately served by utilities, road access, drainage and other necessary supporting facilities; 
(4)  Whether the location and arrangement of all public and private streets, driveways, parking spaces, entrances and exits provide for a safe and convenient movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic without adversely affecting the general public or the use of adjacent properties; 
(5)  Whether the approval of the exemption will impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of neighboring vacant property; 
(6)  Whether the use of the property will be compatible with and not injurious to the use and enjoyment of neighboring property, nor significantly diminish or impair property values within the vicinity; 
(7)  Whether there is sufficient landscaping and screening to ensure harmony and compatibility with adjacent properties; 
(8)  Whether the property remaining after the right-of-way acquisition is reasonably configured to allow compliance with the development regulations; 
(9)  Whether the owner of the property has made reasonable efforts to meet the development standards applicable to the property; 
(10)  Whether the cost to bring the property into compliance would be unreasonable compared to the benefits that would be gained from doing so. 
c.  In approving an exemption under this subsection, the City Manager may place reasonable terms, conditions, and limitations on the exemption as deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare or that otherwise limit the adverse impact of the property. The City Manager may revoke an exemption if he determines that the property fails or has ceased to be in compliance with any terms, conditions or limitations that are placed on the exemption. 
d.  In granting an exemption under this subsection, the City Manager may authorize the relocation of existing signs that were in compliance with City sign regulations prior to the acquisition of the right-of-way but are required to be moved because of their location within the acquired right-of-way. The City Manager shall determine a location on the property for the relocation of the signs that minimizes the impact of the signs on traffic safety, aesthetics, and the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties. 
e.  Property shall not be eligible for exemption under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Zoning change. An exemption shall not be valid on property that undergoes a zoning change initiated by the property owner subsequent to the right-of-way acquisition; instead, the property shall have a non-conforming status to the extent that any nonconformance with this Ordinance resulted from a right-of-way acquisition by a governmental agency prior to the rezoning, and shall be treated as a nonconforming use or structure pursuant to the provisions of this section. A zoning change initiated by the City shall not cause property to lose the exemption provided by this subsection. 
(2)  Compensation for noncompliance. The exemption shall not apply to property if the right-of-way acquisition is determined to render the remainder of the property unusable pursuant to agreement with the governmental agency or judicial determination, and the governmental agency compensates the property owner for the damage to the remainder. Where such compensation is provided, the property owner is responsible for any curative measures necessary to bring the property into compliance with the development regulations of this Ordinance. 
(3)  Safety hazard. An exemption shall not be granted to any development regulation if doing so would create a traffic safety hazard or other life safety hazard on the property or adjacent thereto. 
f.  The approval or denial of an exemption by the City Manager may be appealed, in whole or in part, to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 35. 
g.  Property not eligible for an exemption under this subsection may still be eligible for a variance under the procedures set forth in Section 35.

Require the discontinuance of a nonconforming use or building under a reasonable plan whereby the owner's investment in the nonconforming use or building can be recouped through amortization over a definite period of time, taking into consideration the general character of the neighborhood and the necessity for all property to conform to the regulations of this ordinance. 
5.  Permit the expansion or extension of a nonconforming use in accordance with the provisions of section 34, nonconforming uses, lots, and structures. 
6.  Within the limits prescribed in section 34, nonconforming uses, lots, and structures, the board may review nonconforming uses which have been abandoned or discontinued to determine whether such uses should be allowed to resume operation. Such action by the board shall consider any unnecessary hardship on the property owner if the use is discontinued and shall have due regard for the public welfare, the character of the area surrounding such use, and the conservation, preservation and protection of surrounding properties and their values; 
7.  Permit the repair or reconstruction and occupancy of a nonconforming building or a building containing a nonconforming use where the building has been destroyed in excess of 50 percent, but less than the total value as provided in section 34, nonconforming uses, lots, and structures provided such reconstruction does not, in the judgment of the board prevent, the return of such property to a conforming use or increase the nonconformity of a nonconforming building beyond what is permitted by section 34, nonconforming uses, lots, and structures. Such action by the board of adjustment shall have due regard for the property rights of the person or persons affected, when considered in light of the public welfare, the character of the area surrounding such structure, and the conservation, preservation and protection of surrounding properties and their values; 
8.  Require the vacation and demolition of a nonconforming structure which is deemed to be obsolete, dilapidated or substandard; 
9.  Permit variances to the development regulations in this ordinance such as front yard, side yard, rear yard, lot width, lot depth, lot coverage, minimum setback, off-street parking, off-street loading, lot area, maximum height, or other development regulations where such variance is necessary to permit the reasonable development of a specific parcel of land which differs from other parcels of land in the same zoning district by being of such area, shape or slope that it cannot be developed in a manner commensurate with the development permitted upon other parcels of land in the same zoning district, or where, due to special conditions: 
a.  The literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would result in an unnecessary and/or unreasonable hardship; 
b.  The special conditions are not the result of the applicant's actions, but are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved; 
c.  The variance requested is the minimum necessary; and 
d.  No special privilege is granted which is denied to other similarly situated uses. 
Any variance granted shall insure that the spirit of the ordinance is observed and substantial justice is done. 
10.  Approve special exception uses which are specifically authorized by this ordinance. A site plan meeting the requirements of section 30, site plan requirements, shall be required to be submitted with each application for a special exception. Any special exceptions authorized by the board, either under the provisions of this ordinance, or under the authority granted to the board under the statutes of the State of Texas, shall authorize the issuance of a building permit for a period of 90 days from the date of the favorable action on the part of the board of adjustment, unless the board in its minutes shall, at the same time, grant a longer period. If a building permit shall not have been issued within said 90-day period or such other period as the board of adjustment may specifically grant, the special exceptions shall be deemed waived, and all rights thereunder terminated. Such termination and waiver shall be without prejudice to a subsequent appeal to said board of adjustment in accordance with the rules and regulations regarding appeals. 
11.  Hear an appeal of an emergency order of closure of an assisted living facility under Section 29.AA., or a request for a reasonable accommodation from the rules, policies, and practices for the location of community homes in this ordinance to permit persons with handicaps or disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. 
a.  A request for reasonable accommodation may be made to the Board by any person with a disability, the person's representative, a developer, or a provider of housing for individuals with disabilities. The request shall state the reason for the accommodation from the zoning and development regulations and the basis for the request. 
b.  The Board shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the request for reasonable accommodation should be granted. The applicant or applicant's representative shall have the burden to demonstrate that: 
(1)  The applicant (or the person on whose behalf the applicant is requesting the accommodation) suffers from a disability as defined by the Fair Housing Act, as amended; and 
(2)  The applicant (or the person on whose behalf the applicant is requesting the accommodation) demonstrates that the accommodation is both reasonable and necessary. An accommodation under this section is "necessary" if, without the accommodation, the applicant will be denied an equal opportunity to obtain the housing of his or her choice. 
c.  If the applicant demonstrates the matter set out in paragraph b. above, the request for reasonable accommodations shall be granted by the Board unless the Board finds from evidence presented at the hearing that the accommodation would fundamentally alter the City's land use and zoning patterns or the impact of the use on its surroundings would be greater than that of other uses permitted in the zoning district. 
C.  Appeals. 
1.  Appeals to the board of adjustment can be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, or board of the municipality affected by any decision of the zoning administrator or any official authorized to make a decision under this ordinance. Such appeal shall be taken within 15 days time after the decision has been rendered by the zoning administrator or other official by filing with the official from whom the appeal is taken and with the board of adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board of adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
2.  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is appealed unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies in writing to the board of adjustment facts supporting the official's opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application after notice to the official and upon a showing of due cause. 
3.  The same appeal to the board of adjustment shall not be allowed on the same piece of property prior to the expiration of one year from a ruling of the board of adjustment. 
D.  Hearing. The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing any party may appear in person or by attorney or agent. The notice provided in this section shall be given by publication in the official city publication stating the time and place of such hearing, which shall not be earlier than ten days from the day of such publication, and in addition thereto, the Board of Adjustment shall mail notices of such hearing to the petitioner and the owners of property lying within 200 feet of any point of the lot or portion thereof, on which a variation or special exception is desired, and to all persons deemed by the board of adjustment to be affected, such owners and persons shall be determined according to the current tax rolls of the city and substantial compliance therewith shall be deemed sufficient, provided, however, that the depositing of such written notice in the mail by the board of adjustment shall be deemed compliance for purpose of this section. 
E.  Concurring vote. The concurring vote of six members of the board of adjustment shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such official, or to decide in favor of the application on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance or to affect any variance in said ordinance. 
F.  Grievances. Any person or persons, jointly or separately, aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment or any taxpayer or any officer, department or board of the city may present to a court of record, a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of such illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within ten days after the rendering of the decision complained of by the board of adjustment, and not thereafter. 
G.  Completion of existing buildings. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plans, construction, or designated use of a building for which a building permit has been heretofore issued and which entire building shall be completed within one year from the date of passage of this ordinance. If any amendment to this ordinance is hereafter adopted changing the boundaries of districts, the provisions of this ordinance with regard to buildings or premises existing or under construction or building permits issued in the area affected by such amendment at the time of the passage of such amendment shall not apply. 
H.  Authorized special exceptions. In addition to those special exception uses listed in the use matrix, section 9, the following special exceptions may be permitted by the board of adjustment, in the district specified, subject to full and complete compliance with any and all conditions listed, together with such other conditions as the board of adjustment may impose.

_____
Sec. 36. - Conditional uses. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the conditional use procedure is to allow for review of uses which would not be appropriate generally or without certain restrictions throughout a zoning district, but which, if controlled as to the number, area, location or relation to the neighborhood would promote the health, safety, and welfare of the community. The procedure is intended to allow broad public review and evaluation of the proposed development and to ensure adequate mitigation of potentially unfavorable impacts. 
B.  Submission and approval requirements and procedure. 
1.  An application for a conditional use permit shall be submitted to the zoning administrator, along with any applicable fee required by section 42, fees, charges and expenses. The application shall include a site plan meeting the requirements of section 30, site plan requirements. 
2.  The zoning administrator shall review the application and submit a report to the planning and zoning commission. This report shall be made available to the applicant prior to the public hearing. 
3.  The city council may approve a conditional use by adoption of an ordinance. The ordinance shall set forth any limitations or conditions which the city council may place upon the conditional use. 
4.  The same notice, hearing and approval requirements set forth in section 39, changes and amendments shall apply to approval of a conditional use permit; provided, however, that the approval of a conditional use permit shall not be considered a change in zoning. 
5.  The planning and zoning commission and the city council shall review the application against the review and evaluation criteria set forth below and approve, conditionally approve, or deny the conditional use application. 
C.  Review and evaluation criteria. The conditional use application shall be reviewed and evaluated using the following criteria: 
1.  Conformance with applicable regulations and standards established by the zoning ordinance. 
2.  Compatibility with existing or permitted uses on abutting sites in terms of building height, bulk, scale, setbacks, open spaces, landscaping and site development, and access and circulation features. 
3.  Potentially unfavorable effects or impacts on existing or permitted uses on adjacent sites, to the extent such impacts exceed those which reasonably may result from use of the site by a permitted use. 
4.  Location, lighting, and type of signs and relation of signs to traffic control and adverse effect on adjacent properties. 
5.  Safety and convenience of vehicular and pedestrian circulation in the vicinity, including traffic reasonably expected to be generated by the proposed use and other uses reasonably anticipated in the area considering existing zoning and land uses in the area. 
D.  Lapse of approval and modifications. 
1.  A conditional use permit shall be valid for one year from the date of approval unless prior to such expiration date a building permit is issued and construction is commenced or the actual use, if not requiring a building permit, is commenced. The expiration date may be extended by the city council upon application. 
2.  Approval of a conditional use permit automatically expires upon any of the following: 
a.  A change in use on the property; or 
b.  A relocation of the use. 
The city council may grant a continuance of the conditional use upon application. 
3.  Minor modifications to a conditional use permit may be made if the zoning administrator determines that such modifications will not change the intent and effect of the approval by the city council. 
Sec. 37. - Certificate of occupancy. 
A.  Certificate of occupancy. No vacant land shall be occupied or used, except for agricultural purposes, and no building hereafter erected, reconstructed, altered, enlarged, vacated or placed upon property shall be occupied or used until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the building official stating that the building or proposed use of the building or premises complies with the building codes and the provisions of this ordinance. 
B.  Certificate of occupancy for a non-conforming use. Certificates of occupancy shall be required for all non-conforming uses. Application for certificate of occupancy for such non-conforming uses shall be filed within 12 months from the effective date of this ordinance, accompanied by affidavits of proof that such non-conforming uses were not established in violation of this ordinance, or any previous zoning ordinance. 
The certificate of occupancy shall state that the building or proposed use of a building or land, complies with all the building and health laws and ordinances and with the provisions of this ordinance. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the building official, and copies shall be furnished, on request, to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or premises affected. (No fee shall be charged for a certificate of occupancy for a non-conforming use.) 
Sec. 38. - Building permits/subdivision requirement. 
    Subdivision requirement. No permit shall be issued for any construction or to establish a use on any site unless the same is identified in an approved subdivision filed in the Tarrant County Plat Records. The use "natural gas drilling/production" shall not be required to plat as required by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2005-002-15, § 1, 1-24-05) 
Sec. 39. - Changes and amendments. 
A.  Generally. The city council may from time to time amend, supplement, or change by ordinance the boundaries of the districts or the regulations herein established. Before taking action on any such proposed amendment, supplement or change, the city council shall submit the same to the planning and zoning commission for its recommendation and report. A public hearing shall be held by the city council before adopting any proposed amendment, supplement, or change, notice of which hearing shall be given by publication one time in the official paper of the city stating the time and place of such hearing, which time shall not be earlier than 15 days from the date of publication. Unless such proposed amendment, supplement, or change has been approved by the planning and zoning commission, or if a protest against such amendment, supplement, or change has been filed with the city secretary, duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20 percent or more, either of the area of the lots included in such proposed change or all property within 200 feet of all boundaries of the proposed change, such amendment, supplement, or change shall not become effective except by a favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the city council. 
B.  Notice. Written notice of all public hearings before the planning and zoning commission on proposed changes in classification shall be sent to all owners of property or to the person rendering the same for City taxes, located within 200 feet of any property upon which the change in classification is proposed, not less than ten days before such hearing is held. Such notice may be served by using the address as listed on the most recent city tax roll and depositing the notice, postage paid, in the United States mail. This shall be the method of notice for all public hearings of the planning and zoning commission and the board of adjustment. 
Sec. 40. - Violations, penalties, and enforcement. 
A.  Fines. Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with, or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this ordinance, shall be fined not more than $2,000.00 for each offense. Each day that a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty should not be construed as exclusive, and the city hereby provides that any other remedy available to it, in law or in equity, is not intended to be, and is not, foreclosed by the provision of such penalty. 
B.  Enforcement. The provisions of this ordinance shall be enforced by the city manager or his duly authorized representatives. The city manager's authorized representatives shall have the right to enter upon any premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of making inspection of buildings or premises necessary to carry out the enforcement of this ordinance. 
Sec. 41. - Injunction. 
    The city shall have and retain the right for injunctive relief against any person, firm, or corporation who is in the process of or about to violate any section, paragraph, or part of this ordinance; such right for injunctive relief shall exist independent of the other penalty provisions of this ordinance and not in lieu thereof. The right of injunctive relief is essential to the city in order that it may maintain an orderly and properly planned control over all land uses, thus protecting the health, morals, safety, and well being of the citizens and halting any attempt by any person, firm, or corporation to inflict temporary or permanent injury on the general public by a failure to comply with the terms of this ordinance. 
Sec. 42. - Fees, charges, and expenses. 
A.  Establishment of schedule of fees. The city council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges, and expenses and a collection procedure for building permits, certificates of zoning compliance, applications, appeals, and other matters pertaining to this ordinance. The schedule of fees shall be posted in the office of the city secretary and may be altered or amended only by the city council. 
B.  Fee payment required. Until all applicable fees, charges, and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any application or appeal. 
Sec. 43. - Cumulative clause. 
    This ordinance shall be cumulative of all provisions of ordinances and of the Code of the City of Haltom City, Texas, except where the provisions of this ordinance are in direct conflict with the provisions of such ordinances and such codes, in which event the conflicting provisions of such ordinances and such codes are hereby repealed. Ordinance No. 97-015-15, as amended, is hereby repealed. 
Sec. 44. - Severability clause. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that the phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this ordinance are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this ordinance shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this ordinance, since the same would have been enacted by the city council without the incorporation in this ordinance of any such unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section. 
Sec. 45. - Savings clause. 
    All rights or remedies of the City of Haltom City, Texas, are expressly saved as to any and all violations of Ordinance No. 97-015-15, or any ordinances governing zoning or land use that have accrued at the time of the effective date of this ordinance; and, as to such accrued violations and all pending litigation, both civil and criminal, whether pending in court or not, under such ordinances, same shall not be affected by this ordinance but may be prosecuted until final disposition by the courts. Any non-conforming use or building under Ordinance No. O-97-015-15 shall continue as a non-conforming use or building under this ordinance unless it is specifically amortized or terminated under this ordinance; however, any use or condition that was in violation of previous zoning ordinances shall not become a non-conforming use under this ordinance but shall be considered as a violation of this ordinance in the same manner that it was a violation of prior zoning ordinances of the city. 
Sec. 46. - Reapplication. 
    Limitations on reapplication. In order that zoning may promote the stability and well-being of the community and may offer certainty to the citizens of the city with respect to the use and development of property, the following requirements shall govern the filing of reapplication for zoning changes. When the applicant has withdrawn his proposal at or after the planning and zoning commission meeting thereon, or when the city council has denied a proposal, no reapplication requesting the same zoning classification shall be accepted by the city or scheduled for hearing by the planning and zoning commission within a period of 12 months of the council's denial or applicant's withdrawal when the city council accepts the withdrawal or denies the proposal without prejudice. Provided, however, on receipt of a request stating how conditions have changed substantially within the community since the prior denial or withdrawal, the planning and zoning commission may waive the mandatory delay period and authorize the acceptance of a new application. 
Sec. 47. - Publication in pamphlet form. 
    The City Secretary of the City of Haltom City is hereby authorized to publish this ordinance in book or pamphlet form for general distribution among the public, and the operative provisions of this ordinance as so published shall be admissible in evidence in all courts without further proof than the production thereof. 
Sec. 48. - Publication in the official newspaper. 
    The City Secretary of the City of Haltom City is hereby directed to publish in the official newspaper of the City of Haltom City, the caption, penalty clause, publication clause, and effective date clause of this ordinance one time within ten days after the first reading of this ordinance as required by Section 10.01 of the Charter of the City of Haltom City. 
Sec. 49. - Effective date. 
    This ordinance shall be effective and be in full force and effect immediately upon its passage and publication as provided by law, and it is so ordained. Passed and approved on second reading this 9th day of September, 2002. 
APPENDIX C - FEE SCHEDULE[1] 
    All persons, firms or corporations applying for licenses, permits or other city services that by their nature require the applicant to pay a fee incident to such application shall pay the fees as prescribed in the "fee schedule," included herein. It shall be a violation of this ordinance to conduct any activity or commence any use for which payment of a fee is required until such fee has been paid. The city council may review the schedule of fees at any time and may, by resolution, increase or decrease said fees within the schedule upon a determination that said increase or decrease is warranted.

Article 13A. - Rough Proportionality
new	
13A-106 Proportionality Determination

1.Prior to a decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission on an application or for approval of a plat or plan for development or prior to a decision on any other application on which an exaction requirement is placed as a condition of approval, including a planned development zoning district or building permit, the City Engineer shall prepare a written statement affirming that each exaction requirement to be imposed as a condition of approval is roughly proportionate to the demand created by the subdivision or development on the applicable public facilities system of the City, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed. In making this determination, the City Engineer may consider:a.categorical findings and recommendations of the North Central Texas Council of Governments in developing standard specifications for public infrastructure improvements and storm water management;b.the proposed and potential use of the land;c.the timing and sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities systems;d.impact fee studies; traffic impact studies (both geometric and capacity oriented); drainage studies; fire protection, consumption and irrigation water needs; solid or liquid waste collection and disposal; or other studies or standards that measure the demand for services created by developments and the impact on the City's public facilities systems;e.the level of service and functionality of both on-site and off-site public infrastructure improvements in serving the proposed subdivision or development;f.the degree to which public infrastructure improvements necessary to serve the proposed subdivision are supplied by other developments;g.the anticipated participation by the City in the costs of necessary public infrastructure improvements;h.the degree to which acceptable private infrastructure improvements to be constructed and maintained by the applicant will offset the need for public infrastructure improvements;i.any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure improvements for which the proposed subdivision is eligible; and/orj.any other information relating to the impacts created by the proposed subdivision or development on the City's public facilities systems.2.Based upon the proportionality determination, the City Engineer shall affirm that the exaction requirements of this Ordinance, or other ordinance requiring the permit, as applied to the proposed subdivision or development, do not impose costs on the applicant for public infrastructure improvements that exceed those roughly proportionate to the impact of the proposed subdivision or development.3.The City Engineer may require that the applicant, at its expense, submit reasonable information or studies that may assist in making the proportionality determination.
13A-107 Rough Proportionality Determination

1.The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall consider the City Engineer's report concerning the proportionality of the exaction requirements in making a decision on a plat application or plan for development. The Commission and the City Council may consider the City Engineer's report in granting a variance to the requirements of this Ordinance pursuant to Article 7 hereof.2.The City official responsible for issuing a permit for which an exaction requirement is imposed as a condition of approval shall consider the City Engineer's report concerning the proportionality of the exaction requirements in making its decision as to whether to grant the permit, or to modify or waive an exaction requirement.
13A-108 Rough Proportionality Appeal

1.An applicant for approval of a plat or plan for development or other permit which imposes an exaction requirement as a condition of approval may file an appeal to contest any exaction requirement, other than impact fees, imposed as a condition of approval or in which the failure to comply is grounds for denying the plat or permit application.2.The purpose of a proportionality appeal is to assure that an exaction requirement imposed on a proposed plat or plan for development as a condition of approval does not result in a disproportionate cost burden on the applicant, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed subdivision or development on the City's public facilities systems.
13A-109 Appeals Procedure

1.An applicant for approval of a plat or plan for development or an applicant seeking approval for any other permit or zoning for which an exaction requirement is imposed shall file a written appeal with the City Secretary within ten (10) days of the date the Planning and Zoning Commission or the city official responsible for issuing the permit takes action applying the exaction requirement. This may include denial of the permit or plat. The applicant shall submit fifteen (15) copies of the appeal.2.A separate appeal form shall be submitted for each exaction requirement for which relief is sought. The City Secretary shall forward the appeal to the City Council for consideration.3.The applicant may request postponement of consideration of the applicant's application by the City Council pending preparation of the study required by subsection (6), in which case the applicant shall also waive any statutory period for acting upon the application for the time necessary for the City Council to decide the appeal.4.No Facilities Agreement may be executed by the City:a.until the time for appeal has expired unless the applicant agrees in writing that the rough proportionality determination of the City Engineer is reasonable and accurate and that no appeal will be filed; or,b.if an appeal is filed, until the City Council has made a determination with respect to the appeal.5.The appeal shall state the reasons that application of the exaction requirement is not roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impact created by the proposed subdivision or development on the City's public facilities systems and does not reasonably benefit the proposed subdivision or development.6.The appellant shall submit to the City Engineer fifteen (15) copies of a study in support of the appeal that includes, with respect to each exaction requirement appealed, the following information within thirty (30) days of the date of appeal, unless a longer time is requested:a.total capacity of the City's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage, or park system, as applicable, to be utilized by the proposed subdivision or development, employing standard measures of capacity and equivalency tables relating the type of development proposed to the quantity of system capacity to be consumed by the subdivision or development. If the proposed subdivision is to be developed in phases, such information also shall be provided for the entire development, including any phases already developed;b.total capacity to be supplied to the City's public facilities systems for water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or parks, as applicable, by the exaction requirement. This information shall include any capacity supplied by prior exaction requirements imposed on the development;c.comparison of the capacity of the applicable City public facilities systems to be consumed by the proposed subdivision or development with the capacity to be supplied to such systems by the proposed exaction requirement. In making this comparison, the impacts on the City's public facilities systems from the entire subdivision or development shall be considered;d.the amount of any City participation in the costs of oversizing the public infrastructure improvements to be constructed by the applicant in accordance with the City's requirements;e.comparison of the minimum size and capacity required by City standards for the applicable public facilities systems to be utilized by the proposed subdivision or development with the size and capacity to be supplied by the proposed exaction requirement; andf.any other information that shows the alleged disproportionality between the impacts created by the proposed development and the exaction requirement imposed by the City.7.The City Engineer shall evaluate the appeal and supporting study and shall make a recommendation to the City Council based upon the City Engineer's analysis of the information contained in the study and utilizing the same factors considered by the Engineer in making the original proportionality determination.
13A-110 City Council Decision

1.The City Council shall decide the appeal within thirty (30) days of the date of final submission of any evidence by the applicant. Upon receipt of the final submission of evidence from the applicant, the City Director of Planning and Inspections shall schedule a time and date for the City Council to consider the appeal and shall cause the applicant to be notified at the address specified in the appeal form of the time, date and location at which the City Council shall consider the appeal.2.The applicant shall be allotted time, not to exceed thirty (30) minutes, to present testimony at the City Council meeting. The Council shall base its decision on the criteria listed in Sections 13A-106.1. and 13A-109.6. and may:a.deny the appeal and impose the exaction requirement in accordance with the City Engineer's recommendation or the Planning and Zoning Commission's decision on the plat or other development application; orb.grant the appeal, and waive in whole or in part an exaction requirement to the extent necessary to achieve proportionality; orc.grant the appeal, and direct that the City participate in the costs of acquiring land for or constructing the public infrastructure improvement.3.In deciding an appeal, the City Council shall determine whether application of the exaction requirement is roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impact created by the proposed subdivision on the City's public facilities systems for water, wastewater, roadway, drainage, or park facilities, as applicable, and reasonably benefits the subdivision. In making such determination, the Council shall consider:a.the evidence submitted by the applicant;b.the City Engineer's report and recommendation, considering in particular the factors identified in Sections 13A-106.1. and 13A-109.6.; andc.if the property is located adjacent to a state or county road, any recommendations from the county or state.4.The City Council may require the applicant or the City Engineer to submit additional information that it deems relevant in making its decision.5.The applicant shall not be deemed to have prevailed in the event that the City Council modifies the exaction requirement.
13A-111 Action Following Decision of City Council

1.If the City Council finds in favor of the applicant and waives the exaction requirement as a condition of plat approval, or modifies the exaction requirement to the extent necessary to achieve rough proportionality, the applicant shall resubmit the plat application to the Planning and Zoning Commission or City official responsible for issuing the permit within thirty (30) days of the date the City Council takes action, with any modifications necessary to conform the plat with the City Council's decision. Failure to do so will result in the expiration of any relief granted by the City Council.2.If the City Council finds in favor of an applicant for any other permit or zoning and waives the exaction requirement as a condition of permit or zoning approval, or modifies the exaction requirement to the extent necessary to achieve rough proportionality, the applicant shall resubmit the permit application to the responsible official within thirty (30) days of the date the City Council takes action, with any modifications necessary to conform the application with the City Council's decision. Failure to do so will result in the expiration of any relief granted by the City Council.3.If the City Council denies the appeal and the applicant has executed a waiver of the statutory period for acting upon a plat, the City shall place the plat application on the agenda of the Planning and Zoning Commission within thirty (30) days of the City Council's decision.4.If the plat application is modified to increase the number of residential dwelling units or the intensity of non-residential uses, the City Manager or City Engineer may require a new study to validate the relief granted by the City Council.5.If the plat application for which relief was granted is denied on other grounds, a new appeal shall be required on any subsequent application.
13A-112 An applicant may appeal the decision of the City Council to the county or district court of the county in which the development is located within 30 days of the date that the City Council issues its final decision. In the event that the applicant prevails in such action, the applicant will be entitled to attorneys' fees and costs, including expert witness fees.

39-103 Adequate Public Facilities

1.Land proposed to be subdivided must be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, including water and wastewater facilities, roadway and pedestrian facilities, drainage facilities and park facilities. An application for a plat or development may be denied unless adequate public facilities necessary to support and serve the development exist or provision has been made for the facilities, whether the facilities are to be located within the property being platted or off-site.2.It is necessary and desirable to provide for dedication of rights-of-way and easements for public works improvements to support new development at the earliest stage of the development process.3.The City desires to assure both that impacts of new development are mitigated through contributions of rights-of-way, easements and construction of capital improvements, and that a new development be required to contribute not more than its proportionate share of such costs.4.Proposed public works improvements serving new development shall conform to and be properly related to the public facilities elements of the City's adopted Master Plan, other adopted master plans for public facilities and services, and applicable capital improvements plans, and shall meet the service levels specified in such plans.
39-104 Minimum Standards

1.The standards established in this Ordinance for dedication and construction of public works improvements and infrastructure are based upon engineering studies and historical usages and demands by different categories of development. These regulations identify certain minimum requirements and sizes for utilities, roadways, parks and other facilities that the City Council has determined to be necessary in order to provide the minimum level of service necessary to protect or promote the public health, safety, and welfare and to assure the quality of life currently enjoyed by the citizens of Haltom City. It is the intent of these regulations that no development occur until and unless these minimum levels of service are met. Therefore, each subdivision in the City shall be required to dedicate, construct and/or upgrade required facilities and infrastructure to a capacity that meets these minimum levels.2.For each category of public infrastructure, a minimum standard of infrastructure, and in some cases, service level, has been developed based upon historic studies and construction projects of the City and other cities. These minimum standards take into consideration the soil conditions and topographic configuration of the City, the use and impact analyses of the North Central Texas Council of Governments in developing standard specifications for public works installation, and other historical use and performance experiences of the City that reflect the minimum level of facilities and services that must be built to meet the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Haltom City.3.In order to maintain prescribed levels of public facilities and services for the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens, the City may require the dedication of easements and rights-of-way for or construction of on-site or off-site public works improvements for water, wastewater, road, drainage or park facilities to serve a proposed subdivision, or require the payment of fees in lieu thereof. If adequate levels of public facilities and services cannot be provided concurrent with the schedule of development proposed, the City may deny the subdivision until the public facilities and services can be provided, or require that the development be phased so that the availability and delivery of facilities and services coincides with the demands for the facilities created by the development.4.Whenever the City Council determines that levels of service in excess of these minimum standards are necessary in order to promote the orderly development of the City, the owner shall qualify for reimbursement for any costs in excess of the minimum levels of service through City participation, to the extent funds are available by a pro rata reimbursement policy or other means adopted by the City.
39-105 Adequacy of Specific Facilities

1.All lots to be platted shall be connected to a public water system which has capacity to provide water for domestic use and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection.2.All lots to be platted shall be served by an approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. The City Engineer shall be responsible for determining the approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. The City may require the phasing of development and/or improvements in order to maintain adequate wastewater capacity.3.Proposed roads shall provide a safe, convenient and functional system for vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation and shall be properly related to the applicable Thoroughfare Plan and any amendments thereto, and shall be appropriate for the particular traffic characteristics of each proposed subdivision or development. New subdivisions shall be supported by a thoroughfare network having adequate capacity, and safe and efficient traffic circulation. Each development shall have adequate access to the City's roadway system.4.Stormwater management and drainage facility improvements serving new development shall be designed to prevent overloading the capacity of the downstream drainage system and to protect downstream facilities and properties from flood risk or environmental quality degradation and to maximize the preservation of natural floodplain features. The City may require the phasing of development, the use of control methods such as retention, detention, the construction of off-site drainage improvements, storm water best management practices or drainage impact fees in order to mitigate the impacts of the proposed subdivision.
39-106 Improvement of Adjacent and Abutting Existing Streets and Utilities

In the case of existing adjacent or abutting roads, the City may require that right-of-way be dedicated and/or improved to the City's design standards, based upon factors including the impact of the proposed subdivision on the road, safety to the traveling public, geometric conflicts, capacity interruptions, condition, structural capability, effects on life expectancy and maintenance requirements of the road, the impact of the proposed subdivision on other roads, the timing of this development in relation to need for improving the road, the impact of the traffic on the road and City's roadway system as a whole.

39-107 Timing of Dedication and Construction

1.The City shall require an initial demonstration that a proposed subdivision shall be adequately served by public facilities and services at the time for approval of the first development application that portrays a specific plan of development, including but not limited to a petition for establishing a planned development zoning district, or other overlay zoning district; or a community facilities agreement; or an application for approval of a plat.2.The obligation to dedicate rights-of-way for or to construct one (1) or more public works improvements to serve a new subdivision may be deferred until approval of a subsequent phase of the subdivision, at the sole discretion of the City Engineer, upon written request of the property owner, or at the City's own initiative. As a condition of deferring the obligation, the City may require that the subdivider include provisions in the facilities agreement, specifying the time for dedication of rights-of-way for or construction of public works improvements serving the subdivision.

Classification	FunctionsUses
Local Street	A street which distributes traffic to and from residences. It is short in length and non-continuous to discourage through traffic. It serves low-density residential/single family uses.
Minor Collector	A street which carries traffic from local streets to other collector streets. Also, it may serve local facilities such as schools and churches, low and medium density residential, limited commercial facilities, elementary schools, some small offices and as direct access within industrial parks.
Major Collector	A street which carries traffic from collector streets to arterials. Also, it may serve local facilities such as schools, churches, fast food restaurants and mini-malls, medium and high density residential, limited commercial facilities, elementary schools, offices and as direct access within industrial parks.
Minor Arterial	A street which receives traffic from collectors and distributes traffic to major arterials and activity centers. Also, it may feed through-traffic to freeways. Further it serves uses such as high schools, universities, other major educational/vocational facilities, and concentrations of high-density residential, commercial facilities.
Major Arterial	A street which receives traffic from collectors and distributes it to major activity centers. Also, it feeds through-traffic to freeways.

Art. 50. - Water Facilities
new	
50-100 General

All subdivisions developed subsequent to this ordinance shall be provided with an approved water system. In the absence of specific standards contained in this ordinance, all water supply, distribution, pumping, and storage improvements shall be designed in accordance with the most current standards of the American Water Works Association and the most current edition of "Rules and Regulations for Public Water Systems" of the Texas Department of Health Resources and Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) Regulations. Materials and construction shall meet the requirements of Haltom City standard details and specifications for water and sanitary sewer construction.

50-101 Basic Requirements

1.All water mains in residential areas shall be a minimum of six inches (6") in size and looped. Water mains in industrial and commercial areas shall be a minimum eight inches (8") in size.2.The City may participate in the cost of any oversize lines required to serve land areas and improvements beyond the subdivision. The City's participation will be the difference in the actual construction cost of the oversized line and the estimated construction cost, as determined by the City's Engineer, of the line properly sized to serve only the land area of the development.3.The cost of mains larger than six inches (6") must be borne by the subdivider or developer if such larger main is required to adequately serve the subdivision.4.Standard fire hydrants shall be installed as a part of the water distribution system. Fire hydrants in a mercantile and industrial area shall be on street intersections and so located that there will be a fire hydrant every three hundred (300) feet. Fire hydrants in a residential area shall be located on all street intersections and not over five hundred feet (500') apart. Fire hydrants shall be considered as the actual fire hydrant, six inch (6") valve, "tee", and the necessary piping.5.Valves of approved design shall be installed at the intersections of all water mains so as to provide for proper maintenance and operation of the system and to provide a means of shutting off the supply to portions of the systems for repairs. Sufficient valves shall be installed to cause no more than fifteen (15) lots to be out of service in the event of a water main break.6.The depth of cover shall be a minimum of thirty-six inches (36") below finished grade.7.Pipeline Markers will be used to locate road crossings and cross country lines in rural areas.8.Valve markers shall be provided in rural areas.9.Corporation stops and meter boxes shall be provided at all services.10.Adequate Air Relief, draining, and flushing valves must be provided for flushing, disinfection, daily operation requirements, and repairs.11.All water mains installed within a subdivision must extend to the borders of the subdivision as required for future extensions of the water distribution system regardless of whether or not such extensions are required for service within the subdivision. At the end of such water main, a fire hydrant assembly shall be installed plus an additional valve for any future extensions.
Art. 51. - Sanitary Sewerage Facilities
new	
51-100 General

All subdivisions developed subsequent to this Ordinance shall be provided with an approved sewerage disposal system conforming to the current criteria adopted by the City and the requirements of Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Regulations. Materials and construction shall meet the requirements of Haltom City Standard Details and Specifications for Water and Sanitary Sewer Construction.

51-101 Basic Requirements

1.Generally, sanitary sewer mains shall be eight inches (8") in nominal diameter or greater. Sanitary sewer mains of six inches (6") diameter can only be installed when all four (4) of the following criteria are met:i.the main is less that 250 lineal feet in length;ii.the main is installed straight (NOT on a curve);iii.there is no possible way the main can be extended onto in the future: andiv.manholes are installed on both ends of the six inch (6") main.2.All sanitary sewers shall be designed with consideration for serving the full drainage area subject to collection by the sewer in question except as modified with the concurrence of the City's Engineer because of the projected rate of development or the financial feasibility of the proposed extension.3.Manholes shall be located at all intersections of other sanitary sewers and at intermediate spacings along the line. Generally the maximum spacing should not exceed five hundred feet (500'). Manholes should be located at all changes in grade and at the ends of all sanitary sewers that will be extended or not extended; i.e., clean-outs will not be allowed.4.Sanitary sewers should be designed with straight alignment whenever possible. When horizontal curvatures must be used, the smallest radius should be determined by the pipe manufacturers data, but in no case less than a one hundred (100) foot radius shall be used.5.All sanitary sewers shall be designed with hydraulic slopes sufficient to give mean velocities, when flowing full or half full, of not less than two (2') feet per second on Kutter's or Manning's formulas using an "n" value of 0.013.6.No connection shall be made to any sanitary sewerage system within the City which will permit the entrance of surface water and waste of other than domestic sewage characteristics.7.All materials and workmanship incorporated in the sanitary sewage system extensions shall be in accordance with the currently adopted Haltom City Standard Details and Specifications for Water and Sanitary Sewer Construction.8.All lateral and sanitary sewer mains installed within a subdivision must extend to the borders of the subdivision as required for future extensions of the collecting system regardless of whether or not such extensions are required for service within the subdivision.9.All service laterals below proposed areas to be paved shall be installed and properly backfilled prior to compaction of the subgrade and placement of the paving.10.Any service lateral used for the discharge of industrial waste into the City's sanitary sewers shall have a control manhole constructed and maintained by the discharger of the industrial waste. The control manhole shall be constructed downstream from any storage tanks or pretreatment works and shall be used by the City for sampling and monitoring the industrial waste.
Part XII - FACILITIES AGREEMENT

Art. 52. - Facilities Agreement
new	
52-100 The subdivider shall be required to enter into an agreement with the City which will govern his subdivision if there are off-site utility extensions, off-site street extensions and/or modifications, perimeter street construction and/or modifications, perimeter street ordinance responsibilities, sidewalk ordinance responsibilities, pro-rata payments, city participation and cost, escrow deposits or other future considerations, waivers granted to the ordinance or other nonstandard development regulation. This agreement shall be based upon the requirements of this section and shall provide the city with specific authority to complete the improvements required in the agreement in the event of failure by the developer and to recover the full legal cost of such measures. The City may subordinate the facilities agreement to the prime lender if provided for in said agreement.

52-101 The facilities agreement shall be a legally binding agreement between the City and the developer specifying the individual and joint responsibilities of both the City and the developer. Unusual circumstances relating to the subdivision shall be considered in the facilities agreement such that the purpose of this ordinance best served for each particular subdivision. Such facilities agreement may stipulate pro-rata payments, city participation in unusual facilities, escrow deposits or other payments for future facilities, waivers granted to this ordinance and other particular aspects of the development. The developer shall include in such agreement a hold harmless indemnity clause agreeing to hold the city harmless against any claim arising out of this developer's subdivision or any actions taken therein.

52-102 The developer shall have a continuing responsibility under this facilities agreement after the filing of the final plat and until all facilities and improvements required under this facilities agreement have been completed. When the construction of required improvements has proceeded to the point that certain parts of the subdivision are adequately served, the City Manager may release specified portions of the subdivision prior to the completion of all improvements. This shall not be done if the release of such improvements would jeopardize or hinder the continued construction of required improvements, and the facilities agreement shall remain in force for all portions of the subdivision for which a release has not been executed.

52-103 The facilities agreement shall be recorded in the Tarrant County Courthouse at the same time the final plat is recorded.
