All state law references were deleted as being obsolete. Obvious typographical errors and misspellings have been corrected without notation. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

    The following paragraphs are reprinted from the preface of the 1966 Code: 
This volume contains the Charter and Code of Ordinances of the City of Eagle Pass. The Code is a revision and codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature that were deemed advisable to be included. It is the first such revision and codification for the City of Eagle Pass. 
This code is an entire new codification and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole are included herein. Special ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating, and opening specified streets, etc., are not included herein. For more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
As will be noted, the chapters have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also directed to the appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws. 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 25 is 25-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3, respectively. Sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions to provide for future expansion. 
New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number, i.e., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. A new chapter appearing between Chapters 12 and 121/2 will be designated Chapter 121/4, etc. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
The source of each section is included in the history note in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of this Code. 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the innovation of the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this new looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such subsequent amendments, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
The general index of the Code and Charter Index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
The publishers are most grateful to all city officials and employees for their supervision, cooperation and interest during the preparation of this Code. Special appreciation is due Mr. Charles L. Brazil, City Manager and Mr. Gerald D. Becker, City Attorney, for their efforts and assistance to the publishers. 
The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Mr. George R. Langford, President, and Mr. Benjamin K. Phipps, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Eagle Pass.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
PREAMBLE 
    WE, the citizens of Eagle Pass, Texas, in order to perpetuate the American tradition of self-government, to provide an established municipal government, and to provide for the progress which always emanates from a government of, by, and for the people, do hereby adopt this city charter in accordance with the statutes of the State of Texas, and do hereby declare the residents of the City of Eagle Pass, Maverick County, Texas, living within the established boundaries of Eagle Pass, to be a political subdivision of the State of Texas incorporated under the name of "City of Eagle Pass" with such powers, rights, and duties as herein provided. 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The Home Rule Charter for the City of Eagle Pass was adopted at a special election held on January 30, 1964, and is included herein for the convenience of the users of this Code. Essentially, the charter has been published in its original form without significant changes in numbering, catchlines, or wording of the text. In the Code of Ordinances portion of this volume, frequent references have been made to the charter as a citation of authority. 

ARTICLE I. - FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND BOUNDARIES 

Sec. 1-1. - Form of government. 
    The municipal government provided by this charter shall be known as the council-manager government. Pursuant to its provisions and subject only to the limitations imposed by the state constitution, the statutes of this state, and by this charter, all powers of the city shall be vested in an elective council, hereinafter referred to as the city council, which shall enact local legislation, adopt budgets, determine policies and appoint the city manager, who in turn shall be held responsible to the city council for the execution of the laws and the administration of the government of the city. All powers of the city shall be exercised in the manner prescribed in this charter, or if the manner shall not be prescribed, then in such manner as may be prescribed by ordinance, the state constitution or the statutes of the state. 
Sec. 1-2. - Boundaries-Generally. 
    The inhabitants of the City of Eagle Pass, Texas, within the corporate limits as now established or as hereafter established in the manner provided by law, shall continue to be a municipal body politic and corporate in perpetuity, under the name of the "City of Eagle Pass," hereinafter referred to as the "city". 
Sec. 1-3. - Same-Extension or contraction. 
    The city council shall have the power to fix, by ordinance, the boundary limits of the city and to provide, by ordinance, for the annexation of additional territory lying adjacent to the city, with or without the consent of the inhabitants of the territory to be annexed. The city council shall have the power to detach, by ordinance, any territory with or without the consent of the inhabitants of such area to be detached. When any territory shall be so annexed, the same shall be a part of the city and the property situated therein shall bear its prorata part of the taxes levied by the city, and the inhabitants thereof shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of all the citizens, including the right to vote in municipal elections, and shall be bound by the acts, ordinances, resolutions, and regulations of the city. When territory has been so detached, the same shall no longer be a part of the city. However, it is specifically provided that the city council shall have the authority to annex property to the city by an ordinance passed under its emergency powers and without giving notice thereof when a petition is duly presented bearing the signatures of all of the owners of the property sought to be annexed. And as to tax bonds issued while any subsequently detached territory was within the city limits, such territory shall continue to bear its share of taxation relative to the payment and retirement of such bonds until same are paid and retired. 
    The city council may by ordinance annex territory lying adjacent to the city with or without the consent of the inhabitants in such territory or the owners thereof, not inconsistent with the procedural rules prescribed by law applicable to cities operating under charters adopted or amended under Article XI, Section 5 of the Constitution of the State of Texas. 
Sec. 1-4. - Limited purpose annexation. 
    In addition to the power to annex additional territory for all purposes, the city shall have the power, by ordinance, to fix, alter, and extend the corporate boundary limits of the city for the limited purposes of "planning and zoning" and "sanitation and health protection," and to annex for one or both of such limited purposes additional territory lying adjacent to the city, with or without the consent of the property owners or inhabitants of such annexed territory; provided, however, that no such territory which lies farther than five (5) miles from the corporate boundary limits enclosing the territory which is a part of the city for all purposes, as those corporate boundary limits are now or may hereafter be established, shall be annexed for any limited purpose or purposes. Wherever the boundary limits of territory annexed for one or both of such limited purposes are not coterminous with the corporate boundary limits enclosing the territory which is a part of the city for all purposes, such boundary limits of the limited purpose territory shall be known as "limited purpose boundary limits." Every ordinance by which territory is to be annexed to the city for one or both such limited purposes shall state clearly the limited purpose or purposes for which it is being annexed, and shall be published one time, in the official newspaper of the City of Eagle Pass and in the form in which it is to be finally adopted, not less than thirty (30) days prior to its final passage. When any additional territory has been annexed for one or both of said limited purposes, it shall be a part of the city for such limited purpose or purposes only. However, in dealing with the property and inhabitants thereof, the city shall have each and every power which it otherwise possesses and which is reasonable and expedient for the accomplishment of the limited purpose or purposes for which such territory is annexed, and the power of the city to deal with the property and inhabitants of such limited purpose territory shall include the powers enumerated in the next two succeeding sentences but shall not be limited or restricted thereto. With regard to territory annexed for the limited purpose of "planning and zoning", the city shall have the power to control and regulate the use of property and the density of structures, to require compliance with reasonable zoning regulations, to control and regulate the construction of buildings. With regard to territory annexed for the limited purpose of "sanitation and health protection," the city shall have the power to adopt all reasonable regulations pertaining to sanitation and public health and to require compliance with such regulations. Every inhabitant of territory annexed for one or both of said limited purposes shall be deemed to be a citizen of the city in connection with any city ordinance, regulation, or action which is, or is alleged to be applicable to him or his property because of such limited purpose annexation. The city shall have no power to levy any tax for municipal purposes on either the property or the inhabitant of territory annexed for limited purpose or purposes, and no funds of the city shall be spent in such territory except where reasonable and expedient for the accomplishment of the limited tax purpose or purposes for which the territory is annexed; but the city may collect reasonable charges from property owners and inhabitants of such territory for services rendered by the city in the accomplishment of the limited purpose or purposes for which the territory is annexed. 
ARTICLE II. - POWERS OF THE CITY

Any city-owned utility, or other revenue producing property or facility currently owned or acquired in the future, except the waterworks system, shall be operated by a board of trustees. Such boards shall be appointed by a majority vote of the city council. Trustees must have the same qualifications as members of the city council. 
(ii)  Such boards as appointed by the city council shall consist of four (4) trustees and the Mayor as an ex-officio member. The trustees initially appointed by the City Council shall serve staggered terms of 4, 3, 2, and 1 year. The council shall designate the position number and length of term of each initial appointee and thereafter future appointments shall be for a four-year term. New trustees shall be appointed at the expiration of the term each July 1, or upon retirement or removal by a majority vote of the City Council.

Not later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the date on which the board acts, the city council may approve or disapprove any action by the board. If the city council disapproves the act, the act is ineffective. Otherwise, the act becomes effective on the date the city council approves the act or on the fifteenth (15th) day after the date on which the board acted whichever is first.

The trustees shall be appointed by a majority vote of the board of trustees of the waterworks system; provided, however, that such appointment shall only take effect upon subsequent approval by a majority vote of the city council. Trustees must have the same qualifications as members of the city council, except that trustees may live outside the city limits but within the area served by the waterworks system. 
(ii)  The waterworks system board of trustees shall consist of four (4) trustees and the mayor as ex-officio member.

The trustees initially appointed by the trustees and ratified by the city council shall serve staggered terms of four (4), three (3), two (2), and one (1) year. The city council shall designate the position number and length of term of each initial appointee and thereafter future appointments shall be for a four (4) year term.

(iii)  The board of trustees shall select from among its members a chairperson and a vice-chairperson who shall serve for one (1) year. A vacancy that occurs more than sixty (60) days before the expiration date of a term shall be filled promptly for the unexpired term. A trustee who is appointed to the board to serve out an unexpired portion of a retired trustee's term shall not be considered to have served a "term" unless the unexpired portion of the term so served is two (2) years or more. A trustee may be removed for cause, after a hearing, by a majority vote of board of trustees, subject however, to ratification of that action by a majority vote of the city council. 
(iv)  The board shall meet no less than once a month to hear a report by the manager, and be subject to call meetings as often as the need should arise. 
(v)  Each trustee of the board, including the mayor, may receive a monthly compensation of ten dollars ($10.00) for service on the board. 
(vi)  The board may not levy an ad valorem tax and may not issue bonds. Water rates shall be set by the city council. In addition, the board of trustees shall authorize the completion of an audit, by an outside agency, of the operations of the waterworks system at the same frequency that the city council authorizes the completion of an audit, by an outside agency, of the operations of the City of Eagle Pass. However, any such audit authorized by the board of trustees shall employ the same auditors as employed by the City of Eagle Pass, and the findings of that auditor regarding the waterworks system shall be delivered, without delay, to the city council for its review. 
(vii)  The manager, or a designated employee, of the waterworks system shall deposit on a daily basis money generated by the utility in a bank or trust company in accordance with instructions from the city council and in accordance with the instruments authorizing debt secured by revenues generated by such utility. 
(viii)  The waterworks system shall, upon completion of payment of all bonded indebtedness, continue to be operated by its board as provided in the ordinance or indenture and shall otherwise program its operation as allowed by ordinance or indenture to insure sound principles of economy in management, but such boards may be reconstituted as provided in this subsection.

(a)  Hours of work. The city manager shall determine the business hours for the various city offices and departments, although individual employees may be directed to work hours outside of the city's normal business hours, depending on the city's particular needs. All employees are expected to report to work on time and maintain consistent attendance during these business hours. No city department shall be left unattended during business hours unless authorized by the city manager. 
    The standard workweek for city employees other than firefighters shall be forty (40) hours. Firefighters shall work shifts of twenty-four (24) hours on duty with forty-eight (48) hours off duty.

Any employee who is unable to report to work shall advise his/her immediate supervisor by any reasonable means no later than fifteen (15) minutes before the employee should report to work, or as otherwise determined by departmental guidelines. It shall be the responsibility of all department heads and supervisors to provide each employee under their supervision with their respective telephone numbers so that said employee may be able to contact them when necessary. 
(c)  Time records. Employees must record all hours worked on a daily basis, including lunch breaks and overtime, via the city's time records system. Under no circumstances shall any employee record hours worked for another employee. Falsification, failure to properly record hours worked, and/or failing to "clock in" at the beginning or end of an employee's shift or break may subject an employee to disciplinary action, including termination. 
    Department heads (or their designees) are responsible for approving time records submitted by employees within their department. Employees are responsible for accurately recording all hours worked and promptly correcting any errors in their time records as soon as it comes to their attention. The employee and the department head (or designee) shall be responsible for resolving any discrepancies or errors in the employee's time records. 
(d)  Rest and meal breaks. Generally, all employees shall be entitled to a designated meal break for up to one (1) hour.

Breaks for nursing mothers . 
    Employees who are nursing mothers and require breaks for the purpose of expressing milk in the workplace should discuss accommodations with their immediate supervisor, department head and/or the human resources department. 
(e)  Employee safety program. The city is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all employees, as embodied in the employee safety program of the City of Eagle Pass, which is available from the Human Resources department. Whenever possible, city employees will be reminded of the hazards, proper work methods and appropriate measures and equipment to use when performing their work. 
(1)  Duty to perform work in a safe manner: Employees are responsible for conducting their work activities in a manner that is protective of their own health and safety, as well as that of other employees. Employees have a duty to report any conditions that in their judgment threaten the health and safety of employees or visitors to their supervisors or department heads. 
(2)  Duty to report injuries: Employees must report every on-the-job accident or injury, no matter how minor, to their supervisor or department head immediately, or as soon as practicable. Accident reports must be filed within twenty-four (24) hours to the human resources department. The director of human resources, or designee, shall be responsible for filing all incident reports with the city's worker's compensation insurance carrier. Failure to report an on-the-job injury, no matter how minor, could result in the denial of worker's compensation benefits. 
(f)  Weapon-free workplace. The city has the legal right to prohibit weapons in the workplace, including those firearms that are carried in compliance with Texas law. Accordingly, the city prohibits the possession or use of weapons, including firearms, knives, and explosives on city premises and city-owned vehicles. This prohibition does not include city employees who are required to carry a weapon in connection with their duties and responsibilities (e.g. law enforcement personnel). Moreover, employees who hold a license to carry a handgun pursuant to state law, and who otherwise lawfully possess a firearm or ammunition may transport or store their firearm or ammunition in the employee's locked, privately-owned, motor vehicle in the parking area designated for city employees. 
    Any employee who violates this policy is subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment. 
    Employees must report any violation of this policy. Failure to report a violation of this policy may subject an employee to disciplinary action, including termination of employment. 
(g)  Workplace searches. The city reserves the right to make general or random searches of city property, such as lockers, closets, and desks, for alcohol, prohibited drugs, or drug paraphernalia without the consent of the employee. The use of privately owned padlocks or other locking mechanisms for city property is prohibited. 
    Personal containers such as lunch boxes, purses, briefcases, vehicles, and so on, may be subject to search at any time if a reasonable suspicion exists that evidence of misconduct may be found. If the employee is available, he or she will be asked to consent to the search. If the employee does not consent, the search will not be conducted, but the employee's refusal to cooperate may subject the employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. No search of personal containers will be conducted in the employee's absence. 
    Any search will be conducted as privately as possible, involving only persons with a need to know and only with the authorization of the city manager, or designee. 
(h)  No-smoking policy. Smoking or the use of tobacco products (including but not limited to: cigarettes, pipes, cigars, electronic cigarettes, vaping, snuff, or chewing tobacco) is prohibited in any building or vehicle owned, leased or rented by the city. Employees may smoke outside in designated areas during designated breaks (see Rest and Meal Breaks), so long as such use does not interfere with the employee's work, fitness for duty, or professional appearance. The privilege to use tobacco products during breaks may be withdrawn if abused. 
(i)  Political activity. While employees are encouraged to vote and exercise their civic rights, any and all political activity by a city employee while such employee is on duty is strictly prohibited. Employees should refrain from stating their opinions or views on any political issues or candidates, while in execution of their official position. 
    The political activities of civil service employees are governed by the city's civil service rules. 
(j)  Moonlighting. Before employees may engage in moonlighting (see Definitions), employees must notify and obtain approval from their department head and the city manager. Such outside employment or activities may not interfere with or adversely affect the employee's job performance with the city and shall not present or create a conflict of interest with the employee's position in the city. 
(k)  No-solicitation policy. To avoid disruptions in the workplace, solicitations, whether for a charitable or commercial purpose, and the promotion, distribution, or circulation of pamphlets, literature, or any other material by city employees or non-employees on city property is prohibited during business hours. 
    The posting of any leaflets, notices, literature, or other material on city property without permission of the city manager, or designee, is strictly prohibited. Any employee who violates any of the above rules may be subject to disciplinary action.

Sec. 2-27. - Dress code policy. 
(a)  Statement of policy. The city believes it is very important that all city employees dress appropriately for their job functions and maintain a clean, neat, and tasteful appearance. For this reason, the city has adopted a dress code for all employees. While we trust our employees will exercise good judgment in their dress and appearance, a dress code policy provides guidance to all employees and enhances professionalism in the workplace. Appropriate dress and hygiene are important in promoting a positive city image to our residents, both internally and externally. 
(b)  Responsibility and enforcement. Department heads and supervisors, in consultation with the human resources department, are responsible for enforcing the city's dress code and addressing concerns with employees who do not comply with this policy.

An example is "jean Fridays" when certain personnel are allowed to wear jeans. On these occasions, employees are still expected to present a neat appearance and are not permitted to wear ripped, frayed or disheveled clothing, athletic wear, or other prohibited attire.

(Ord. No. 2018-27, § 1, 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 2-29. - Compensation and evaluations. 
(a)  Pay plan and job classification plan. Employees shall be paid in accordance with the pay plan and job classification plan formulated by the city manager and adopted by the city council. The city's job classification plan shall indicate whether an employee's position is designated as exempt or non-exempt for purposes of determining eligibility for overtime pay or compensatory time off. 
(b)  Payroll schedule. The city manager shall determine the applicable pay period and payroll schedule for all city employees. 
(c)  Payroll deductions. The city is required by law to make certain deductions from an employee's paycheck, including for various payroll taxes, court-ordered garnishments, retirement contributions and statutorily-required wage attachments. These deductions will be itemized on an employee's paycheck and will depend on each employee's earnings and the information furnished on the employee's W-4 form regarding the number of dependents and/or exemptions claimed. 
    Employees shall have the right to make a written request for other deductions to be made from their paychecks, such as premiums for voluntary or cafeteria plans, provided that at least twenty-five (25) percent of all eligible employees participate as a group. Otherwise, employees shall individually make payment and collection arrangements with the insurance carrier. To the extent an employee owes money to the city, the city will make a payroll deduction in the amount owed to the city directly from the employee's earnings, subject to applicable law. 
(d)  Overtime/compensatory time off. Employees are expected to perform and complete their duties during the city's normal business hours. However, on occasion employees may be required to work in excess of the city's normal workweek, which is generally forty (40) hours. Employees shall be expected to work overtime when necessary and as directed and approved by their supervisors. Employees may be subject to disciplinary action for failing to stay or report for overtime work, or for working overtime without their supervisor's directive or prior approval. 
Non-exempt employees . 
For non-exempt employees, (other than firefighters), all actual hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per workweek shall be considered overtime. For employees engaged in fire protection activities, all actual hours worked in excess of the city's defined work cycle (e.g. 212 hours in a 28-day cycle) will be deemed overtime. A non-exempt employee who is on vacation, sick leave, civic leave, etc. during the workweek is not performing actual work and those hours will not count towards the total hours worked during the workweek for purposes of computing overtime. 
Overtime hours must be paid at a rate of one and one-half (11/2) times an employee's regular rate of pay. However, as an alternative allowed under federal law, the city has elected to award certain non-exempt employees compensatory time off in lieu of overtime compensation. Compensatory time off shall be awarded at the rate of one and one-half (11/2) hours for each overtime hour worked in a workweek, subject to the limits established under the FLSA (e.g. two hundred forty (240) hours for non-public safety personnel; four hundred eighty (480) hours for public safety personnel). Hours in excess of the limits for banked compensatory time shall be paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half (11/2) times the employee's regular rate of pay. 
The city manager shall determine which departments receive overtime pay and which departments shall be awarded compensatory time off. 
Use of compensatory time off . 
Department heads and supervisors shall ensure employees are permitted to use compensatory time off on the date(s) requested unless granting the request would unduly disrupt departmental operations. To the extent possible, employees and supervisors should try to schedule compensatory time off in the same workweek it is earned. The department head and director of human resources, or designee, must authorize and approve any work that will cause an employee to exceed the limits for banked compensatory time. Department heads and supervisors may require an employee to use his/her compensatory time to avoid exceeding the limits on banked compensatory time. 
Exempt employees . 
Exempt employees are paid a fixed amount of compensation for all duties and responsibilities required of their position. Exempt employees should understand they are exempt from overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act, even if they work in excess of forty (40) hours per workweek to fulfill their duties. 
(e)  Call-back compensation. On occasion, certain employees may be called back to work upon completion of the normal workday due to an emergency or some other need. In those instances, non-exempt employees who are called back to work after their regular work shift shall be paid for a minimum of two (2) hours, even if they work less than two (2) hours. If the employee works more than two (2) hours, the employee shall be paid for all actual time worked. For the purpose of overtime computation, repeated callbacks within the same two-hour timeframe shall be considered part of the first call back. If an employee is scheduled to report to work, it is not a call back. 
(f)  Payment for hospitalization. Any regular full-time employee who is hospitalized for three (3) or more days due to personal illness or disability, shall be entitled to the benefit of compensation at a rate of sixteen (16) hours of pay for each full year of employment service, or twenty-four (24) hours in the case of firefighters working on the line, subject to a maximum cap of one hundred sixty (160) hours (or two hundred forty (240) hours for firefighters). This compensation benefit shall apply only when all other paid leave, including accrued hours, has been exhausted. 
    To claim this payment, the employee must provide proof of hospitalization and/or a certification from a medical provider. Upon receipt of compensation under this policy, an employee shall not be eligible to request this compensation benefit for any subsequent hospitalization in a one-year period. 
(g)  Payment of available vacation or sick leave. Generally, the city will not authorize requests for pay in lieu of vacation or sick leave unless it is paid in connection with an employee's termination pay or in cases of financial hardship. The existence of a "financial hardship" will be determined on a case-by-case basis but generally refers to a situation in which an employee, or the employee's spouse or dependent, has an immediate and heavy financial need due to: (1) certain medical expenses; (2) payments necessary to prevent eviction from, or foreclosure on, a principal residence; (3) burial or funeral expenses; and (4) certain expenses for the repair of damage to the employee's principal residence or motor vehicle. Payment of available leave based on financial hardship may not exceed the amount of the employee's need. 
Civil service employees are eligible to receive payment in lieu of available vacation hours. 
Procedure . 
Payment of available vacation or sick leave on account of financial hardship shall be paid only if there is available funding; the payment does not reduce an employee's sick leave balance to less than forty (40) hours; and the employee submits substantiating documentation. The department head must make a recommendation to the city manager for approval of any request for payment, except in the case of requests by the city manager, city attorney, municipal court judge, alternate municipal court judge or city auditor, which requests shall be presented to the city council for consideration and approval. 
To the extent an employee's request is granted, payment will be made in the following order and manner: 
(1)  Reserve sick leave hours accumulated above two hundred forty (240) hours for regular employees at fifty percent (50%) of the employee's regular rate of pay. 
(2)  Sick leave hours of two hundred forty (240) hours or less for regular employees at one hundred percent (100%) of the employee's regular rate of pay. 
(3)  Available vacation hours at one hundred percent (100%) of the employee's regular rate of pay. 
Restrictions . 
An employee who requests and receives payment in lieu of available vacation and sick leave hours shall not be eligible to request compensation due to hospitalization (see above) for a period of twelve (12) months from the date the request for payment in lieu of available leave is approved. An employee is also restricted from making another request for payment in lieu of available leave for a period of twelve (12) months from the date the first request is approved. 
(h)  Longevity pay. Per state law, members of the fire department who engage in the duties of "fire protection personnel" and members of the police department who have been licensed as a peace officer by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement are entitled to longevity pay upon completion of one (1) year of service. Such pay shall be at the statutory rate per month for each year of uninterrupted, continuous service in the department, not to exceed twenty-five (25) years. Interruptions of employment shall be those specifically caused by terminations and shall not include authorized leaves of absences. Longevity pay shall be paid in a lump sum by the end of each fiscal year. 
    All other city employees may receive longevity pay if funding allows, as determined by the city council. Any such payments shall be paid in a lump sum at the end of each fiscal year. 
(i)  Termination pay. Upon separation from employment for reasons other than gross misconduct, regular full-time non-civil service employees shall receive the following pay and benefits: 
(1)  All available vacation time; 
(2)  All available sick leave up to the cap of two hundred forty (240) hours; 
(3)  All accumulated compensatory time off; and 
(4)  COBRA benefits, to the extent of the employee's eligibility. 
In the case of employment separation due to the employee's death, the employee's accrued benefits will be paid to the employee's designated beneficiary. 
Employees who separate from their employment prior to completing their probationary period are not entitled to termination pay. 
Civil service employees shall be subject to the same rules for termination pay as non-civil service employees except for the limits on accrued sick leave, which shall be calculated in accordance with the city's civil service rules. 
(j)  Performance evaluations. The city manager, or designee, is responsible for formulating and recommending a standard city employee evaluation form. Employees shall be evaluated by their immediate supervisor or department head on no less than an annual basis. 
(k)  Promotions, demotions and reassignment. In the case of all non-civil service employees, decisions on promotions, demotions and employee reassignments shall be based on an employee's skills, abilities, and previous performance evaluations. 
Promotions . 
Promotion will be considered after reviewing an employee's qualifications, previous work history, and demonstrated performance in his/her current position. Upon the written recommendation of the employee's department head and approval by the city manager, the promotion shall take effect as soon as is practical without undue disruption or interruption of departmental operations. 
Civil service employees shall not be eligible for promotion unless they meet the criteria set out in the city's civil service rules, as well as the eligibility criteria for fire department promotional examination and police department promotional examinations. 
The notice and procedure for promotional examination of civil service employees shall be governed by the city's civil service rules, as well as the determination of promotional examination grades. 
The procedure for making civil service promotional appointments and reviewing and appealing a promotional examination for civil service employees is governed the city's civil service rules. 
Demotion . 
In the case of non-civil service employees, a department head may make a written recommendation to the city manager for demotion of an employee under the department head's supervision or jurisdiction if the employee fails to satisfactorily meet the performance standards established for the position. 
Demotion of an employee shall be accomplished by a reduction in pay with a simultaneous reduction in duties and responsibilities. 
The demotion of civil service employees shall be governed by the city's civil service rules. 
Temporary duties in higher/lower classification . 
On occasion, employees may be assigned to work in a higher or lower classification on a temporary or interim basis due to personnel vacancies. In such case, the employee may be paid in accordance with the temporary or interim classification while performing the duties of that classification. 
Civil service employees may be appointed to a higher classification on a temporary basis when a vacancy exists. Such appointments shall be governed by the city's civil service rules. 
(Ord. No. 2018-27, § 1, 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 2-30. - Benefits and leave. 
(a)  Worker's compensation. The city maintains worker's compensation coverage for all employees, which covers the cost of medical care and regular income payments for employees who are injured or become ill in the course and scope of their employment. It is important that any workplace injury/illness, no matter how minor, be reported to the city timely and accurately. Failure to report an injury may affect an employee's eligibility to receive worker's compensation benefits, as well as delay the receipt of benefit payments. 
Providers . 
Employees who sustain a workplace or job-related injury/illness that requires medical attention must see a doctor within the city's worker's compensation insurance network. The injured employee may choose any doctor within the network. The city may not instruct an employee to see a specific doctor, but it can provide a list of the in-network doctors for an employee to choose from. 
If an injured employee chooses to be treated by an out-of-network doctor, the employee assumes the risk and responsibility of payment for the medical treatment and the potential loss of income benefits through the state workers' compensation system. 
Reporting procedure . 
In the event of any workplace injury/illness, the following steps should be taken: 
(1)  The employee should report the injury immediately to his/her supervisor, regardless of the extent of the injury. The supervisor shall be responsible for informing the department head and department of human resources of the employee's injury. 
(2)  The employee must comply with requests from the director of human resources and/or the workers' compensation insurance carrier pertaining to the administration of the claim. This shall include providing details relating to the injury (i.e. how the injury occurred, witnesses, what part of body was injured, location of where injury occurred, events that led up to the injury). 
(3)  If an employee is unable to work due to a workplace injury/illness, the employee shall report to his/her supervisor or department head, either in person or by telephone to report on his/her condition. 
(4)  While on leave due to a workplace injury/illness, employees must refrain from moonlighting activities or performing any other work for pay that would be inconsistent with or interfere with their recovery. 
(5)  Prior to returning to work, the injured employee must provide a written statement from an appropriate physician certifying the employee has been released to return to work and specifying the type(s) of work the employee is capable of performing, as well as any limitation(s). Employees will not be allowed to return to work without this documentation. 
Failure to comply with the provisions of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
Payment for first week of absence . 
To assist non-civil service employees who experience a workplace injury/illness resulting in lost time, the city will pay up to forty (40) hours of the first seven (7) calendar days of an employee's absence at the rate of two-thirds (?) the employee's regular rate of pay. In cases where an employee's absence due to a workplace injury/illness extends beyond the third week and the employee receives disability benefits from the city's worker's compensation insurance carrier retroactive to the first week of absence, the employee shall refund the amount paid by the city for the first week of disability via a payroll deduction. 
(b)  Insurance. 
Unemployment insurance . 
All employees are covered by unemployment insurance at the city's sole cost. 
Health, dental and life insurance . 
Regular, full-time city employees are eligible to participate in the city's health, dental and life insurance plans at the city's sole cost. Dependents may be covered under the city's health and dental insurance plans at an employee's expense. For information regarding the city's plans, employees should consult with the department of human resources. 
(c)  Retirement. The city participates in the federal Social Security program, which covers all employees. Additionally, all regular full-time City employees are required to participate in the city's retirement plan with the Texas Municipal Retirement System ("TMRS"), unless specifically excluded by law. Under the city's TMRS plan, five percent (5%) of an employee's gross compensation will be deposited to an employee's account and matched by the city on a 2-1 ratio. 
(d)  Educational reimbursement policy. 
Purpose . 
Subject to funding availability, the city may offer an educational reimbursement program to regular full-time employees who attend a course of study at a pre-approved institution or through an approved correspondence school. Educational reimbursement is intended to help employees maintain a satisfactory level of knowledge and expertise in their present position, as well as help them develop their skills and increase their potential for future advancement with the city. Employees participating in this educational reimbursement program shall not be permitted to attend courses during work hours unless authorized by the department head and approved by city manager, or designee. Additionally, employees attending courses under this educational reimbursement program shall not be compensated for their course work as hours of work. 
Scope . 
The course of study must be directly related to the employee's employment with the city (as determined by the employee's department head) and must be approved by the city manager, or designee, on the city's pre-approval form prior to registration. 
This benefit is intended to be used for tuition and textbooks and not for costs covered by state or federal educational assistance programs, or any incidental expenses such as supplies and/or other personal expenses. Employees will provide any additional documentation to the city upon request in order to be eligible to participate in this educational reimbursement program. 
Commitment of continued employment . 
Employees requesting educational reimbursement assistance must commit to continued employment with the city for a minimum period of two (2) years upon attaining a degree in the pre-approved course of study. Employees must acknowledge and agree that educational reimbursement assistance is a financial investment by the city and it is both reasonable and appropriate for the employee to reimburse the city subject to the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  One hundred percent (100%) if: 
a.  The employee fails to successfully attain said degree and/or vocational training/certification; 
b.  The employee makes a conscious decision to no longer pursue the degree and/or vocational training/certification; or 
c.  The employee separates from employment with the city prior to the one-year anniversary of the employee's graduation date. 
(2)  Fifty percent (50%) if the employee separates from employment prior to the two-year anniversary but after the one-year anniversary of the employee's graduation date. 
Responsibilities of the department head . 
Each department head must inform their department staff of this educational reimbursement policy prior to the new fiscal year in order to budget accordingly and determine the availability of funding. Employees must express their intent to request educational reimbursement assistance when the department head informs the staff about the policy and prior to the applicable fiscal year. 
Procedure . 
To be eligible to receive educational reimbursement assistance, employees must comply with the following procedures: 
(1)  Prior to registration, the employee must submit the following documents to the employee's department head for review and consideration: 
a.  The name of the college or institution the employee is attending; 
b.  The employee's degree and/or vocational training/certification plan or course of study; 
c.  The name and description of each course the employee intends to enroll in for the semester, including a brief summary of how the course relates to the employee's job; 
d.  The start and end date of the course; 
e.  The costs for tuition and/or books the employee expects to incur for the course; and 
f.  Any amount of state or federal educational assistance the employee will receive or has requested. 
(2)  The employee's department head will review and confirm the following information before approving a request for educational reimbursement and returning the pre-approval form to the employee: 
a.  The department head must ensure funding is available to support the reimbursement; 
b.  The department head must ensure the proposed course(s) is/are directly related to the employee's job; and 
c.  The department head shall provide a recommendation regarding approval of the request. 
(3)  If the department head approves the course(s), the employee must then submit the pre-approval form to the human resources department. The human resources department will review the employee's documentation for accuracy and will forward the pre-approval form to the city manager, or designee, for final determination. 
(4)  The human resources department is responsible for informing the employee (or department head) of the city manager's final determination on pre-approval of the courses and shall return the pre-approval form to the employee. 
(5)  Upon receipt of a final passing grade of "C" or better, the employee must submit the educational reimbursement request, grade report, and paid invoice to the human resources department within thirty (30) days. The city may reimburse an employee up to a maximum of three-thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per fiscal year for the cost of tuition, lab fees and books for pre-approved courses. 
(e)  Holidays. The city council will determine the official city holidays for each fiscal year. 
(f)  Vacation leave. All regular city employees shall be entitled to paid vacation leave at their regular rate of pay upon completion of each year of service. Eligible employees start earning vacation leave during the first year of employment but may not use any earned vacation leave until completing six (6) months of service. An employee's ninety (90) day probation period shall be included in computing the first year of service. 
A year for the purposes of computing vacation leave shall begin on the anniversary date of an employee's first day of employment, except as otherwise provided herein. 
Accrual schedule-Non-civil service employees: . 
(1)  Individuals who have been in the continuous employment of the city for a period of one (1) to four (4) years, inclusive, shall earn ten (10) days of vacation leave per year. 
(2)  Individuals who have been in the continuous employment of the city for a period of five (5) to nine (9) years, inclusive, shall earn twelve (12) days of vacation leave per year.

Accrual schedule-civil service personnel: . 
Civil service personnel shall earn fifteen (15) days of vacation leave per year, except that personnel with fifteen (15) years of service or more shall earn twenty (20) days of vacation leave per year. 
Use of vacation leave . 
(1)  Vacation leave credit shall not carry over from year to year. Any vacation leave credit earned that is not taken in the following year of service, shall be lost; provided, however, if it is in the best interests of the city, an employee may be required to forego previously scheduled vacation time with the understanding that such re-scheduled vacation time shall be taken as soon as practicable within the same or following year of service. 
(2)  Department heads and supervisors shall schedule employees' vacation leave in such a manner that shall not impair the efficient operations of the department. All employees must submit their request for vacation leave no later than ten (10) calendar days prior to the requested date(s) of vacation leave. 
(g)  Sick leave. All regular city employees are eligible for paid sick leave. Sick leave shall be earned but shall not be granted to any employee during the probationary period. 
Accrual schedule . 
(1)  Non-civil service employees shall earn eight (8) hours each month for a total of twelve (12) days per year. 
(2)  Civil service employees shall earn ten (10) hours each month for a total of fifteen (15) days per year. 
(3)  For non-civil service employees, sick leave accumulated over and above the maximum of two hundred forty (240) hours shall be placed in reserve for use in the event of a prolonged illness or may be cashed in at the end of each fiscal year at the rate of fifty percent (50%). However, any reserved hours will not be considered for termination pay purposes. 
(4)  Civil service employees shall accumulate sick leave and receive payments for accumulated sick leave in accordance with the Texas Local Government Code and City's Civil Service Rules. 
A year, for the purpose of computing paid sick leave, shall begin on the anniversary of the date the employee first began full-time employment. 
Procedure: . 
(1)  Sick leave shall be granted to an employee for personal illness, physical incapacity, or the illness, physical incapacity or funeral of an employee's immediate family member. An employee must notify and obtain the approval of his/her immediate supervisor or department head prior to taking sick leave. 
(2)  If an employee is absent for three (3) or more consecutive working days due to personal illness or the illness of an immediate family member, the employee's department head shall require a doctor's certificate before sick leave is approved. 
(3)  Sick leave shall be charged in increments of fifteen (15) minutes or 0.25 hours. When the use of sick leave is for an FMLA-qualifying event, the sick leave shall be charged concurrently with any available FMLA leave. 
Accumulation and substitution with other leave . 
(1)  If an employee has forty (40) hours of available sick leave, the employee may substitute some of their sick leave for personal leave, not to exceed sixteen (16) hours in a calendar year of employment. Firefighter employees may substitute up to twenty-four (24) hours of sick leave for personal leave during any calendar year of employment. 
(2)  Unused vacation time, including accrued, may be used in place of sick leave after all sick leave benefits and any available compensatory time have been exhausted during a prolonged illness. 
(3)  Occupational injury leave will generally not be counted against an employee's sick leave benefit unless the employee voluntarily elects to utilize any available paid sick leave prior to receiving temporary income benefits. An employee with available sick leave who is medically cleared to return to work following leave for an occupational injury must return to work before requesting to use sick leave. 
(h)  Occupational injury leave. Employees who suffer a workplace injury/illness that results in absence from work shall be granted unpaid leave for occupational injury. 
Leave for occupational injury shall run concurrently with any available leave under the FMLA to the extent the employee's workplace injury/illness qualifies as a "serious medical condition." While an employee is on leave due to occupational injury, the city shall continue the employee's health insurance benefits for the duration of available FMLA leave or paid leave, whichever is longer. Thereafter, an employee who remains on unpaid leave due to an occupational injury will be responsible for remitting the full amount of the employee benefit premium to the city, as well as the amount of any dependent benefit premium, for any period of unpaid leave. 
Return to work . 
Generally, an employee on occupational injury leave will only be allowed to return to work in his/her original position when a complete release from a medical provider is presented to the city. Failure to return to work following certification from a medical provider may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
The city does not normally have "light duty work" assignments. Therefore, if an employee has a medical form indicating the employee must only work in a "light duty" capacity, such work may not be available, and the employee may have to remain on leave until able to return to work without restrictions. If, however, "light duty work" is available, an employee placed on restrictions may be given the opportunity to perform such work if capable and qualified. In the case of employees whose workplace injury/illness qualifies as a "disability" under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the city will discuss any reasonable accommodations that may be available to allow the employee to return to work, to the extent the employee is able to perform the essential functions of his/her position. 
Termination proceedings . 
The city may initiate termination proceedings if a regular or part-time non-civil service employee who is injured or becomes ill in the scope of work is not able to return to work and/or perform the essential functions of his/her job after twelve (12) calendar weeks from the first day of lost time. 
Civil service employees . 
Civil service employees who are injured in the line of duty shall be entitled to up to one (1) year of paid leave from the date said employee was unable to work due to an injury or illness suffered in the line of duty, in accordance with the Texas Local Government Code and the city's Civil Service Rules. 
(i)  Leave for inclement weather. The city manager or a department head may grant employees leave due to inclement weather when said weather prevents the employee from performing his/her normal job duties. Such leave will be unpaid unless employees have accrued compensatory time or other paid leave if compensatory time is not available. Only the first two (2) hours of inclement weather leave will be paid to those employees who report to work and are subsequently ordered to leave. 
(j)  Civic leave. Absence from work due to service as a juror, attendance at court by summons, or a coroner's inquest as a witness shall be paid minus the amount of any fees received by an employee for such service to the extent the employee's wages exceed the amount earned for service. Employees are expected to return to work once the reason for the civic leave is completed. 
(k)  Military leave. Employees who are members of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, Reserves or Public Health Service will be granted a leave of absence for military service, training or related obligations in accordance with applicable law. Employees on military leave may substitute their accrued paid leave time for unpaid leave. At the conclusion of the leave, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, an employee generally has a right to return to the same position he or she held prior to the leave or to a position with like seniority, status and pay that the employee is qualified to perform. 
Leave for active or reserve duty . 
Upon receipt of orders for active or reserve duty, an employee should notify his/her supervisor and department head as soon as possible. The employee should also submit a copy of the military orders with the request for leave (unless he/she is unable to do so because of military necessity or it is otherwise impossible or unreasonable). 
Return from military leave . 
Upon return from military service, an employee must provide notice of or submit an application for reemployment in accordance with the following schedule: 
(1)  An employee who served for less than thirty-one (31) days or who reported for a fitness examination, must provide notice of reemployment at the beginning of the first full regular scheduled work period that starts at least eight (8) hours after the employee has returned from the location of service. 
(2)  An employee who served for more than thirty (30) days, but less than one hundred eighty-one (181) days must submit an application for reemployment no later than fourteen (14) days after completing his/her period of service, or, if this deadline is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the employee, then on the next calendar day when submission becomes possible. 
(3)  An employee who served for more than one hundred eighty (180) days must submit an application for reemployment no later than ninety (90) days after the completion of the uniformed service. 
(4)  An employee who has been hospitalized or is recovering from an injury or illness incurred or aggravated while serving must report to Human Resources (if the service was less than thirty-one (31) days) or submit an application for reemployment (if the service was greater than thirty (30) days), at the end of the necessary recovery period (but which may not exceed two (2) years). 
Required documentation . 
An employee whose military service was for more than thirty (30) days must provide documentation within two (2) weeks of his/her return (unless such documentation does not yet exist or is not readily available) showing the following: (i) the application for reemployment is timely (i.e. submitted within the required time period); (ii) the period of service has not exceeded five (5) years; and (iii) the employee's separation or dismissal from service was not disqualifying. 
Benefits . 
If military leave is less than thirty-one (31) days, benefits will continue without interruption. If an employee has military orders for more than thirty (30) days, the employee and covered dependents may elect to continue health and dental coverage for up to twenty-four (24) months under a COBRA-like plan. In such a case the employee will be responsible for remitting the full amount of the employee and dependent insurance benefit premium to the city. 
During any period of leave for which the employee is not receiving a paycheck from the city, the employee will be responsible for remitting the amount of the dependent benefit premium, if any, to the city. 
Military leave for state service . 
An employee who is a member of the Texas military forces, a reserve component of the armed forces, or a member of a state or federally authorized urban search and rescue team is entitled to a paid leave of absence from the employee's duties on a day on which the employee is engaged in authorized training or duty ordered or authorized by proper authority for not more than fifteen (15) workdays in a fiscal year. This paid military leave for state service shall be in addition to any other paid leave available to the employee. 
Employees requiring leave for state service shall schedule their leave and submit any supporting documentation to their supervisor and their department head. Employees requiring military leave for state service are entitled to return to the same job position held when ordered to training or duty and will not be subjected to loss of time, efficiency rating, vacation time, or any benefit of employment during or because of the absence. Employees should, as soon as practicable after release from duty, provide their supervisor and/or department head with written or actual notice of intent to return to employment. 
Employees on military leave for state service as described above shall be entitled to fifteen (15) working days of leave with pay. After the first fifteen (15) working days, employees may, at their option, use any or all paid vacation time or other leave during their absence until such accrued paid leave has been expended. 
Unused military leave for state service in a fiscal year cannot be carried over to a subsequent year. 
Civil service employees . 
Civil service employees may be granted a military leave of absence without pay to enable the individual to enter a branch of the United States military service. The leave of absence and reinstatement of employment shall be governed by the Texas Local Government Code, as referenced in the city's civil service rules. 
In addition, the city shall maintain military leave time accounts for the fire and police departments, with a separate military leave time account for each department, in accordance with the Texas Local Government Code, as referenced in the city's civil service rules. 
(l)  Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons during a twelve (12)-month period and requires group health benefits to be maintained during the leave as if employees continued to work instead of taking leave. Employees are also entitled to return to their same or an equivalent job at the end of their FMLA leave. The FMLA also provides certain military family leave entitlements. Eligible employees may take FMLA leave for specified reasons related to certain military deployments of their family members. Additionally, they may take up to twenty-six (26) weeks of FMLA leave in a single twelve (12)-month period to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness. 
Eligibility . 
To be eligible for leave under this policy an employee must have been employed with the city for at least twelve (12) months and must have worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during the twelve (12)-month period preceding the commencement of the leave. 
In determining FMLA eligibility, an employee re-employed following military service will be given credit for (i) the period of uniformed service towards the months-of-employment eligibility requirement, and (ii) the hours of service that would have been performed but for the period of uniformed service. 
FMLA leave may be taken for any one (1), or for a combination of, the following reasons: 
 The birth of the employee's child or to care for the newborn child; 
 The placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care or to care for the newly placed child; 
 To care for the employee's spouse, child or parent (but not in-law) with a serious health condition; and/or 
 The employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform one (1) or more of the essential functions of his or her job. 
 "active duty leave": the employee's responding or attending to a "qualifying exigency" arising out of a covered family member's active duty or notification of an impending call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces, including the National Guard or Reserves, in support of a contingency operation. A "covered family member" for purposes of this leave includes a spouse, son, daughter or parent of the employee; or 
 "Service member family leave": the employee's care of a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (nearest blood relative) who has incurred a serious illness or injury in the line of duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces, including the National Guard or Reserves, and that illness or injury has rendered the service member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member's office, grade, rank or rating. 
A "serious health condition" is an injury, illness, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider. 
A "qualifying exigency" may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, and attending post-deployment reintegration briefings. 
Twelve-month period . 
FMLA leave is not cumulative and cannot be "carried over" if not used. The city uses a "rolling" twelve-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. Under this method, each time an employee takes FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement would be any balance of the twelve (12) weeks, which has not been used during the immediately preceding twelve (12) months. For example, if an employee has taken eight (8) weeks of FMLA leave during the past twelve (12) months, an additional four (4) weeks of leave could be taken. If an employee used four (4) weeks beginning February 1, four (4) weeks beginning June 1, and four (4) weeks beginning December 1, the employee would not be entitled to any additional leave until February 1 of the following year. However, on February 1 of the following year, the employee would only be entitled to four (4) weeks of leave; on June 1 the employee would be entitled to an additional four (4) weeks, etc. 
Length of service member family leave . 
An eligible employee is entitled to a combined total of twenty-six (26) weeks of unpaid leave within a single twelve-month period for service member family leave. Leave to care for an injured or ill service member, whether or not combined with other FMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed twenty-six (26) weeks in a single twelve-month period. The amount of leave available to an employee will be calculated by looking backward at the amount of leave taken within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the first date of leave. If both a husband and wife are employed by the city, and are eligible for service member leave, the two (2) may take a combined total of twenty-six (26) weeks. Intermittent leave or a reduced schedule may be approved for service member family leave where medically necessary and where the need for such leave is best accommodated through such scheduling. An employee requesting intermittent leave/reduced schedule may be transferred temporarily to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits, or to a part-time position if such a position better accommodates the need for intermittent leave/reduced schedule. 
Service member family leave runs concurrent with other leave entitlements provided under federal, state, and local law. 
Limitations on FMLA Leave . 
Leave to care for a newborn or for a newly placed child must conclude within twelve (12) months after the birth or placement of the child. 
When both spouses are employed by the city, they are together entitled to a combined total of twelve (12) weeks of FMLA leave within the designated twelve-month period for the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child with the employees, for aftercare of the newborn or newly placed child, and to care for a parent (but not in-law) with a serious health condition. Each spouse may be entitled to additional FMLA leave for other FMLA qualifying reasons (i.e., the difference between the leave taken individually for any of the above reasons and twelve (12) weeks, but not more than a total of twelve (12) weeks per person). Any service member family leave, whether paid, unpaid, or a combination thereof, either taken by itself or together with any other family and medical leave and/or active duty leave, whether paid, unpaid or a combination thereof, will be counted toward the twenty-six-week leave entitlement. 
Intermittent or reduced work schedule leave . 
Intermittent leave is leave taken in separate blocks of time. A reduced work schedule leave is a leave schedule that reduces an employee's usual number of hours per work week or hours per workday. Leave to care for a newborn or for a newly placed child may not be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule unless the city agrees with respect to an individual leave request. 
If an employee takes leave intermittently or on a reduced work schedule basis, the employee must, when requested, attempt to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the city's operations. When an employee takes intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable planned medical treatment, the city may temporarily transfer the employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave. 
Requests for FMLA Leave . 
A request for FMLA leave must be on the appropriate form, signed by the employee, submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor for proper approval, and forwarded to the department of human resources. 
When leave is foreseeable for childbirth, placement of a child or planned medical treatment for the employee's or family member's serious health condition, the employee should provide his/her immediate supervisor and Human Resources with at least thirty (30) days advance notice, or such shorter notice as is practicable (i.e., within two (2) business days of learning of the need for the leave). When the timing of the leave is not foreseeable, the employee must provide the immediate supervisor with notice of the need for leave as soon as practicable (i.e., within two (2) business days of learning of the need for the leave). 
Required documentation . 
When leave is taken to care for a family member, the city may require the employee to provide documentation or statement of family relationship (e.g., birth certificate or court document). 
An employee may be required to submit medical certification from a health care provider to support a request for FMLA leave for the employee's or a family member's serious health condition. Medical certification forms are available from the department of human resources. 
If the city has reason to doubt the employee's initial certification, the city may: (i) with the employee's permission, contact the employee's health care provider in an effort to clarify or authenticate the initial certification; and/or (ii) require the employee to obtain a second opinion by an independent city-designated provider at the city's expense. If the initial and second certifications differ, the city may, at its expense, require the employee to obtain a third, final and binding certification from a jointly selected health care provider. 
During FMLA leave, the city may request that the employee provide recertification of a serious health condition at intervals in accordance with the FMLA. In addition, during FMLA leave, the employee must provide the city with periodic reports regarding the employee's status and intent to return to work. If the employee's anticipated return to work date changes and it becomes necessary for the employee to take more or less leave than originally anticipated, the employee must provide the city with reasonable notice of the employee's changed circumstances and new return to work date. If the employee gives the city notice of the employee's intent not to return to work, the employee will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. 
Before the employee returns to work from FMLA leave for the employee's own serious health condition, the employee may be required to submit a fitness for duty certification from the employee's health care provider, with respect to the condition for which the leave was taken, stating that the employee is able to resume work. 
FMLA leave or return to work may be delayed or denied if the appropriate documentation is not provided in a timely manner. Also, a failure to provide requested documentation of the reason for an absence from work may lead to termination of employment. 
Designation of leave . 
The city will notify the employee whether leave has been designated as FMLA leave. The city may provisionally designate an employee's leave as FMLA leave if the city has not received medical certification or has not otherwise been able to confirm that the employee's leave qualifies as FMLA leave. If the employee has not notified the city of the reason for the leave, and the employee desires that leave be counted as FMLA leave, the employee must notify the department of human resources within two (2) business days of the employee's return to work that the leave was for an FMLA reason. 
Use of paid and unpaid leave . 
FMLA provides eligible employees with up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave. If an employee has accrued paid leave (e.g., vacation, sick leave, compensatory time off), however, the employee must use any qualifying paid leave first. "Qualifying paid leave" is leave that would otherwise be available to the employee for the purpose for which the FMLA leave is taken. The remainder of the twelve (12) weeks of leave, if any, will be unpaid FMLA leave. Any paid leave used for an FMLA qualifying reason will be charged against an employee's entitlement to FMLA leave. This includes leave for disability or workers' compensation injury/illness, provided that the leave meets FMLA requirements. The substitution of paid leave for unpaid leave does not extend the twelve-week leave period (i.e. paid leave shall run concurrently with FMLA leave). 
Maintenance of health benefits . 
During FMLA leave an employee is entitled to continued group health plan coverage under the same conditions as if the employee had continued to work. To the extent that an employee's FMLA leave is paid, the employee's portion of insurance premiums will be deducted from the employee's salary. For the portion of FMLA leave that is unpaid, the employee's portion of insurance premiums may be paid on the same schedule as payments under COBRA. 
If the employee's payment of insurance premiums is more than thirty (30) days late, the city may discontinue insurance coverage upon notice to the employee. 
Return from FMLA Leave . 
Upon return from FMLA leave, the city will place the employee in the same position the employee held before the leave or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits and other employment terms. However, an employee is entitled to reinstatement only if he/she would have continued to be employed had FMLA leave not been taken. Thus, an employee is not entitled to reinstatement if, because of a layoff, reduction in force or other reason, the employee would not be employed at the time job restoration is sought. 
The city reserves the right to deny reinstatement to salaried, eligible employees who are among the highest paid ten (10) percent of city employees employed within seventy-five (75) miles of city hall ("key employees") if such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the city's operations. 
If an employee does not return to work following the conclusion of FMLA leave, the employee will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. The city may recover insurance premiums that the city paid on behalf of the employee during any unpaid FMLA leave; except the city's share of such premiums may not be recovered if the employee fails to return to work because of the employee's or a family member's serious health condition, or because of other circumstances beyond the employee's control. In such cases, the city may require the employee to provide medical certification of the employee's or the family member's serious health condition. Benefit entitlements based upon length of service will be calculated as of the last paid workday prior to the start of the unpaid leave of absence. 
Employees should contact the department of human resources for additional information or clarification about the city's FMLA leave policy. 
(m)  Authorized leave of absence. Upon application to the city manager, and at his/her discretion, all regular full-time employees are eligible to take an unpaid leave of absence of up to five (5) working days within a twenty-four-month period, if leave hours are unavailable. Any exceptions to this five-day limit shall be made on a case-by-case basis at the city manager's discretion and for emergency purposes only. Any authorized leave of absence must be approved in writing by the city manager before it can be taken. 
(n)  Unauthorized leave of absence. Any absence without permission of an employee's respective department head or supervisor will constitute an unauthorized leave of absence and shall be unpaid. Such instances shall subject an employee to discipline, up to and including termination, in accordance with these policies. 
Sec. 2-31. - Conduct in the workplace. 
(a)  Non-discrimination/non-harassment/non-retaliation policy. 
Statement of purpose .

Non-retaliation policy . 
This policy also prohibits any retaliatory action against anyone who has complained in good faith about discrimination or harassment in the workplace, has participated in an investigation, proceeding or lawsuit regarding an allegation of discrimination or harassment in the workplace, or who otherwise opposes employment practices the individual reasonably believes discriminate against individuals in violation of law.

Reporting complaints . 
Any employee who believes that he/she has been the subject of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, or has witnessed an incident of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, is encouraged to report it immediately, or as soon as practicable, to the complainant's immediate supervisor, department head or the human resources department. All persons that learn of an incident of discrimination, harassment or retaliation have a duty to report it to a supervisor, department head or the human resources department immediately. Supervisors and department heads must report incidents within twenty-four (24) hours to the human resources department. If an incident is reported to the human resources department, the human resources department will notify the respondent's (the accused employee) department head of only the name of the person being investigated; however additional detail can be provided at the conclusion of an investigation. 
Procedure for investigating complaints . 
The human resources department shall be responsible for coordinating and directing the investigation and review of complaints of discrimination, harassment or retaliation. The following procedures shall apply to the receipt, review, and handling of such complaints and are to be applied under the guidance and in consultation with the human resources department. 
1.  If an oral or written complaint is made to anyone other than the human resources department, the complaint shall be immediately referred to the human resources department for investigation. In most cases, the human resources department will be responsible for conducting the investigation, but the city may utilize an outside investigator or legal counsel to conduct investigations at its discretion. 
2.  The complainant will be asked to submit a written statement describing the incident(s) and details giving rise to the complaint. The complainant will also be interviewed regarding the allegations. If a complainant does not want to submit the complaint in writing, the human resources department will still investigate the complaint. 
3.  Following receipt of the complaint and interview of the complainant, the investigator will contact the respondent (the accused individual) regarding the complaint. If the respondent cannot be reached in-person or by telephone, a notice advising the respondent of the complaint will be mailed via certified mail to the most recent address noted in the respondent's personnel file. 
4.  The respondent will be interviewed regarding the allegations. Additionally, the respondent shall have five (5) business days to submit a response to the allegations. The respondent will also have the opportunity to respond to any other new information/allegations that may arise during the course of the investigation. 
5.  During the pendency of an investigation, the human resources department, with the city manager's approval, may place the respondent on leave with or without pay for a period not to exceed two (2) weeks (unless extended with approval of the city manager). A decision to place an employee on leave during the pendency of an investigation is not a disciplinary action, nor is it subject to the city's grievance procedures. If wrongdoing is not substantiated, an unpaid suspension will be paid. 
6.  In order to conduct a full investigation, the investigator retains the discretion to interview other witnesses and request signed statements from them. The investigator may also request evidence or documents from any of the interviewed parties that could possibly assist in the investigation. 
7.  Although all measures to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of the investigation will be taken, no person involved in the investigation process can be guaranteed absolute or strict confidentiality. 
8.  As soon as practicable following conclusion of the investigation, but not later than ten (10) business days, the investigator shall provide the human resources department and department head, or other designated individual, a conclusion regarding the validity of the complainant's allegations along with recommendations for action, if any. 
9.  The recommendation regarding any possible disciplinary action against any employee on account of an investigation into a complaint of discrimination, harassment or retaliation will be made by the department head in consultation with human resources department and/or the city attorney. The decision shall be rendered as soon as practicable, but not later than ten (10) business days from receipt of the investigator's conclusions. The human resources department and department head will notify the complainant and the respondent in writing of the results of the investigation, with copies to the city manager. 
i.  If the complainant's allegation is not substantiated, the investigation may be closed with no action against the respondent. If discrimination, harassment or retaliation did not occur, but other inappropriate behavior did occur, disciplinary or other action may be taken pursuant to the city's policies or city's civil service rules. 
ii.  If the complainant's allegation is substantiated, any of the following disciplinary actions may be taken, depending on the severity of the offense: 
 Counseling (documented in writing); 
 Transfer (the option to transfer the complainant may only be considered upon the complainant's request); 
 Suspension (without pay); or 
 Dismissal. 
iii.  If the investigation into a complainant's allegations proves inconclusive, the department head, in consultation with human resources department may recommend on any course of action that serves the best interest of the city, minimizes interference of divisional/departmental operations, and allows for the complainant and respondent to continue their work routines with minimal personal consequence. 
iv.  If the complainant's allegations are proven to have been made in bad faith, the complainant shall be disciplined appropriately. 
10.  A complainant may withdraw a complaint at any time. However, the city may still pursue an investigation and determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against any employee on account of the complaint. 
11.  In any instance where a member of the human resources department is the subject of a complaint of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, the same procedures shall apply except that the city manager will be responsible for receiving, reviewing and handling the complaint. The city manager shall have the authority to appoint a designee or outside investigator to conduct the investigation. 
12.  In any instance where the city manager, municipal court judge, alternate municipal court judge, city auditor or the city attorney is the subject of a complaint of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, the same procedures shall apply except that human resources department will be responsible for receiving, reviewing and handling the complaint, including the authority to appoint an outside investigator to conduct the investigation, and report findings and recommendations to city council. 
Appeals . 
Disciplinary actions taken against a complainant or respondent as a result of an investigation into a complaint of discrimination, harassment or retaliation may be appealed in accordance with city or civil service grievance procedures, as applicable. 
Ongoing duty to monitor and report. 
It is the ongoing responsibility of all department heads, supervisors and managers to monitor the employees in their areas of responsibility for inappropriate comments, displays or behavior and to take appropriate action by reminding their employees of the city's policies and reporting concerns and incidents to the human resources department. Upon learning of a possible incident of discrimination, harassment or retaliation in the workplace, supervisors should report the incident to human resources by no later than one (1) business day. 
Record keeping . 
All records concerning an investigation into a complaint of discrimination, harassment or retaliation shall be kept in a separate secure file in the human resources department. Access to an investigation file shall only be granted to parties who have a direct and relevant need for the information and only upon approval by the human resources department and/or legal counsel. Records concerning any subsequent disciplinary action against an employee as a result of an investigation shall be kept in the employee's regular personnel file. 
(b)  No-dating policy. In furtherance of the city's non-discrimination and non-harassment policy, supervisors, managers and department heads are prohibited from dating or engaging in any type of intimate or romantic relationship with subordinate employees. Such relationships can be disruptive to the workplace, create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict, and lead to charges of favoritism, discrimination or sexual harassment. The city reserves the right to take whatever action is appropriate, in its discretion, to protect the city's interest in promoting a fair, equitable and harassment-free workplace in the event of a violation of this policy. 
A "subordinate employee" is any employee under the authority and/or supervision of another individual within the city. 
Duty to Report . 
Any employee who becomes involved in an intimate or romantic relationship with any employee of management capacity within the employee's department must promptly notify his/her department head of the relationship within three (3) business days. In the case of a relationship with a department head, the employee shall notify the human resources department within three (3) business days. The department head will review the situation and take appropriate action where necessary in consultation with human resources, as approved by city manager. In the case of a relationship involving a department head, human resources shall consult with and seek the approval of the city manager prior to taking any appropriate action. Failure to disclose a relationship in violation of this provision could result in disciplinary action, including termination, pursuant to city policies or the city's civil service rules. 
Reassignment if available . 
Upon disclosure of a relationship between a supervisor and subordinate employee, the department head in consultation with human resources, and the approval of city manager, may decide to reassign one (1) or both employees to another position or department in the city to eliminate the conflict of interest. In the case of relationships involving a department head, human resources shall consult and obtain the approval of city manager before reassigning one (1) or both employees. Where reassignment is not an option, the employee in the supervisory or managerial position may be subject to termination pursuant to city policies or the city's civil service rules. 
Responsibility of professionalism . 
All employees involved in intimate or romantic relationships with other city employees, whether or not in contravention of this policy, have the duty to ensure they act professionally at all times and not engage in any conduct that interferes with their ability to perform their jobs or that could be deemed offensive to others. 
(c)  Workplace gossip policy. While the city respects the right of its employees to express their opinions and communicate with one (1) another regarding their employment and workplace environment, workplace gossip and/or spreading rumors about fellow employees that leads or would tend to cause disruptions in the workplace and/or damage interpersonal relationships may subject an employee to disciplinary action. 
(d)  Workplace bullying policy. The city is committed to providing all employees a healthy, safe and respectful work environment. To that end, the city is committed to the elimination of bullying in the workplace. Bullying behavior by any city employee, including supervisors, directors and executives, will not be tolerated. This policy applies during normal working hours, at work-related or sponsored functions, and while traveling on work-related business. Employees found in violation of this policy may be disciplined, up to and including termination pursuant to city policies or city's civil service rules. Retaliation against individuals who make a good faith report of bulling is strictly prohibited. 
Definitions . 
The city defines "bullying" as unwelcome or unreasonable behavior that demeans, intimidates or humiliates people either as individuals or as a group. Bullying behavior is often persistent and part of a pattern, but it can also occur as a single incident. It may be carried out by an individual or as a group. Some examples of bullying behavior are: 
1.  Verbal communication: 
 Abusive and offensive language; 
 Threats; 
 Insults; 
 Teasing; 
 Spreading rumor and innuendo; 
 Criticism that is not constructive or work-related; or 
 Trivializing of work and achievements. 
2.  Manipulating the work environment: 
 Isolating people from normal work interaction; 
 Excessive demands; 
 Setting impossible deadlines; or 
 Placing on least desired schedules. 
3.  Psychological manipulation: 
 Unfairly blaming for mistakes; 
 Setting people up for failure; 
 Deliberate exclusion; 
 Unjustified excessive supervision; 
 Practical jokes; 
 Belittling or disregarding opinions or suggestions; or 
 Criticizing in public. 
4.  Mobbing: 
 Mobbing is the bullying or social isolation of a person through collective unjustified accusations, humiliation, general harassment or emotional abuse. 
 Although it is group behavior, specific incidents such as an insult or a practical joke may be carried out by an individual as part of mobbing behavior. 
Responsibilities . 
All employees have a duty and responsibility to promptly report any incidents of bullying in the workplace to their immediate supervisor, department head or human resources department. If the report is submitted to the human resources department, the department head(s) must be notified. Context is important in understanding bullying, particularly verbal communication. While care should be exercised, it is better to make a good faith report of bullying than to let actual bullying go unreported. 
1.  Department heads and supervisors shall: 
 Ensure that all employees are aware of the city's anti-bullying policy; 
 Ensure that any incident of bullying is dealt with regardless of whether a complaint of bullying has been received orally or in writing; 
 Provide leadership and role-modeling in appropriate professional behavior; and 
 Respond promptly, sensitively and confidentially to all situations where bullying behavior is observed or alleged to have occurred. 
2.  Employees shall: 
 Familiarize themselves with and behave according to this policy; 
 Report incidents of bullying to your supervisor, department head or human resources director as appropriate; and 
 Where appropriate, speak to the alleged bully(ies) to object to the behavior. 
Reporting . 
Any employee who feels he or she has been a victim of bullying or witnessed an incident of bullying is encouraged to report the matter to his or her immediate supervisor, department head or the human resources department. Supervisors and department heads shall report all complaints of bullying, whether oral or written, to the human resources department. When appropriate, the human resources department may undertake an investigation in accordance with the process for investigating complaints of discrimination and harassment. Any disciplinary measures will be taken as necessary, pursuant to city policies or the city's civil service rules. 
(e)  Violence or threats in the workplace. Verbal threats of violence or threatening behavior in the workplace are strictly prohibited. Employees who violate this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination. Due to the serious nature of this offense, any comment will be taken seriously, and it shall not be an excuse that an employee intended the comment in a joking or harmless manner, or that the employee made such statement while angry. If an employee receives a threat or is treated in a hostile manner, the employee should not respond in kind, but rather should report the matter to the employee's supervisor, department head or human resources department. Responding in kind, except to legitimately defend yourself if in physical danger, is a violation of this policy and will result in discipline, up to and including termination. 
(Ord. No. 2018-27, § 1, 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 2-32. - Drugs and Alcohol in the Workplace. 
(a)  Overview. The city believes an alcohol and drug-free workplace promotes the safety, health and productivity of its employees. To achieve this goal, all employees are required to report to work in an appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory and safe manner. 
Prohibited conduct . 
No City employee may use, possess, distribute, sell, purchase or be under the influence of alcohol (except under the limited circumstances described below), inhalants, illegal drugs, including drugs which are legally obtainable but which were not legally obtained, and prescribed or over-the-counter drugs that are not being used as prescribed or as intended by the manufacturer, while performing work for the city. 
This prohibition also extends to the use, possession, distribution, purchase or sale of drug-related paraphernalia while performing work for the city. Drug-related paraphernalia includes material and/or equipment designed for use in testing, packaging, storing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing illegal or unauthorized drugs into the body. 
Scope . 
For purposes of this policy, the term "performing work for the city" includes all employee activity occurring while on city premises; while on duty; while conducting city-related business or other activities off premises; while driving a city-owned or leased vehicle; or while operating or using other city-owned or leased property or equipment. 
Off-duty conduct . 
The city reserves the right to take disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against any city employee if the employee's off-duty use of or involvement with drugs or alcohol is damaging to the city's reputation or business, is inconsistent with the employee's job duties, or when such off-duty use or involvement adversely affects the employee's job performance. 
Exceptions . 
The following limited exceptions shall not constitute a violation of this policy: 
1.  Employees who are conducting city business, including city-related business entertainment outside normal city business hours may consume alcohol without violating this policy, subject to the following limitations: 
i.  Any consumption of alcohol by a city employee during a business lunch is strictly prohibited. 
ii.  No city employee may drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. 
iii.  No city employee serving in their work-related capacity should ever be impaired due to an excessive consumption of alcohol. 
2.  Employees may only bring alcoholic beverages onto city premises, including parking lots adjacent to city work areas, upon the express and specific approval of the city manager. City employees are prohibited from storing or transporting alcoholic beverages in a city-owned or leased vehicle unless it occurs in connection with a city-sponsored event and is approved by the city manager. 
3.  Employees who use or possess a drug authorized by and in the manner prescribed by a licensed physician through a prescription specifically for that employee's use, or in accordance with the terms of use for over-the-counter drugs, and who notifies his/her supervisor of any effects such use may have on the employee's work performance, will not be considered to have violated this policy. 
4.  Police department employees, and other safety employees, who come in possession of alcohol and/or drugs in carrying out their job duties shall not be considered to have violated this policy. 
5.  Employees who are not scheduled to be "on call," but are nonetheless called upon to report to work, may notify their supervisor of an inability to report to work when reporting to duty would constitute a violation of this policy. In such case, the employee will not be required to report to duty. However, employees who are scheduled to be "on call" and are called out for service are governed by this policy and will be expected to report to work in a fit and satisfactory manner. 
Violations . 
Employees who violate this drug and alcohol use policy will be subject to disciplinary action. In determining what disciplinary action to take, the city may consider the seriousness of the infraction, the past record of the employee, and the circumstances surrounding the matter. 
Treatment programs and employee insurance . 
While the city does not sponsor or endorse any specific drug or alcohol treatment programs, such programs are available through public and private health care facilities in our area. Affected employees are encouraged to seek assistance for themselves and their dependents. 
(b)  Drug testing for non-DOT employees. Employees who are hired to positions that are not "safety sensitive" or otherwise subject to regulations by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") shall be subject to the following conditions for drug testing during their employment: 
1.  Pre-employment : All applicants for employment must pass a drug test before beginning work or receiving an offer of employment. Refusal to submit to testing will result in disqualification of further employment consideration. 
2.  Reasonable suspicion : Employees are subject to testing based on (but not limited to) observations of apparent workplace use, possession or impairment due to drugs or alcohol. The city manager, or designee, should be consulted before an employee is tested based on a reasonable suspicion. Any supervisor or other managerial employee who refers an employee for testing based on reasonable suspicion must document in writing the specific factors that support the referral for testing (i.e. details of the employee's behavior and symptoms, statements from other employees or third-party witnesses, and other evidence supporting the suspicion). If the results of those observations and behaviors indicate further action is justified, the city manager or department head should confront the employee with the documentation. 
3.  Post-accident : Employees are subject to testing when they cause or contribute to accidents that: 
(i)  Seriously damage a city vehicle, machinery, equipment or property; or (ii) result in an injury to themselves or another employee. An employee may also be subject to testing in the case of a "near miss" accident. In any of these instances, the investigation and subsequent testing must occur within two (2) hours following the accident, if not as soon as practicable. 
4.  Treatment or rehabilitation program : Employees may be tested for drugs or alcohol in connection with any required treatment or rehabilitation program for substance abuse. 
Testing procedure . 
All drug or alcohol testing shall be paid by the city and when possible, shall occur during the employee's normal working hours. Testing may include one (1) or more of the following types of tests: urinalysis, hair testing, breathalyzer, intoxilyzer, blood, or any other generally-accepted testing procedure. 
1.  Department heads must obtain the approval of the city manager, or designee, prior to submitting an employee for drug or alcohol testing. If the city manager, or designee, is unavailable within a reasonable period of time, the department head may authorize the testing in his/her sole discretion. When testing is based on a "reasonable suspicion," no testing may be authorized until the employee's supervisor has documented the articulable factors supporting the reasonable suspicion. 
2.  In the case of a workplace injury, accident or "near miss," or when a reasonable suspicion exists that an employee has violated this policy, the city shall provide the employee with transportation to the testing facility and his/her return home following the testing. The employee's supervisor, or another city representative, will stay with the employee until the testing is complete. 
3.  All testing will be performed by an approved laboratory or healthcare provider, as selected by the city. Any positive test results may be subject to confirmation testing. 
4.  Employees will be paid for time spent in alcohol or drug testing and then suspended with pay, or assigned to alternate duty if available, pending the results of the drug or alcohol test. After the results of the test are received, a date and time will be scheduled to discuss the results of the test. This meeting will include the employee's department head. If the results are negative, the employee will receive back pay for the times/days of suspension. 
5.  A positive test result constitutes a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Any employee who is terminated for violating this policy is not eligible for future re-employment with the city. 
6.  Any employee who refuses to be tested, or who attempts to alter or tamper with a sample or any part of the testing process will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
(c)  Drug testing for employees subject to DOT regulations. All employees subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") are required to submit to drug and alcohol tests as a condition of employment in accordance with the federal regulations found in 49 CFR Part 382, as amended, and 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. Copies of Parts 382 and 40 can be obtained from the human resources department (the drug and alcohol program manager) and can be found on the Internet at the Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Drug and Alcohol Policy and Compliance website. 
Covered employees . 
Per federal regulations, every employee whose position requires the possession of a commercial driver's license (CDL) or the performance of "safety-sensitive functions," including applicants for such positions, are "covered employees" subject to DOT testing requirements. 
Safety-sensitive functions include, but are not limited to: 
 Driving a commercial motor vehicle which requires the driver to have a CDL; 
 Waiting to be dispatched to operate a commercial motor vehicle; 
 Inspecting, servicing, or conditioning any commercial motor vehicle; 
 Performing all other functions in or upon a commercial motor vehicle (except resting in a sleeper berth); 
 Loading or unloading a commercial motor vehicle, supervising or assisting in the loading or unloading, attending a vehicle being loaded or unloading, remaining in readiness to operate the vehicle, or giving or receiving receipts for shipments being loaded or unloaded; 
 Repairing, obtaining assistance, or remaining in attendance upon a disabled vehicle 
Prohibited behavior . 
Use of illegal drugs is prohibited at all times. All covered employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty any time there is a quantifiable presence of a prohibited drug in the body at or above the minimum thresholds defined in Part 40. Prohibited drugs include: 
(e)  Marijuana; 
(f)  Cocaine; 
(g)  Phencyclidine (PCP); 
(h)  Opioids; 
(i)  Amphetamines. 
All covered employees are prohibited from performing or continuing to perform safety-sensitive functions while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. 
All covered employees are prohibited from consuming alcohol while performing safety-sensitive job functions or while on-call to perform safety-sensitive job functions. If an on-call employee has consumed alcohol, they must acknowledge the use of alcohol at the time that they are called to report for duty. If the on-call employee claims the ability to perform his or her safety-sensitive function, he or she must take an alcohol test with a result of less than 0.02 prior to performance. 
All covered employees are prohibited from consuming alcohol within four (4) hours prior to the performance of safety-sensitive job functions. 
All covered employees are prohibited from consuming alcohol for eight (8) hours following involvement in an accident or until he or she submits to the post-accident drug and alcohol test, whichever occurs first. 
Circumstances for testing . 
1.  Pre-employment. A negative pre-employment drug test result is required before an employee can first perform safety-sensitive functions. If a pre-employment test is cancelled, the individual will be required to undergo another test and successfully pass with a verified negative result before performing safety-sensitive functions. 
a.  If a covered employee has not performed a safety-sensitive function for 90 or more consecutive calendar days and has not been in the random testing pool during that time, the employee must take and pass a pre-employment test before he or she can return to a safety-sensitive function. 
b.  A covered employee or applicant who has previously failed or refused a DOT pre-employment drug test must provide proof of having successfully completed a referral, evaluation, and treatment plan meeting DOT requirements. 
c.  Exceptions: A driver is not required to undergo a pre-employment test if: (i) the driver has participated in a DOT testing program within the previous thirty (30) days and while participating in that program, was either drug tested within the past six (6) months (from the date of application with the city), or participated in the random drug testing program for the previous twelve (12) months (from the date of application with city); and (ii) the city can ensure that no prior employer of the driver of whom the city has knowledge has records of a violation of this part or the controlled substances use rule of another DOT agency within the previous six (6) months. 
2.  Reasonable suspicion testing. All covered employees shall be subject to a drug and/or alcohol test when the city has reasonable suspicion to believe that the covered employee has used a prohibited drug and/or engaged in alcohol misuse. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing will be made by a trained supervisor or other trained city official on the basis of specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the covered employee. 
a.  Covered employees may be subject to reasonable suspicion drug testing any time while on duty. 
b.  Covered employees may be subject to reasonable suspicion alcohol testing while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions. 
3.  Post-accident testing. Covered employees shall be subject to post-accident drug and alcohol testing under the following circumstances: 
a.  Fatal accidents: As soon as practicable following an occurrence involving a commercial motor vehicle operating on a public road in commerce and involving the loss of a human life. Drug and alcohol tests will be conducted on each surviving covered employee who was performing safety-sensitive functions with respect to the vehicle. 
b.  Non-fatal accidents: As soon as practicable following an occurrence involving a commercial motor vehicle operating on a public road in commerce, and not involving the loss of a human life. 
i.  An alcohol test will be conducted on each driver who receives a citation within eight (8) hours of the occurrence under state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident, if: (A) the accident results in injuries requiring immediate medical treatment away from the scene; or (B) one (1) or more motor vehicles incur disabling damage and must be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor vehicle. 
ii.  A drug test will be conducted on each driver who receives a citation within thirty-two (32) hours of the occurrence under state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident, if: (A) the accident results in injuries requiring immediate medical treatment away from the scene; or (B) one (1) or more motor vehicles incur disabling damage and must be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor vehicle. 
    A covered employee subject to post-accident testing must remain readily available, or it is considered a refusal to test. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for the injured following an accident or to prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care. 
4.  Random testing. Random drug and alcohol tests are unannounced and unpredictable, and the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Random testing will be conducted at all times of the day when safety-sensitive functions are performed. 
a.  Testing rates will meet or exceed the minimum annual percentage rate set each year within each DOT agency. If a given driver is subject to random testing under the rules of more than one (1) DOT agency, the driver will be subject to random drug and alcohol testing at the annual percentage rate established by the DOT agency regulating more than fifty percent (50%) of the driver's function. 
b.  The selection of employees for random drug and alcohol testing will be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator. Under the selection process used, each covered employee will have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. 
c.  A covered employee may only be randomly tested for alcohol misuse while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions. A covered employee may be randomly tested for prohibited drug use anytime while on duty. 
d.  Each covered employee who is notified of selection for random drug or random alcohol testing must immediately proceed to the designated testing site. 
5.  Return to duty testing. Any employee who is allowed to return to safety-sensitive duty after failing or refusing to submit to a DOT drug and/or alcohol test must first be evaluated by a substance abuse professional (SAP), complete a SAP-required program of education and/or treatment, and provide a negative return-to-duty drug and/or alcohol test result. All tests will be conducted in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
6.  Follow-up testing. Employees returning to safety-sensitive duty following leave for substance abuse rehabilitation will be required to undergo unannounced follow-up alcohol and/or drug testing for a period of one (1) to five (5) years, as directed by the SAP. The duration of testing will be extended to account for any subsequent leaves of absence, as necessary. The type (drug and/or alcohol), number, and frequency of such follow-up testing shall be directed by the SAP. All testing will be conducted in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
Testing procedures . 
All drug and alcohol testing will be conducted in accordance with applicable federal regulations, as amended. 
1.  Dilute urine specimen. If there is a negative dilute test result, the city will accept the test result and there will be no retest, unless the creatinine concentration of a negative dilute specimen was greater than or equal to two (2) mg/dL, but less than or equal to five (5) mg/dL. Dilute negative results with a creatinine level greater than or equal to two (2) mg/dL but less than or equal to five (5) mg/dL require an immediate recollection under direct observation. 
2.  Split specimen test. In the event of a verified positive test result, or a verified adulterated or substituted result, the employee can request that the split specimen be tested at a second laboratory, at the employee's own cost. The city guarantees that the split specimen test will be conducted in a timely fashion. 
Test refusals . 
The following situations will be deemed a "refusal to test": 
1.  Failure to appear for any test (except a pre-employment test) within a reasonable time, as determined by the city. 
2.  Failure to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete. An employee who leaves the testing site before the testing process commences for a pre-employment test has not refused to test. 
3.  Failure to attempt to provide a breath or urine specimen. An employee who does not provide a urine or breath specimen because he or she has left the testing site before the testing process commenced for a pre-employment test has not refused to test. 
4.  In the case of a directly-observed or monitored urine drug collection, failure to permit monitoring or observation of your provision of a specimen. 
5.  Failure to provide a sufficient quantity of urine or breath without a valid medical explanation. 
6.  Failure or declining to take a second test as directed by the collector or the city for drug testing. 
7.  Failure to undergo a medical evaluation as required by the MRO or the city's designated employer representative (DER). 
8.  Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process. 
9.  Failure to follow an observer's instructions to raise and lower clothing and turn around during a directly-observed test. 
10.  Possessing or wearing a prosthetic or other device used to tamper with the collection process. 
11.  Admitting to the adulteration or substitution of a specimen to the collector or MRO. 
12.  Refusing to sign the certification at Step 2 of the alcohol testing form (ATF). 
13.  Failure to remain readily available following an accident. 
As a covered employee, if the MRO reports that you have a verified adulterated or substituted test result, you have refused to take a drug test. 
Consequences for violations . 
Following a positive drug or alcohol (BAC at or above 0.04) test result or test refusal, the employee will be immediately removed from safety-sensitive duty and referred to a substance abuse professional (SAP). 
Following a BAC of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, the employee will be immediately removed from safety-sensitive duties until the start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 24 hours following administration of the test. Employees with a positive drug or alcohol test result, or who refuse to submit to testing, will be subject to discipline up to and including termination. 
If an employee decides to enroll in a rehabilitation program following a positive test result for drugs or alcohol, the employee shall be responsible for the cost of such program. Employees shall be entitled to utilize any available paid leave for the purpose of participating in a rehabilitation program. The city may grant employees unpaid leave to participate in a rehabilitation program at its discretion. 
Voluntary self-referral . 
Any covered employee who has a drug and/or alcohol abuse problem and has not been selected for reasonable suspicion, random or post-accident testing or has not refused a drug or alcohol test may voluntarily refer her or himself to the city administrator, who will refer the individual to a substance abuse counselor for evaluation and treatment. 
The substance abuse counselor will evaluate the employee and make a specific recommendation regarding the appropriate treatment. Employees are encouraged to voluntarily seek professional substance abuse assistance before any substance use or dependence affects job performance. 
Any safety-sensitive employee who admits to a drug and/or alcohol problem will immediately be removed from his/her safety-sensitive function until successful completion of a prescribed rehabilitation program. Prior to participating in a safety-sensitive function, the employee must also undergo a DOT return-to-duty drug test with a verified negative result and/or a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. 
(d)  Confidentiality. All drug and alcohol test results shall be maintained in a confidential file, separate and apart from the employee's regular personnel file. Any medical-related information will be confidential and accessible only to parties who have a direct and relevant need for the information and only upon approval by the human resources department. 
(e)  Inspections. The city reserves the right to inspect all portions of its premises for drugs, alcohol or other contraband, upon reasonable suspicion of a violation of this policy or in the case of a "special need" for individuals in safety-sensitive positions. All employees, contract employees and visitors may be asked to cooperate in inspections of their persons, work areas and property that might conceal a drug, alcohol or other contraband. Employees who possess such contraband or refuse to cooperate in such inspections may be subject to appropriate discipline, up to and including termination. 
(Ord. No. 2018-27, § 1, 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 2-33. - Use of city equipment and facilities. 
(a)  Computer and city communications systems. 
General policy . 
This policy is intended to promote the responsible and appropriate use of the city's computer equipment, computer networks and electronic communications systems ("ECS") (most notably the Internet, voicemail, electronic mail and fax machines). The city will hold all employees responsible for their actions in accessing or using the city's computers, networks and ECS. 
City computers, networks and ECS must be used for business-related purposes only. Access and use of the city's computers, networks and ECS is a privilege; not a right. Department heads, or their designees, will authorize the level of access necessary for an employee to perform his/her job. 
City property and public information . 
All computers and related components and peripherals, including all other ECS equipment, are the property of the city. All computer files (regardless of their physical location or form) and email originated, received, and/or otherwise handled by the city's ECS, are also considered city property. Employees should have no expectation of privacy in anything they create, store, send or receive using the city's computers, networks and ECS property. 
The city reserves the right to access and disclose all messages and other electronic data, sent over its electronic mail system or stored in its computer files, for legal and audit purposes. Under the Texas Public Information Act, any electronic mail or computer file can be a public record. Employees should be aware that electronic records are subject to the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the Texas Public Information Act, subject to the exceptions under the Act. 
The city has the capability to access, review, copy or delete information prepared on, stored on, or in any other manner or status maintained on computer equipment, computer software or computer discs, notwithstanding the use of passwords, "fire walls" or other measures intended to protect the security or confidentiality of the information. The city reserves the right to access, review, copy, or delete all such information, including such information to any third party, inside or outside the city, as it deems appropriate and in accordance with any applicable laws. 
Use of computer equipment and software . 
Computer equipment and computer software provided by the city is for legitimate business use only. Use of city computer equipment or software for personal use must be authorized by a department head. Employees are also absolutely prohibited from copying, storing, distributing, downloading or installing software, or any other copyrighted software (which is illegal) onto city computers. Employees may not agree to a license or download any material for which a registration or other fee is required before obtaining written permission from their department head. Employees are prohibited from using a computer beyond the restriction of software access licenses and usage agreements. Employees should not knowingly disseminate a computer virus, nor install personal software of any kind (including disks or USB ports brought from home) onto a city computer. Information Technology (IT) staff, or their designees, are the only employees authorized to install software on city computers. 
Employees are responsible for the professional, ethical and lawful use of the city's computer system. In all instances, employees must maintain their personal computers in a clean environment and protect against dust, beverages, food or other substances and materials that might damage such equipment or create a safety hazard. Employees are expected to report any suspected violations of this policy, flaws in securities, or other deficiencies in the city's computer systems to IT and a member of management in their respective department. 
As a safeguard to the city, and those employees having access to the city's computer equipment, it is suggested that back-ups of all computer files be performed on a daily basis if feasible. If not, the city strongly recommends that back-up be performed at least once a week (e.g., every Friday). This recommendation is to protect against the possible loss of data files in case the employees' computer is damaged for some unexpected reason(s). 
Unauthorized uses . 
The city's computers and networks shall not be used to: 
1.  Seek or gain unauthorized access to the city's network resources or Internet; 
2.  Conduct or participate in any actions that are illegal, including but not limited to viewing, displaying, transmitting, or receiving any sexually-explicit, discriminatory, harassing or threatening material; 
3.  Conduct, promote or transmit commercial or private/personal business enterprises, political lobbying, product advertisement or unsolicited commercial information (i.e. junk mail, advertising, etc.); 
4.  Destroy the integrity of the city's computer-based information or compromise the privacy and/or security of users; 
5.  Disrupt the functions of the city's networks or other computer resources, including but not limited to the propagation of worms, viruses or other debilitating programs; 
6.  Circumvent legal protection provided by program and data copyright and licenses. 
Internet access and use . 
The Internet is a world-wide network of computers that contains millions of pages of information. Users are cautioned that many of these pages include offensive, sexually-explicit and obnoxious material. Even innocuous research requests may lead to sites with highly offensive content. Users accessing the Internet do so at their own risk and the city is not responsible for material viewed or downloaded by the user from the Internet. Additionally, having an e-mail address on the Internet may lead to receipt of similar unsolicited offensive content. Last but not least, other ECS, such as telephone, voice mail and/or faxes might be used for similar purposes. 
To ensure security and avoid the spread of viruses, users accessing the Internet via the city's network must go through the city's Internet firewall. Bypassing the city's network security by accessing the Internet directly by modem or other means is strictly prohibited. Users should never download files from the Internet, accept e-mail attachments from outsiders, or use disks/USBs from non-city sources without first scanning the material with the city-provided virus checking software. Any employee who suspects a virus has been introduced into the city's network shall notify IT staff and a member of management in the employee's department, immediately. 
Employees should use the Internet for work-related purposes and in a responsible, effective and lawful manner. Access to and use of the Internet is not confidential, and the city will monitor an employee's Internet access and use. The following rules and guidelines shall be strictly adhered to: 
1.  Uses that interfere with normal business activities, such as solicitation, for-profit business activities, soliciting money for religious and/or political causes, and/or activities that could potentially embarrass the city are strictly forbidden. 
2.  Employees shall not use the Internet to access, transmit or download material that is offensive, obscene, pornographic, threatening, discriminatory or harassing. 
3.  Employees shall not use the Internet to disseminate or print copyrighted materials (including articles and software) in violation of copyright laws. It is the employee's responsibility to check for copyright or licensing agreements when downloading files. 
4.  Employees shall not use the Internet to provide access to confidential information or to provide access to public information without following the city's rules and procedures for such dissemination. 
5.  Employees shall not use an Internet service account other than the one assigned by the city's IT personnel. Personal or employee web pages and web sites are not permitted on the city's system. 
6.  Employees shall not use the Internet for personal use during working hours, (e.g. online shopping, personal information research, online college enrollment, classes, or exams, etc.). 
The city may allow use of the Internet for personal reasons if such use is reasonable, does not interfere with an employee's work, and does not occur during working hours. Internet usage is subject to limitations as imposed by supervisors to prevent excessive or improper use. 
Access and use of e-mail . 
E-mail is a business communication tool to be used in a responsible, ethical, professional and lawful manner. All messages distributed via the city's e-mail system, including personal e-mails, are the property of the city. Although by its nature, e-mail seems to be less formal than other written communication, the same laws apply. Therefore, it is important that users are aware of the legal risks of e-mail: 
1.  If you send or forward e-mails with any libelous, defamatory, offensive, racist or obscene remarks, you and the city can be held liable. 
2.  If you unlawfully forward confidential information, you and the city can be held liable. 
3.  If you unlawfully forward or copy messages without permission, you and the city can be held liable for copyright infringement. 
4.  If you send an attachment that contains a virus, you and the city can be held liable. 
Employees are responsible for all e-mail messages originating from their user ID. Users must take the same care in drafting an e-mail as they would for any other communication. Employees shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to prevent the inadvertent dissemination of protected personal or confidential information, either of the city or of other individuals. 
Employees who have been provided e-mail accounts have an obligation to read in-coming messages in a timely manner and respond accordingly. Employees must unsubscribe to all mailing lists when their account addresses change, or when they leave city employment. 
Employees are strictly prohibited from: . 
1.  Sending or forwarding e-mails containing libelous, defamatory, offensive, racist or obscene remarks. Any unsolicited electronic correspondence received should be disposed of accordingly. If an employee repeatedly receives correspondence of this nature, the employee must promptly notify his/her supervisor. 
2.  Reading, deleting, copying, modifying or forwarding a message or attachment belonging to another user without acquiring permission from the originator first. 
3.  Sending unsolicited e-mail messages, chain mail or any messages that may create a hostile work environment such as sending harassing, discriminating, and/or other threatening e-mail to another user. 
4.  Forging or attempting to forge e-mail messages or disguising or attempting to disguise your identity when sending mail. 
5.  Supporting or soliciting on behalf of groups, organizations, etc. that are not related to the city or distributing personal messages, junk mail, jokes and executables that interfere with the work of others. 
6.  Transmitting, receiving, or viewing pornographic or sexually-explicit messages, cartoons, images or sounds, or anything else that may be construed as unlawful harassment or disparagement of others. 
7.  Sending or receiving downloaded music, copyrighted materials, confidential information, or city financial information without following appropriate procedures and authorization. 
Employees should assume that copies (back-up copies or otherwise) of email messages and other electronic correspondence may exist on other systems even though the sender and recipient have discarded their copies of the document. 
Telephone, cell phone and fax use . 
Telephones (including cell phones) are to be used primarily for city business. However, the city allows employees to use its telephone system for personal use on a reasonable basis. Employees should limit themselves to short personal calls during regularly business hours. Excessive personal use of this privilege during working hours, regardless of whether it's a city-owned phone or personal cell phone, shall be subject to disciplinary measures deemed appropriate by the department head or immediate supervisor. No calls resulting in fees to the city are permitted. 
Use of the city's fax machines is for city business only; unless otherwise explicitly approved by an employee's department head under the same rules for use of the telephone system stated above. 
The city reserves the right to monitor the use of its telephone and fax systems (when appropriate) for quality control purposes and to ensure that communication standards are being followed. Employees shall have no expectation of privacy in their use of the city's telephone and fax systems. 
Employees are strictly prohibited from using the city's telephone or fax systems to: 
1.  Transmit libelous, slanderous, or sexually-explicit verbal or text messages, cartoons, images or sounds, or anything else that may be construed as unlawful harassment or disparagement of others. 
2.  Conduct or participate in any actions that are illegal, including but not limited to terroristic calls or threats, harassing, discriminatory and/or offensive slurs, obscene remarks, and/or other threatening calls or faxed messages. 
3.  Solicit or promote commercial ventures, religious or political causes on behalf of any group, organization, individual, or an employee's personal interests. 
4.  Make or distribute anonymous telephone calls or fax messages, including offensive jokes and/or other matters that may offend or interfere with the work of others, or violate any city policy, ordinance, state or federal law. 
Violations . 
Any employee who violates, participates, or has knowledge of a violation of this section and fails to report such violation may be subject to cancellation of the privilege to use the city's computers, networks and ECS. In addition, employees may incur personal liability for any costs the city incurs as a result of an employee's violation of this section. Finally, any violation of this section may subject an employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
(b)  Mail. Employees should not direct any personal mail or packages to city hall or other city offices, nor may they use city stationery or postage for personal purposes.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 06-22, § 1(parts A-K), adopted Sept. 5, 2006, repealed the former Div. 2 in its entirety and added a new Div. 2 to read as herein set out. Former Div. 2, §§ 2-211-2-217, pertained to ethics review commission, and derived from Ord. No. 97-38, §§ 2-8, adopted Dec. 2, 1997; Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, adopted April 22, 1998. At the editor's discretion, inasmuch as the provisions of Ord. No. 06-22 superseded Div. 3, §§ 2-231-2-234, said division has been repealed. Former Div. 3 pertained to code of ethics and derived from Ord. No. 97-38, §§ 9-12, adopted Dec. 2, 1997. 

Subdivision A. - Declaration of Policy 

Sec. 2-211. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is essential in a democratic system that the public have confidence in the integrity, independence, and impartiality of those who act on their behalf in government. Such confidence depends not only on the conduct of those who exercise official power, but on the availability of aid or redress to all persons on equal terms and on the accessibility and dissemination of information relating to the conduct of public affairs. For the purpose of promoting confidence in the government of the City of Eagle Pass, and thereby enhancing the city's ability to function effectively, this code of ethics is adopted. The code establishes standards of conduct, disclosure requirements, and enforcement mechanisms relating to city officials and employees and others whose actions inevitably affect public faith in city government, such as former city officials and employees, candidates for public office, persons doing business with the city, and lobbyists. By prohibiting conduct incompatible with the city's best interests and minimizing the risk of any appearance of impropriety, this code of ethics will further the legitimate interests of democracy. 
(Ord. No. 06-22, § 1(part A, § 1), 9-5-2006) 
Sec. 2-212. - Definitions. 
    As used in this code of ethics, the following words and phrases have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, unless the context requires otherwise or more specific definitions set forth elsewhere in this code apply: 
    Acceptance. "Acceptance" of an offer of subsequent employment or business opportunities includes legally binding contracts and all informal understandings that the parties expect to be carried out. 
    Affiliated. Business entities are "affiliated" if one is the parent or subsidiary of the other or if they are subsidiaries of the same parent business entity. 
    Affinity. Relationship by "affinity" is defined in Section 573.024 and 573.025 of the Texas Government Code, as amended. 
    Before the city. Representation or appearance "before the city" means before the city council; before a board, commission, or other city entity; or before a city official or employee. 
    Benefit. "Benefit" means anything reasonably regarded as pecuniary gain or pecuniary advantage, including a benefit to any other person in whose welfare the beneficiary has a direct and substantial interest. 
    Business entity. "Business entity" means a sole proprietorship, partnership, firm, corporation, holding company, joint-stock company, receivership, trust, unincorporated association, or any other entity recognized by law. 
    Code of ethics. "Code of ethics," "ethics code," or "this code" means subdivisions A through J of this division. 
    Confidential government information. "Confidential government information" includes all information held by the city that is not available to the public under the Texas Open Records act and any information from a meeting closed to the public pursuant to the Texas Open Meetings Act, regardless of whether disclosure violates the Act. 
    City. "City" means the City of Eagle Pass. 
    Consanguinity. Relationship by "consanguinity" is defined in Section 573.022 and 573.023 of the Texas Government Code, as amended.

    Economic interest. "Economic interest" includes, but is not limited to, legal or equitable property interests in land, chattels, and intangibles, and contractual rights having more than de minimis monetary value. Service by a city official or employee as an officer, director, advisor, or otherwise active participant in an educational, religious, charitable fraternal, or civic organization does not create for that city official or employee an economic interest in the property of the organization. Ownership of an interest in a mutual or common investment fund that hold securities or other assets is not an economic interest in such securities or other assets unless the person in question participates in the management of the fund. 
    Employee. Except as provided in section 2-231, section 2-243(c), and subdivision G, the term "employee" or "city employee" is any person listed on the city payroll as an employee, whether part-time or full-time. 
    Gift. Other than in subdivision E, "gift" means a voluntary transfer of property (including the payment of money) or the conferral of a benefit having pecuniary value (such as the rendition of services or the forbearance of collection on a debt), unless consideration of equal or greater value is received by the donor as quid pro quo. 
    Indirect ownership. A person "indirectly owns" an equity interest in a business entity where the interest is held through a series of business entities, some of which own interests in others. 
    Official. Except in subdivision E, the term "official" or "city official" includes the following persons: 
Mayor; 
Members of the city council; 
Municipal court judges and magistrates; 
City manager; 
Assistant city manager; 
Assistant to the city manager; 
City secretary; 
Assistant city secretary; 
All department heads and assistant department heads; 
Police department captains and deputy chiefs; 
All appointed assistant fire chiefs and any assistant fire chief who either works in the fire administration building or any other division and is involved in having input to any contract, vehicle specification, or who is otherwise involved with the purchasing of any product, service, or land for the fire department; 
Any fire inspector, plan reviewer or uniformed administrator of the fire prevention division;

Charter review commission; 
Citizens review committee;

    The term "official" has a different meaning in subdivision E, which is defined in section 2-250.12(a). The term "officer" is defined in section 2-231(d)(2) and is not synonymous with any use of the term "official" in this code. 
    Official action. "Official action" includes: 
(1)  Any affirmative act (including the making of a recommendation) within the scope of, or in violation of, an official or employee's duties, and 
(2)  Any failure to act, if the official or employee is under a duty to act and knows that inaction is likely to affect substantially an economic interest of the official or employee or any person or entity listed in section 2-221(a)(2) through (9). 
    Official information. "Official information" includes information gathered pursuant to the power or authority of city government. 
    Ownership. Ownership of an interest in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities or other assets does not constitute direct or indirect ownership of such securities or other assets unless the person in question participates in the management of such securities or other assets unless the person in question participates in the management of the fund. 
    Partner. "Partner" includes partners in general partnerships, limited partnerships, and joint ventures. 
    Personally and substantially participated. The requirement of having "personally and substantially participated" in a matter is met only if the individual in fact exercised discretion relating to the matter. The fact that the person had responsibility for a matter does not by itself establish that the person "personally and substantially participated" in the matter. 
    Representation. "Representation" encompasses all forms of communication and personal appearances in which a person, not acting in performance of official duties, formally or informally serves as an advocate for private interests, regardless of whether the representation is compensated. Lobbying, even on an informal basis, is a form of representation. Representation does not include appearance as a fact witness or uncompensated expert witness in litigation or other official proceedings. 
    Solicitation. "Solicitation" of subsequent employment or business opportunities includes all forms of proposals and negotiations relating thereto.

Subdivision E. - Lobbyists 

Sec. 2-250.11. - Purpose. 
    Citizens play a vital role in the work of government by providing city officials and employees with information and perspectives relevant to issues requiring official action. For that reason, the right to petition the government has been enshrined in the federal and state constitutions and considerable legal protection is extended to those who speak or write on subjects of public concern. In some instances it is necessary or desirable for persons or groups seeking to influence official action to channel their efforts through volunteer or paid representatives. Such representatives, sometimes called lobbyists, can make a valuable contribution to effective government, such as by directing ideas and opinions to appropriate decision makers, persuasively expressing views, answering questions, illuminating the practical consequences of proposed conduct, or bringing to the deliberative process the insights of professional expertise. However, experience has shown that lobbying on behalf of private interests can also be a corrosive influence which distorts the exercise of official power, particularly if such activities occur outside the scrutiny of neutral third parties and if considerable amounts of money are involved. For the purpose of minimizing the risk of improper lobbying, while at the same time recognizing that not all forms of lobbying are improper, the following rules are adopted. 
(Ord. No. 06-22, § 1(part E, § 1), 9-5-2006) 
Sec. 2-250.12. - Definitions. 
    As used in this subdivision, the following words and phrases have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, unless the context requires otherwise: 
(a)  City official means the mayor, members of the city council, municipal judges and magistrates, the city manager, assistant city manager, city secretary, assistant city secretary, all department heads, assistant department heads, and employees in salaried positions listed on the pay plan, members of bid committees, and all members of the boards and commissions appointed by the city council. 
(b)  Client means any person on whose behalf lobbying is conducted. If a person engages in lobbying on that person's own behalf, whether directly or through the acts of others, the person is both a client and a lobbyist (as defined in subsection (g)). In the case of a coalition or association that employs or retains other persons to conduct lobbying activities, the client is the coalition or association and not its individual members. 
(c)  Compensation means money or any other thing of value that is received, or is to be received, in return for or in connection with lobbying services rendered, or to be rendered, including reimbursement of expenses incurred in lobbying. Compensation does not include a payment made to any individual regularly employed by a person if, (1) the payment ordinarily would be made regardless of whether the individual engaged in lobbying activities, and (2) lobbying activities are not part of the individual's regular responsibilities to the person making the payment. Compensation does not include the financial gain that a person may realize as a result of the determination of a municipal question, unless that gain is in the form of a contingent fee. If a lobbyist engages in both lobbying activities and other activities on behalf of a person, compensation for lobbying includes all amounts received from that person, if, for the purpose of evading the obligations imposed under subdivision E, the lobbyist has structured the receipt of compensation in a way that unreasonably minimizes the value of the lobbying activities. 
(d)  Expenditure means a payment, distribution, loan, advance, reimbursement, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value, including a contract, promise, or agreement to make an expenditure, regardless of whether such contract, promise or agreement is legally enforceable. Expenditure does not include an amount paid to any individual regularly employed by a person if, (1) the amounts paid to the individual are ordinarily paid regardless of whether the individual engages in lobbying activities, and (2) lobbying activities are not part of the individual's regular responsibilities to the person making the payment. 
(e)  Gift means a voluntary transfer of property (including the payment of money) or the conferral of a benefit having pecuniary value (such as the retention of services or the forbearance of collection on a debt), unless consideration of equal or greater value is received by the donor of the gift as quid pro quo. For purposes of subdivision E, gift does not include a lawful political contribution; a gift to a city official relating to a special occasion such as a wedding, anniversary, graduation, birth, illness, death, or holiday, provided that the value of the gift is fairly commensurate with the occasion and the relationship between the donor and recipient; reimbursement of reasonable travel expenses in accordance with city policies; a public award or reward for meritorious service or professional achievement, provided that the award or reward is reasonable in light of the occasion; a loan from a lending institution made in its regular course of business on the same terms generally available to the public; a scholarship or fellowship awarded on the same terms and based on the same criteria that is applied to other applicants; or admission to an event in which the city official is participating in connection with official duties. 
(f)  Immediate family means a spouse residing in the person's household and dependent children. 
(g)  Lobbyist means a person who engages in lobbying, whether directly or through the acts of another. If an agent or employee engages in lobbying for a principal or employer, both the agent and the principal, or the employee and the employer, are lobbyists. 
(h)  Lobby or lobbying, except as provided below, means any oral or written communication (including an electronic communication) to a city official, made directly or indirectly by any person in an effort to influence or persuade an official to favor or oppose, recommend or not recommend, vote for or against, or take or refrain from taking action on any municipal question. The term lobby or lobbying does not include a communication: 
(1)  Merely requesting information or inquiring about the facts or status of any municipal question, matter, or procedure, and not attempting to influence a city official; 
(2)  Made by a public official or employee (including, but not limited to, an official or employee of the City of Eagle Pass) acting in his or her official capacity; 
(3)  Made by a representative of a media organization if the purpose of the communication is gathering and disseminating news and information to the public; 
(4)  Made in a speech, article, publication, or other material that is distributed and made available to the public, or through radio, television, cable television, or any other medium of mass communication; 
(5)  Made at a meeting open to the public under the Open Meetings Act; 
(6)  Made in the form of a written comment filed in the course of a public proceeding or any other communication that is made on the record in a public proceeding; 
(7)  Made in writing as a petition for official action and required to be public record pursuant to established city procedures; 
(8)  Made in writing to provide information in response to an oral or written request by a city official for specific information; 
(9)  The content of which is compelled by law; 
(10)  Made in response to a public notice soliciting communications from the public and directed to the official specifically designated in the notice to receive such communications; 
(11)  Made on behalf of an individual with regard to that individual's employment or benefits; or 
(12)  Made by a fact witness or expert witness at an official proceeding. 
(i)  Lobbying firm means: 
(1)  A self-employed lobbyist, or 
(2)  A person that has one or more employees who are lobbyists on behalf of a client or clients other than that person. 
(j)  Municipal question means an issue pending or impending before the city, including but not limited to proposed action, or proposals for action, in the form of ordinances, resolutions, motions, recommendations, reports, regulations, policies, nominations, appointments, sanctions, and bids, including the formulation, modification, or adoption of specifications, awards, grants, or contracts and the administration and execution of city programs and policies.

Each initial or annual financial disclosure report filed by an individual designated in section 2-250.41(a)(1), and each report filed by a candidate for city council, shall disclose information relating to the prior calendar year, as well as any material changes in that information which occurred between the end of the prior calendar year and the date of filing. 
(e)  City secretary. The city secretary shall: 
(1)  Prior to January 15 of each year, notify city officials and employees specified in subsection (a)(1) of their obligation to file financial disclosure reports and provide forms to be completed; 
(2)  Provide forms to all new city council appointees and those filing for elective office, and advise them of reporting requirements and deadlines;

(4)  Review reports for completeness and timeliness; 
(5)  Maintain filing, coding, and cross-indexing systems to carry out the purpose of this subdivision, including:

(6)  Make available for public inspection and copying at reasonable times the reports filed under this subdivision; 
(7)  Upon determining that a city council appointee who is required to file a financial disclosure report has failed to do so timely or has filed incomplete or unresponsive information, notify the individual by certified mail that failure to file or correct the filing within fifteen (15) days after the original deadline constitutes an automatic resignation. At the same time, the city secretary shall publicly announce to the city council the names of those who have not filed and to whom this notification is being sent. If such an appointee fails to file a completed report within fifteen (15) days from the original deadline, the position shall be considered vacant, and a new appointment shall be made by the city council; and 
(8)  Upon determining that the mayor, a member of city council, the city manager, or a municipal judge or magistrate has failed to timely file a financial disclosure report, or has filed incomplete or unresponsive information, notify the individual by certified mail that failure to file or correct the filing within fifteen (15) days after the original deadline will result in the matter being forwarded to the ethics review commission. If the person in question fails to file a completed report within fifteen days of the original deadline, a report of non-compliance shall be forwarded to the ethics review commission for appropriate action. 
(9)  Upon determining that a person other than (A) a city council appointee who is required to file a financial disclosure report, or (B) the mayor, a member of city council, the city manager, or a municipal judge or magistrate, has failed to timely file a financial disclosure report, or has filed incomplete or unresponsive information, notify the individual by certified mail that failure to file or correct the filing within fifteen (15) days after the original deadline will result in the matter being forwarded to the city manager. If the person in question fails to file a completed report within fifteen (15) days of the original deadline, a report of non-compliance shall be forwarded to the city manager for appropriate action. 
The failure of the city secretary to provide any notification required by this section does not bar appropriate remedial action, but may be considered on the issue of culpability.

In addition, copies of the opinion shall be forwarded by the chair of the ethics review commission, or his or her designate, to the ethics compliance officer and to the city secretary. The city secretary shall make the opinion available as a public record in accordance with the Local Government Records Act. 
(3)  Reliance. If a person reasonably and in good faith acts in reliance on an advisory opinion issued by the ethics review commission, that fact may be considered by an ethics panel in adjudicating a complaint filed against that person, but does not by itself bar the finding of a violation. 
(b)  Opinions issued by the ethics compliance officer. 
(1)  Requests by city officials and employees. 
(A)  By writing filed with the office of the city attorney, any city official or employee may request an advisory opinion with respect to whether proposed action by that person would violate the ethics laws. 
(B)  Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request by the office of the city attorney, the ethics compliance officer shall issue a written advisory opinion. The advisory opinion shall not reveal the name of the person who made the request, if that person requested anonymity, in which case the opinion shall be written in the form of a response to an anonymous, hypothetical fact situation. Copies of the opinion shall be forwarded by the ethics compliance officer to the members of the ethics review commission, to the person who requested the opinion, and to the city secretary. The city secretary shall make the opinion available as a public record in accordance with the Local Government Records Act. 
(2)  Reliance. 
(A)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(2)(C), a person who reasonably and in good faith acts in accordance with an advisory opinion issued by the ethics compliance officer may not be found to have violated the ethics laws by engaging in conduct approved in the advisory opinion, provided that: 
(i)  He or she requested the issuance of the opinion; 
(ii)  The request for an opinion fairly and accurately disclosed all relevant facts; and 
(iii)  Less than five (5) years elapsed between the date the opinion was issued and the date of the conduct in question. 
(B)  If a person who did not request an advisory opinion reasonably and in good faith acts in reliance on an opinion issued by the ethics compliance officer, that fact may be considered by an ethics panel in adjudicating a complaint filed against the person, but does not by itself bar the finding of a violation. 
(C)  If within ten (10) days of receiving an advisory opinion issued by the ethics compliance officer (see subsection (b)(1)(B)) any member of the ethics review commission request review of the opinion, the chair of the ethics review commission shall designate an ethics panel, pursuant to the rules of the commission, to consider whether the opinion correctly applies the law to the facts stated in the opinion. The ethics panel shall conduct its review promptly and shall issue a written opinion approving or disapproving the advisory opinion. Reasons for disapproval shall be stated. Copies of the opinion of the ethics panel shall be provided by the chair of the ethics review commission to the ethics compliance officer, to any members of the ethics review commission who did not participate in the ethics panel, to the city secretary, and, through the ethics compliance officer, to the person who requested the advisory opinion. The city secretary shall make the opinion available as a public record in accordance with the Local Government Records Act. An advisory opinion which has been disapproved by an ethics panel is not binding on the ethics review commission. The city secretary shall ensure that any public record of a disapproved advisory opinion reflects the fact that it is not binding on the commission. If a person acts in reliance on a disapproved advisory opinion, that fact may be considered by an ethics panel in adjudicating a complaint filed against the person, but does not bar the finding of a violation. If no member of the ethics review commission requests review of an advisory opinion within ten (10) days of receiving the opinion from the ethics compliance officer, the commission is deemed to have approved the opinion.

Sec. 2-261. - Declaration of policy. 
    Policy. It is the policy of the city to provide for the fair and prompt investigation of any complaint made against a peace officer or employee of the PD of the city through the IAD; that the conclusions/findings of the IAD be proper keeping in mind the rights and interests of the affected peace officer or employee on the one hand and the complainant on the other; and that a review of the conclusions/findings of the IAD by an independent CRC which, following that review, may make a recommendation to the chief of police ("chief") of the PD for final determination is a goal that the council believes will both strengthen the PD and maintain a high level of public trust the citizens of the city have in its peace officers and employees of the PD. The council, therefore, believes that the establishment of a CRC will be in the best interest of the citizens of the city as well as the peace officers and employees of the PD of the city.

d.  Criteria for considering effect of actions on historic buildings. The board, in considering the appropriateness of any reconstruction, alteration, maintenance, or moving of a historic building or any part of or appurtenance to such building, including walls, fences, light fixtures, steps, paving, and signs shall require that such work be done in a manner that will preserve the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, or appurtenance. In considering historic and architectural character, the board shall consider, among other things, the following: 
(1)  Purposes of this article; 
(2)  Historical and architectural value and significance of the building, structure, site or appurtenance; 
(3)  Compatibility and significance of additions, alterations, details, materials, or other non-original elements which may be of a different style and construction date than the original; 
(4)  The texture, material, color, style, and detailing of the building, structure, site or appurtenance;

(7)  The position of the building or structure in relation to the street, public right-of-way and to other buildings and structures. 
e.  Procedure for demolition upon denial of a certificate of appropriateness. The purpose of this subsection is to preserve historic buildings that are important to the education, culture, traditions and economic values of the city, and to afford the city, historical organizations, and other interested persons the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the preservation of these buildings. If a property owner demonstrates that a historic building is incapable of earning an economic return on its value, as appraised by a qualified real estate appraiser, and the board fails to approve the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, the building may be demolished. However, before a demolition permit is issued or demolition proceeds, the following requirements for notice must be met: 
(1)  Notice of the proposed demolition must be given for a period fixed by the board, based on the board's classification on the approved map, but not less than sixty (60) calendar days or more than one (1) year. 
(2)  Notice must be posted on the premises of the building proposed for demolition in a location clearly visible from the street. 
(3)  Notice must be published in a newspaper of general local circulation at least three (3) times before demolition, with the first publication not more than fifteen (15) calendar days after the application for a permit to demolish is filed, and the final publication at least fifteen (15) calendar days before the date of the permit. 
    The board may approve a certificate of appropriateness at any time during the notice period under this subsection. If the certificate of appropriateness is approved, a demolition permit shall be issued without further delay, and demolition may proceed.

If a conflict occurs between the Texas Administrative Code and this Section, the most stringent provision shall prevail. 
(b)  Outdoor burning prohibited. Outdoor burning of any kind is prohibited, except where such burning is authorized pursuant to an exception as specified below or, by a permit issued by the city. This prohibition includes the burning of household trash, furniture, electrical insulation, treated and untreated lumber, plastics, non-wood construction/demolition materials, heavy oils, asphaltic materials, chemical wastes, natural or synthetic rubbers, garbage of any form, or municipal solid waste, including grass, leaves, and branch trimmings. 
(c)  Outdoor disposal or deposits of ignitable material prohibited. The outdoor disposal or disposition of any material capable of igniting spontaneously, with the exception of solid fossil fuels, is prohibited. 
(d)  Exceptions. Outdoor burning may be authorized under the following exceptions and where applicable, pursuant to a permit issued by the city: 
(i)  Fire training. Outdoor burning shall be authorized for training fire-fighting personnel. Facilities dedicated solely for fire-fighting training shall provide an annual written notification of intent to the fire marshal and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ"), and shall provide each with telephone or electronic facsimile notice at least 24-hours in advance of any scheduled training session. No more than one such notification is required for multiple training sessions scheduled within any one-week period, provided the initial notice includes the specific dates and times of all sessions. 
(ii)  Outdoor fires for noncommercial food preparation. Outdoor fires are allowed for cooking, provided such fire is built and maintained in a pit that fully contains the fire, or a fireproof container such as a barbeque pit or chimney, made of brick, stone, metal or other fireproof material in such a manner as to prevent any fire from escaping. Outdoor fires for non-commercial food preparation do not require a burn permit. This exception does not permit or authorize the burning of waste or other matters not being prepared for consumption. 
(iii)  Fires used for recreation and ceremony. Outdoor burning may be authorized for fires used solely for recreational or ceremonial purposes pursuant to the issuance of a city permit. 
(iv)  Disposal fires. The city may authorize outdoor burning for the following purposes and pursuant to a city-issued permit: 
A.  Diseased animal carcass burning where burning is the most effective means of controlling the spread of disease. 
B.  On-site burning of trees, brush, and other plant growth for right-of-way maintenance, land clearing operations, and maintenance along water canals when a practical alternative to burning does not exist and when the materials are generated only from that property. Sensitive receptors (neighboring properties, persons, animals) must not be negatively affected by the burn. For a single project entailing multiple days of burning, an initial notice delineating the scope of the burn is sufficient if the scope does not constitute circumvention of the rule for a continual burning situation. 
C.  Crop residue burning for agricultural maintenance purposes when no practical alternative exists. Structures containing sensitive receptors must not be negatively affected by the burn. 
D.  Brush trees and other plant growth causing a detrimental public health and safety condition may be burned by a local government at a site it owns upon receiving approval from the fire marshal. Such a burn shall only be authorized where there is no practical alternative, and it may be done no more frequently than once every two months. 
(v)  Prescribed burn. The city may authorize outdoor burning for prescribed burning for forest, range, and wild land/wildlife management purposes pursuant to the issuance of a city permit. Such burning is prohibited where the fire marshal determines that the burning will have an adverse effect on any building or structure. In addition, the fire marshal may revoke the authority to burn at any time if the burning causes nuisance conditions, is not conducted in accordance with the specified conditions, violates any provision of an applicable permit, or causes a violation of any air quality standard. 
(vi)  Hydrocarbon burning. The city may authorize outdoor burning for hydrocarbon burning from pipeline breaks and oil spills only upon proper notification to TCEQ and after the fire marshal has determined that the burning is necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Sampling and monitoring may be required to determine and evaluate environmental impacts. 
(vii)  Other necessary burning. If not otherwise authorized by this Section, outdoor burning may be authorized by city permit if there is no practical alternative and if the burning will not cause or contribute to a nuisance, traffic hazard or to a violation of any federal or state primary or secondary ambient air standard. The fire marshal may specify procedures or methods to control or abate emissions from outdoor burning authorized pursuant to this rule. The fire marshal may revoke the authority to burn at any time if the burning causes nuisance conditions, is not conducted in accordance with the specified conditions, violates any provision of an applicable permit, or causes a violation of any air quality standard. 
(e)  Revocation of permit or authority to burn. The fire marshal is authorized to revoke any person's or entity's right to conduct an outdoor burn, and to pursue any legal recourse against the person or entity, if the fire marshal determines that federal or state law, this Section, or a permit was violated. 
(f)  Responsibility for consequences of outdoor burning. The authority to conduct outdoor burning under this Section does not exempt or excuse any person responsible from the consequences, damages, or injuries resulting from the burning, and does not exempt or excuse anyone from complying with all other applicable laws or ordinances, regulations and orders of governmental entities having jurisdiction, even though the burning is otherwise conducted in compliance with this Section. Further, each permitted assumes all liability and responsibility for all damages to all persons or property caused by burning hereunder.

    A-Zones are found on all flood hazard boundary maps (FHBMs), flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs), and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs). An A-Zone is an area that would be flooded by the Base Flood and is the same as a special flood hazard area (SFHA) or a 100-year floodplain. These areas may be unnumbered as AE, AH, or AO Zones. Numbered A-Zones indicate an area's risk to flooding. 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Amortization period is the length of time used to repay a debt or mortgage or to depreciate an initial cost. 
    Amortization rate is the price or rate of premium per unit of time that is paid by a borrower for repayment of a debt or mortgage or by a purchaser to depreciate an initial cost.

Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is an area having special flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards, as shown on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AOA, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M, or E. 
    Backwater effect is the rise in water surface elevation caused by some obstruction such as a narrow bridge opening, buildings, or fill materials that limits the area through which the water must flow. Also referred to as "heading up". 
    Base flood is a term used in the National Flood Insurance Program to indicate the minimum size flood to be used by a community as a basis for its floodplain management regulations; currently required by regulation to be that flood which has a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also known as a 100-year flood or one-percent chance flood. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) is the elevation for which there is a one-percent chance in any given year that flood levels will equal or exceed it. The BFE is determined by statistical analysis for each local area and designated on the flood insurance rate maps. It is also known as the 100-year flood elevation.

    Berm is a bank or mound of earth, usually placed against a foundation wall. 
    Breakaway wall is a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. Breakaway walls are required by NFIP regulations in coastal high-hazard areas (V-Zones) and are recommended in areas where flood waters could flow at significant velocities (usually greater than four (4) feet per second) or could contain ice or other debris. 
    Building code is the regulations adopted by a governing body setting forth standards for the construction, addition, modification, and repair of buildings and other structures for the purpose of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.

    Cross section is a graph or plot of ground elevation across a stream valley or a portion of it, usually along a line perpendicular to the stream or direction of flow. 
    Debris impact loads are sudden loads induced on a structure by debris carried by flood water. Though difficult to predict, allowances for impact loads must be made when floodproofing a structure. 
    Designated floodway is the channel of a stream and that portion of the adjoining floodplain designated by a regulatory agency to be kept free of further development to provide for unobstructed passage of flood flows. 
    Design flood is commonly used to mean the magnitude of flood used for design and operation of flood control structures or other protective measures. It is sometimes used to denote the magnitude of flood used in floodplain regulations. 
    Development means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or of equipment or materials. 
    Dry floodproofing is a method used to design and construct buildings so as to prevent the entrance of floodwaters. 
    Elevated building means a non basement building built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers) or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X or D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Elevation is the placement of a structure above flood level to minimize or prevent flood damages. 
    Emergency Flood Insurance Program or emergency program means the program as implemented on an emergency basis in accordance with Section 1336 of the Act. It is intended as a program to provide a first layer amount of insurance on all insurable structures before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Enabling statute is state law that transfers some of the police power residing in the state to localities within if for the purposes of zoning, subdivision, regulations, building codes and the like. 
    Encroachment is any physical object placed in a floodplain that hinders the passage of water or otherwise affects flood flows, such as landfills or buildings. 
    Erosion means the process of the gradual wearing away of land masses. This peril is not per se covered under the program. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before the date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Extended foundation is the construction of additional wall above existing foundation walls in order to elevate a structure above flood levels. 
    Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the agency created in 1979 to provide a single point of accountability for all federal activities related to disaster mitigation, emergency preparedness, response and recover. 
    Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) is the government unit, a part of FEMA that administers the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Fill is material such as earth, clay, or crushed stone that is dumped in an area and compacted to increase ground elevation. 
    Flash flood is a flood that crests in a short length of time and is often characterized by high velocity flow. It is often the result of heavy rainfall in a localized area. 
    Flood or flooding means:

(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(3)  Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
(b)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this definition. 
    Flood boundary floodway map (FBFM) is a map that may be included with a Flood Insurance Study printed prior to 1986. It identifies the floodway and, along with the study provides the technical basis for floodplain management regulations. 
    Flood control is keeping flood waters away from specific developments or populated areas by the construction of flood storage reservoirs, channel alternations, dikes and levees, by pass channels, or other engineering works. 
    Flood crest is the maximum stage or elevation reached or expected to be reached by the waters of a specific flood at a given location. 
    Flood disaster assistance includes development of comprehensive, preparedness and recovery plans, program capabilities, and organization of federal agencies and of state and local governments to mitigate the adverse effects of disastrous floods. It may include maximum hazard reduction, avoidance, and mitigation measures, as well as policies, procedures, and eligibility criteria for Federal grant or loan assistance to state and local governments, private organizations, or individuals as the result of the major disaster. 
    Flood duration is the length of time a stream is above flood stage or overflowing its banks. 
    Flood fighting [means] action taken immediately before or during a flood to protect human life and to reduce flood damages such as evacuation, emergency sandbagging, sand diking, and provision of assistance to flood victims. 
    Flood forecasting [means] the process of predicting the occurrence, magnitude, and duration of an imminent flood through meteorological and hydrological observations and analysis. 
    Flood frequency [means] a statistical expression of the average time period between floods equaling or exceeding a given magnitude. For example, a 100-year flood has a magnitude expected to be equaled or exceeded on the average of once every hundred (100) years: such a flood has one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Often used interchangeably with recurrence interval. 
    Flood fringe [means] that portion of the floodplain that lies beyond the floodway and serves as a temporary storage area for flood waters during a flood. This section receives waters that are shallower and of lower velocities than those of the floodway. 
    Flood hazard is the potential for inundation and involves the risk of life, health, property, and natural value. Two references base are commonly used: (1) For most situations, the base flood is that flood which has one percent chance of being exceeded in any given year (also known as the 100-year flood); (2) for critical actions, an activity for which a one percent chance of flooding would be too great, at a minimum the base flood is that flood which has a 0.2 percent chance of being exceeded in any given year (also known as the 500-year flood).

    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended, and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding"). 
    Floodplain management is the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations.

The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodplain restoration is the reestablishment of a setting or environment in which the natural functions of the floodplain can again operate. 
    Floodplain values are those natural and beneficial attributes associated with the relatively undisturbed state of the floodplain and includes values primarily associated with water, living, and cultural resources. 
    Flood profile is a graph showing the relationship of water surface elevation to a specific location, the latter generally expressed as distance above the mouth of a stream of water flowing in an open channel. It is generally drawn to show surface elevations for the crest of a specific magnitude of flooding, but may be prepared for conditions at any given time or stage. 
    Floodproofing is any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodwall is a constructed barrier of resistant material, such as concrete or masonry block, designed to keep water away from a structure. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Flood warning is the issuance and dissemination of information about an imminent or current flood.

    Foundation walls are the support structure of a building that connects the foundation to the main portion of the building or superstructure. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effects of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

    Impact loads are loads induced by the collision of solid objects on a structure carried by floodwater. Debris can include trees, lumber, displaced sections of structures, tanks, runaway boats, and chunks of ice. Debris impact loads are difficult to predict accurately, yet reasonable allowances must be made for them in the design of potentially affected structures. 
    Infiltration is the flow of fluid into a substance through pores or small openings. The work is commonly used to denote the flow of water into soil. 
    Interior grade beam is a section of a floor slab that has a thicker section of concrete to act as a footing to provide stability under load-bearing or critical structural walls.

An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar recreational vehicles. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.

    Pile is an upright support member of a building, usually long and slender in shape, driven into the ground by mechanical means and primarily supported by friction between the pile and the surrounding earth. Piles often cannot act as individual support units, and require bracing to other pilings. 
    Posts are a long upright support units for a building that are set in pre-dug holes and backfilled with compacted material. Each post usually requires bracing to other units. They are also known as columns, although they are usually made of wood.

    Recurrence interval is a statistical expression of the average time between floods equaling or exceeding a given magnitude (see flood frequency). 
    Regulatory flood datum is an established plane of reference from which elevation and depth of flooding may be determined for specific locations of the floodplain. It is the base flood plus a freeboard factor of safety established for each particular area that tends to compensate for the many unknown and incalculable factors that could contribute to greater flood heights than that computed for a base flood. 
    Regulatory floodplain is that portion of the floodplain subject to floodplain regulations (usually the floodplain inundated by the one-percent chance flood). 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

    Runoff is that portion of precipitation that is not intercepted by vegetation, absorbed by the land surface, or evaporated, and thus flows overland into a depression, stream, lake, or ocean (runoff, called immediate subsurface runoff, also takes place in the upper layers of the soil). 
    Scouring is the erosion, or washing away, of slopes or soil by velocity waters. 
    Seepage is the passage of water or other fluid through a porous medium, such as the passage of water through an earth embankment or masonry wall.

    Stile means a set of stairs to allow access over an obstruction, such as floodwall. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basements, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

    Subsidence is the sinking of land surface, usually due to withdrawals of underground water, oil, or minerals. 
    Subsidized rates means the rules established by the administrator involving in the aggregate a subsidization by the Federal Government. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Under seepage is seepage along the bottom of a structure, floodwall, or levee, or through the layer of earth beneath it. 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements, see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Venting is a system designed to allow flood waters to enter an enclosure, usually the interior of a foundation walls, so that the rising water does not create a dangerous differential in hydrostatic pressure. This is usually achieved through small openings in the wall, such as a missing or rotated brick or concrete block or small pipe. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse is a natural or artificial channel in which a flow of water occurs either continually or intermittently. 
    Watershed is an area that drains to a single point. In a natural basin, this is the area contributing flow to a given place or stream.

(Ord. No. 05-39, § 1, 11-15-2005) 
Sec. 131/2-19. - Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator. 
(a)  Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the following permit application review before issuing a floodplain development permit: 
(1)  Review all applications for completeness, and to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334, and for compliance with the provisions and standards of this law. 
(2)  Review subdivision and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the applicable standards of article III of this chapter (Construction Standards) and, in particular, subsection 131/2-25(a)(1) of this chapter (subdivision proposals). 
(3)  Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local administrator may require the applicant to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to complete the determination. 
(4)  Determine that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by state or federal law. 
(b)  Use of other flood data. 
(1)  When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated areas of special flood hazard on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, including data developed pursuant to [section] 131/2-25(c) of this chapter (Residential structures (except costal hazard areas)), as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed development meet the requirements of this law. 
(2)  When base flood elevation data are not available, the local administrator may use flood information from any other authority's source, such as historical data, to establish flood elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes of this law. 
(3)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the local administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. 
(c)  Alteration of watercourses. 
(1)  Notification to adjacent communities and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality prior to permitting any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submittal of evidence of such notification to the Regional Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(2)  Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that flood carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(d)  Construction stage. 
(1)  In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or flood proofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use). 
(2)  Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the project unless immediately corrected. 
(e)  Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions. 
(f)  Stop work orders.

(1)  Abatement-Junked vehicles. Upon complaint or upon its own initiative, the code enforcement division may initiate appropriate official action to remove and abate a public nuisance in the nature of a junked vehicle or junked vehicle part. Notice of the existence of a nuisance shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter. 
a.  For a public nuisance that exists on private property, the code enforcement division shall notify the last known registered owner of the junked vehicle or junked vehicle part, any lien holder of record, and the owner or occupant of the private premises on which the public nuisance exists, that the nuisance exists, that it must be removed and abated within ten (10) days of the delivery or mail of such notice, or that a request for a hearing must be made by the owner or occupant before the expiration of the ten-day time period from the delivery or mail of the notice. The notice shall be personally delivered or sent by certified mail with a five-day return receipt requested. If the post office address of the last known registered owner of the motor vehicle is unknown, notice to the last known registered owner may be placed on the motor vehicle or, if the last known registered owner is physically located, the notice may be hand delivered. If any notice is returned undelivered by the United States Post Office, further official action to abate the nuisance shall be continued to a date not less than ten (10) days after the date of return. 
b.  For a public nuisance that exists on public property, the code enforcement division shall notify the last known registered owner of the junked vehicle or junked vehicle part, any lien holder of record, and the owner or occupant of the public premises or the owner or occupant of the premises adjacent to the public right-of-way on which the public nuisance exists, that the nuisance exists, that it must be removed and abated within ten (10) days of the delivery or mail of such notice, or that a request for a hearing must be made by the owner or occupant before the expiration of the ten-day period from the delivery or mail of the notice. The notice shall be personally delivered or sent by certified mail with a five-day return receipt requested. If the post office address of the last known registered owner of the motor vehicle is unknown, notice to the last known registered owner may be placed on the motor vehicle or, if the last known registered owner is physically located, the notice may be hand delivered. If any notice is returned undelivered by the United States Post Office, further official action to abate the nuisance shall be continued to a date not less than ten (10) days after the date of return. 
c.  A public hearing shall be held before the municipal court of the city for determination of the existence of a junked vehicle or junked vehicle part as a public nuisance and for the purpose of entering an order requiring the removal of the same if found to be so. Notice of this hearing shall be sent by certified mail to the last known registered owner of the junked vehicle or junked vehicle part, any lien holder of record, the owner or occupant of the private premises, public premises or the premises adjacent to the public right-of-way, as the case may be, not less than ten (10) days before the date of the hearing. At the hearing it is presumed, unless demonstrated otherwise by the owner, that the vehicle is inoperable. The judge of the municipal court shall be the designated official to make such determination and upon the finding that the vehicle or vehicle part is a junked vehicle and constitutes a public nuisance, he shall enter an order requiring the removal of the vehicle or a part thereof. The order must include a description of the vehicle or vehicle part and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle if the information is available at the site. 
d.  Before any city employee or any other person is authorized to remove a vehicle or vehicle part that is in violation of this chapter, he shall first obtain from the appropriate court an order for the removal of the junked vehicle or junked vehicle part, which shall include a description of the vehicle or vehicle part and the correct identification and license number of the vehicle if the information is available at the site where the vehicle or vehicle part is located. 
e.  A junked vehicle or vehicle part may be disposed of by removal to a scrap yard, demolisher or any suitable site operated by the city for processing of scrap or salvage; however, it is unlawful for any person to reconstruct or make operable any junked vehicle after it has been removed. 
f.  Not later than the fifth day after the removal of a junked vehicle or junked vehicle part, the city shall notify the state department of highways and public transportation of the removal of the junked vehicle or junked vehicle part, so that the department may cancel the certificate of title. The notice must identify the vehicle or vehicle part.

(3)  An unlicensed, operable or inoperable antique or special interest vehicle stored by a collector on the collector's property. Covering a junked vehicle with a cover that is custom-tailored or custom-fitted to the particular model of the vehicle being covered will abate the nuisance. The vehicle cover shall be made of a canvas of closely woven, coarse cloth of hemp, cotton or linen that is both water and mildew resistant and shall be maintained free of any tears or holes. To abate the nuisance, the vehicles shall be completely covered, with the exception of the vehicle tires, and the cover shall be secured by a tie-down device. Tires shall be mounted on the vehicle and shall be properly inflated. All four (4) tires must be on the ground. It is the vehicle owner's responsibility to ensure that the vehicle remains completely covered. Placing the junked vehicle behind trees or shrubbery does not abate the public nuisance. No more than one (1) antique or special interest vehicle may be kept per two thousand (2,000) square feet of unroofed yard where a vehicle may be legally parked. 
(f)  Enforcement authority-Junked vehicles. 
(1)  The procedures provided for in this chapter must be administered by the code enforcement division except that the removal of a vehicle or vehicle part from property may be by any duly authorized person. 
(2)  Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the inspector has reasonable cause to believe that there exists upon any premises any condition or code violation which makes such vehicle or vehicle part in violation of this chapter, the inspector may enter such premises at all times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed upon the inspector by this chapter; provided, that if the premises are occupied, he shall first present proper credentials and request entry, and if the premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the inspector shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. 
(3)  When the inspector has obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry thereon by the inspector for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter. 
(g)  Enforcement-Junked vehicles. If the public nuisance is not removed and abated and no hearing is requested within the ten-day period provided for herein, the code enforcement division may file a complaint concerning the public nuisance in an appropriate court. 
(h)  Violation-Junked vehicles. 
(1)  If a person is found guilty of maintaining a public nuisance as provided in this chapter, that person shall be punished by a fine and/or administrative penalty not to exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00) and the court shall order removal and abatement of the nuisance. Should the person charged with maintaining a public nuisance as provided in this chapter, plead guilty to the charge and pay the fine and/or administrative penalty established by the court for such offense, the court shall declare the junked vehicle or junked vehicle part a public nuisance and order removal and abatement of the nuisance. All orders under this section must include a description of the vehicle and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle if the information is available at the site. 
(2)  Violation of section; liability of corporate officers, agent, etc. In case the owner or occupant of any lot or premises under the provisions of this section shall be a corporation or other entity, and shall violate any provision of this section, the president, vice-president, secretary, or treasurer of such corporation or other entity, or any manager, agent or employee of such corporation or other entity shall be also severely liable for any penalty.

(2)  Contractual write-off. Any amount of the EMS bill that the city by contract or agreement has agreed to discount its fees. 
(3)  Transportation consent form. Patients are required, if able, to sign a consent form acknowledging consent for treatment, provide authorization to submit a bill on the patient's behalf, assign benefits to the city allowing insurance payment directly to the city. 
(4)  Uninsured patients. Any patient treated that does not have any form of medical insurance to cover any portion of the ambulance service. A patient is considered uninsured for ambulance billing if they have a medical insurance policy that excludes or does not provide reimbursement for ambulance transportation. 
(5)  Non-medically necessary transport. Any transport that does not meet the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS) criteria for transportation by ambulance. CMS is the sole determining factor for determining medical necessity. Medicare has two definitions for medical necessity 1) emergency and 2) non-emergency: 
a.  Medical emergency. Medicare defines as a "sudden onset of a medical condition of sufficient severity such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the beneficiary's health in serious jeopardy; serious impairment to bodily functions; or serious dysfunction of any body organ or part. 
b.  Non-emergency medical transport. CMS requires that a beneficiary's condition contraindicates any other form of transportation. That is the beneficiary must be "bed confined" and the doctor or other medical professional must certify that ambulance transport was medically necessary. 
1.  Bed confined. Must meet all the following criteria: 
Patient is unable to get up from bed without assistance; and 
Patient is unable to walk; and 
Patient is unable to sit in a chair or wheelchair. 
(b)  Patient financial responsibility. The patient by using the city's EMS services has incurred a legal debt for services rendered. The debt is legal even if the patient did not summon EMS services, but used the service. The patient or responsible party is liable for all fees associated with providing EMS services from the city. The patient is responsible for payment if a transportation consent form was not able to be signed. 
(c)  Contractual write-offs. The city will follow and adhere to all contractual agreements with insurance providers, both private and governmental (Medicare/Medicaid), to "write-off" balances. Patients will not be responsible for contractual write-off amounts. 
(d)  EMS fees. EMS fees are set by city council and are adjusted periodically to reflect the Medicare/Medicaid set rate rounded up to the nearest whole dollar. For those items/supplies not set with Medicare/Medicaid rate the city manager shall set a fair market rate to include a cost analysis and cost of intervention and cost of administration. Fees are a matter of public record and are available from normal municipal information channels. 
(e)  Insurance reimbursement. The city, as a courtesy to patients, will submit for insurance reimbursement. 
(1)  The patient is responsible to ensure that the city has all information needed to submit and receive timely payment from insurance carriers. 
(2)  The city's submission of insurance does not release the patient from the legal responsibility of the debt. 
(3)  If the patient's insurance company does not provide payment within one hundred eighty (180) days of claims submission, the patient will then become responsible for the amount due. It will then be the patient's responsibility to recover from the insurance company. 
(f)  Deductibles, co-pays, etc. The patient is responsible for any deductibles, co-pays, and non-covered portions of the fee. A statement will be mailed to the patient reviewing account status. However, the patient is responsible for providing accurate information to the city so statements can be properly mailed. 
(g)  Payments. Payments may be made to the city at its designated address. 
(1)  Mailed payments may only be personal check, certified check, money order, or credit card. Cash payments are not accepted through the mail. 
(2)  Cash payments may be made at the Eagle Pass Fire Department Office located at 2558 El Indio Highway, Eagle Pass, Texas 78852. 
(3)  The city's billing agent accepts Visa, Master Card, and American Express credit cards for payment. 
(h)  Payment plans. If the patient demonstrates an inability to pay the entire bill on time in lump sum, a payment plan may be established with the following parameters: 
(1)  Minimum payment is the greater of twenty dollars ($20.00) or five (5) percent of the total bill. 
(2)  Payments will be agreed upon amounts and duration. 
(3)  Any payment plan may not exceed twenty (20) months in duration. 
(4)  The city will not impose interest or fees on payment plans. 
(5)  Any payments over thirty (30) days late will cause the payment plan to be cancelled and full payment due immediately. 
(6)  The patient will receive a monthly statement as a reminder. 
(i)  Small balance write-off. Any patient balance of ten dollars ($10.00) or less may be written off as uncollectible after ninety (90) days from receipt of last payment, with no consequence to the patient. 
(j)  Collections. Any patient that has a balance greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and who has not made a payment or attempted to contact the city or its billing agent for one hundred eighty (180) days from last payment may be turned over to a collection agency to recover the outstanding debt. The collection agency may report the unpaid debt to credit report agencies. 
(k)  Deceased patients. If a patient is deceased, then the estate is responsible for any outstanding bills. Upon presentation of a death certificate and an accompanying statement that the patient has no probated estate, the account debt may be dismissed. 
(l)  Uninsured patients. 
(1)  The city will accept as full payment from city residents who are uninsured the amount that Medicare would have paid, if the patient was insured by Medicare upon submittal of an affidavit of no insurance (Exhibit 1) along with a request for relief of ambulance charge (Exhibit 2). Upon approval, the patient's account will be adjusted. 
(2)  If the patient has a fiscal hardship, a payment plan may be approved as outlined in subsection (h). 
(3)  If the patient has been determined as indigent by any bona fide agency within Maverick County, account will be written off except for any out of pocket payment as required by said agency. Patient must submit indigent form in order to receive this benefit.

ARTICLE II. - DRILLING BLOCKS AND PRODUCTION UNITS 

Sec. 19.5-18. - Drilling blocks. 
(a)  In order that the purpose and intent of this chapter, as stated in section 19.5-1, shall be carried out and future drilling for oil and gas within the city may proceed in an orderly manner, and for convenience and clarity in identifying the location of approved or proposed drilling locations, the area of the city to which this chapter applies (with the exceptions noted in section 19.5-20) has been divided into drilling blocks, each containing approximately forty (40) acres. Each block is shown and identified on the map attached hereto as Exhibit A. 
(b)  All mineral interests in each drilling block shall be utilized as herein provided with the exceptions noted in section 19.5-20. No application to drill on any drilling block where all or part is required to be unitized will be approved unless the applicant shows that he owns or controls by voluntary agreement more than fifty-one (51) percent of the total operating rights in the drilling block, or that portion of the block left after deducting exempt acreage, to be unitized. No more than one (1) completion shall be made in any reservoir on any drilling block except under state-owned leases until special field rules have been adopted by the RRC for the reservoir. The final well density within each drilling block will be no greater than that prescribed by the railroad commission in special field rules which may be adopted for the field.

Such metes-and-bounds description shall be prepared by a surveyor licensed by the State of Texas, and shall conform to the extent reasonably possible to the outlines of drilling blocks shown on Exhibit A. No such metes-and-bounds description shall be approved by the department unless its outside boundaries substantially conform to the general pattern shown on Exhibit A. When so approved, such description shall become the official legal description of the drilling block therein for all purposes hereunder. The department shall take into account the metes-and-bounds description of all previously approved drilling blocks in determining the propriety of the description furnished in connection with any permit application in order to obtain ultimate conformity to the pattern shown on Exhibit A. 
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 1, 3-18-2014) 
Note- See the note following § 19.5-2. 
Sec. 19.5-20. - Exemptions to unitization and well density requirements. 
    Exemptions to unitization and well density requirements shall be subject to the following criteria: 
(1)  Each drilling block, as to all depths and all minerals hereunder, is exempt from the well density and unitization provisions of this chapter when an existing well, as defined in section 19.5-2(11) hereof, is situated thereon and such unitization and density exemption shall continue so long as said existing well is not required to be plugged and thereafter shall continue to be exempt if the conditions in subsection (4) of this section are met. 
(2)  All or such portion of a drilling block which is included in a pooled unit with an existing well situated on said unit is exempt and shall continue exempt after such well is required to be plugged, if the conditions of subsection (4) of this section are met. 
(3)  All or such portion of a drilling block which is included in a pooled unit with an existing well situated on such unit or which is covered by an oil and gas lease or leases and allocated to an existing well in which common ownership exists between said well and said lease or leases is exempt from the well density and unitization provisions of this chapter and such exemption shall continue after the existing well is required to be plugged if the conditions of subsection (4) of this section are met. 
(4)  Upon a cessation of production in paying quantities from any existing well (unless the well meets the conditions described in paragraph (e) in section 19.5-86), and if additional drilling or reworking operations are commenced on such well or a replacement well is commenced within ninety (90) calendar days and prosecuted with no cessation of more than ninety (90) consecutive days until production of oil, gas or other mineral is restored, such production shall continue as an exemption from the well density and unitization provisions of this chapter. 
(5)  Wherever, under subsection (2) of this section, a portion only of a drilling block is exempt, if the remaining portion of a drilling block is twenty (20) acres or more, it shall thereafter constitute the drilling block. If the remaining portion is less than twenty (20) acres, it also shall be exempt as part of the original drilling block and operated under the same conditions. 
(6)  All exempt activities shall be documented in writing by the planning department. 
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 1, 3-18-2014) 
Sec. 19.5-21. - Removal of exemption. 
    When exempt acreage, which constitutes only a part of a drilling block, no longer meets any condition for exemption provided in section 19.5-20, such acreage shall become a part of the original drilling block out of which it was taken and subject to all the provisions of this chapter; provided however, that if there is then a producing well on the remaining part of said original drilling block, that acreage which was previously exempt shall become part of whatever other drilling block to which it is adjacent with which it has the longest common boundary and on which there is no producing well or existing exemption from the well density and unitization provisions of this chapter; and provided further, that if there is no such other adjacent drilling block, the acreage which has lost its exemption shall become a separately designated drilling block with the same number as the original number of the drilling block out of which it was taken but with the letter "F" following the number. 
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 1, 3-18-2014) 
Sec. 19.5-22. - Formation of production units larger than drilling blocks. 
    It is realized that unit areas larger than a drilling block are sometimes desirable and more beneficial to effectively develop and drain a hydrocarbon reservoir. To this end it is therefore permissible for an applicant or a permittee to form unitized areas, as to specific or all horizons, larger than the drilling block in which a well has been drilled. After the effective date, the formation of a production unit which is larger than a single drilling block shall be subject to the following requirements: 
(1)  Such a production unit shall consist of an area which embraces contiguous entire drilling blocks within which the operator shall have more than fifty-one (51) percent of the operating rights in each drilling block included in such production unit. 
(2)  No such production unit will be formed in a manner that will prevent the inclusion of any adjoining drilling block with other acreage to form another production unit larger than such adjoining drilling block unless the operator proposing to form the original production unit presents evidence reasonably acceptable to the planning department that they have given an opportunity to the mineral interest owners in said adjoining drilling block by thirty (30) calendar days written notice, delivered to or mailed by certified mail to their last known address, offering the option to unitize their interests with the mineral interests in the production unit proposed to be formed by the operator. If the owners of more than fifty-one (51) percent of the operating rights, as operating rights are defined in section 19.5-22, article VII hereof, in said drilling block desire to join in said production unit and execute within said thirty (30) calendar day period pooling agreements on the same proportionate basis and containing terms and conditions as the pooling agreements executed by other mineral interest owners in said production unit, such adjoining drilling block shall become a part of the production unit. If fifty-one (51) percent or less of the mineral interest owners in said adjoining drilling block executes such pooling agreements within said time, the same shall not be required to be included within the production unit proposed to be formed by the operator. 
(3)  All mineral interests in each production unit, whether the production unit consists of a single drilling block or more than one (1) drilling block, shall be unitized as herein provided as to each horizon from which production is obtained. 
(4)  Production units may be formed or declared for all depths or for separate horizons. 
(5)  The planning department shall be provided a survey plat for each drilling block contained in the production unit, as well as a survey plat of the boundaries of the entire production unit. A statement as to horizons governed by the production unit and a copy of the mineral interest ownership setting out percentages of ownership for the production unit will be filed with the planning department by the time of commencement of production. 
(6)  Well density within the production unit will not exceed one (1) well per drilling block per producing horizon unless an increase in well density is permitted by the railroad commission. 
(7)  In all cases where a production unit is formed composed of acreage in more than one (1) drilling block, but the drilling permit only covers one (1) drilling block, all of the above requirements shall be met by applying for an amended drilling permit and receiving such amended permit before proceeding further with drilling or production operations.

e.  A certificate of existence of public liability insurance in the amounts set out in section 19.5-132 of this chapter; 
f.  Date of RRC permit and copy of latest order of RRC pertaining to such well. 
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 1, 3-18-2014) 
Sec. 19.5-86. - Abandonment procedures. 
(a)  Whenever any well is abandoned, it shall be the obligation of the operator to plug such well in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, the rules of the RRC, the procedures outlined in this chapter, and/or any other agency having jurisdiction in connection with the abandonment or plugging of such well. The operator shall submit to the planning department forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the plugging operation a notice of intent to plug and abandon, which will include the abandonment program and a request for release of permit. The abandonment operations shall be conducted in such a manner as to prevent well fluids from reaching the surface or contaminating subsurface fresh water zones. The abandonment action shall not occur on any Saturday, Sunday, or city holiday. 
(b)  Where enough of the producing or protective casing has been removed from the well to expose the shoe of the surface casing, then a two-hundred-foot cement plug shall be placed opposite the shoe of the surface casing to extend at least one hundred (100) feet upwards from the shoe of the surface casing. Sufficient time shall be allowed for this cement to harden enough so that it will sustain the weight of drill pipe or tubing to this depth. The operator shall feel for the top of the plug to determine that the top is at least one hundred (100) feet above the shoe of the surface casing and is of sufficient hardness to hold the weight of the drill pipe or tubing to this depth. If a mechanical bridge plug or cement retainer is used in the middle of the cement plug, it will not be required to feel for the top of the plug. In the event the top of the plug is not one hundred (100) feet upwards from the shoe, then a second cement application will be required and tested as above. After the plug at the shoe has been successfully completed, then a minimum fifty-foot cement plug shall be set at the surface, after which the casing shall be cut off a minimum of five (5) feet below the surface of the ground and a one-half (1/2) inch steel plate welded over the top. A two-inch galvanized pipe shall be screwed into this collar so as to extend upwards three (3) feet above the surface. The location shall then be backfilled and leveled. 
(c)  Where the protective or producing string of casing to be left in the well extends upwards from the shoe of the surface casing so as to prevent the above-described method of abandonment, then the following procedure will be used. A packer of cast-iron cement retainer shall be set in the surface casing fifty (50) feet above the top of any other casing within the surface casing and sufficient cement shall then be squeezed below the packer or retainer to theoretically extend to one hundred (100) feet below the shoe of the surface casing and fill that portion up to the packer or retainer with the cement. The packer or retainer will be left in the well. A surface plug, as described above, will then be set and abandonment completed in the same manner as described in paragraph (b) above. 
(d)  Where well conditions prevent plugging of the well in accordance with above paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the operator shall plug and abandon such well using any alternate method which may be proposed by the operator and approved by the planning department. 
(e)  The planning department shall witness all plugging and abandonments and certify in writing that the abandonment was or was not in accordance with the above procedure. No permit will be released without certification that the plugging and abandonment was successfully accomplished in accordance with the above procedure. A plugging certificate will be issued by the planning department and a copy forwarded to the operator or owner of the plugged well. 
(f)  When a well has been plugged and abandoned in accordance with the above procedures and the permittee is entitled to a release of permit, the planning department will affix a proper identification marking to the two (2) inch riser, as required in paragraph (b) of this section, and make an office record thereof, so that ready reference to the office files will reflect the exact location of the well, date of abandonment, and condition of well at time of abandonment. It shall be unlawful to remove such marking or riser unless a permit to remove same is approved by the planning department. 
(g)  Whenever operations under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are employed, then the following further requirements will be complied with: 
(1)  When casing is to be shot or cut off and pulled, a blowout preventer equipped to completely blank off the well bore and close off around the casing to be pulled shall be installed and tested prior to shooting or cutting off the casing. 
(2)  In all cases prior to cutting any casing, the annulus between the casing to be recovered and the surface string of casing will be tested to determine whether this annulus is dead or pressured. In the event it is pressured, no casing will be recovered until this pressure is released to zero and the annulus filled with mud-laden fluid of sufficient density to maintain zero surface pressure. 
(3)  The well shall have a safety valve installed on the top of the casing string before any casing is shot or cut-off. This safety valve shall not be removed until the first joint of casing has been pulled and shall then be kept immediately at hand so that it may be reinstalled, if needed. 
(4)  The well shall be completely filled at all times with mud-laden fluid of sufficient density to prevent the entrance of formation fluids which would jeopardize well control during all casing and tubing operations. Periodic checks will be made of the mud fluid during displacing operations. 
(5)  The operator shall have a responsible representative at the well site during the setting and tagging of cement plugs and during the casing pulling operations to ensure that the procedures outlined in the notice of intent to plug and abandon filed with the RRC are complied with and to ensure that other provisions of this chapter are complied with.

    Two (2) dually controlled, hydraulically activated blowout preventers with a manually operated lock with working-pressure rating equal to the maximum anticipated wellhead pressure, but at least equal to the minimum internal yield-pressure rating of the casing to which it is connected, shall be used for all drilling or completion operations involving the use of drill pipe or tubing after the surface casing has been set. For wells drilled to depths below nine thousand (9,000) feet, a Hydril-type blowout preventer shall be used in addition to the two (2) dually controlled blowout preventers above specified. The mechanical operation of the blowout preventers shall be checked a minimum of every twenty-four (24) hours and pressure-tested prior to installation on each casing string at least once a week thereafter during the drilling and completing point. A choke manifold having the same working-pressure rating as the preventers will be installed below the blowout preventer stack. In addition, the drilling rig, as part of its inventory, will have inside blowout preventers for each size and thread of tubing or drill pipe to be used in the drilling of said test well and any other type of safety equipment commonly used in the industry that may be requested by the superintendent. It is required that, upon obtaining a depth of three hundred (300) feet, a conductor lining or pipe be set and cemented to the bore hole throughout to the surface with attachment of adequate blowout preventers and testing thereof prior to drilling further. This shall be performed in the presence of the planning department and subject to any additional requirements which they may impose in this regard. Upon the witnessing by the planning department of such procedures, drilling operations may be continued. In the event the planning department is satisfied that the returns of cement to the surface cannot be obtained, then the planning department may approve alternate remedial procedures. 
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 1, 3-18-2014) 
Sec. 19.5-102. - Surface casing. 
    All operators commencing drilling operations on a new well shall be required to set and cement a sufficient amount of surface casing to properly protect all fresh-water sands in accordance with the requirements of the Texas Water Development Board and any other governmental agency having jurisdiction. The length of surface casing shall in no case be less than fifteen hundredths (0.15) of the length of the next string of pipe proposed to be set. The surface casing shall be new or used casing, inspected and pressure-tested to have a minimum internal yield value, as defined by the API formula, of at least the product of one and zero tenths (1.0) pounds per square inch times the total depth of which the surface casing is set and shall be cemented by the pump-and-plug method. A volume of cement shall be used which, according to accepted engineering procedures, is calculated to fill the annular space between the surface casing and well bore to the surface of the ground. The cement will be circulated with the pump until the returns of cement are observed at the surface of the ground, and the cement shall be allowed to stand for a period sufficient to develop one thousand (1,000) pounds per square inch (psi) compressive strength before the plug is drilled. If cement does not circulate to the surface, then a temperature survey shall be conducted to determine the depth reached by the cement, and at such time such remedial procedures shall be followed as directed by the planning department. As to wells above four thousand (4,000) feet, the planning department shall have the authority to grant exceptions to the surface casing requirements, provided that the exception is based on written findings that include documentation as to the presence of protective measures that mitigate impacts to the public health and safety.

Such expense will only cover the cost of materials and supplies required, and the services of individuals or firms specializing in the controlling of wells including the directional drilling and similar operations necessary to bring the wells under control. A well shall be deemed out of control only so long as there is a continuous flow of drilling fluid, oil, gas or water above the surface of the ground which is uncontrollable. Such bond shall inure to the benefit of the city and shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney and shall be in the amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00).

ARTICLE VII. - UNITIZATION 

Sec. 19.5-146. - Purpose. 
    In order to facilitate the orderly development of oil and gas production in the city and to avoid confiscation of property, owners of oil and gas interests permitted to be unitized in article II shall be given the opportunity to participate in the production of oil and gas from the drilling block in which their property is located subject to the rules provided in this article and article II of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 1, 3-18-2014) 
Sec. 19.5-147. - Procedure for unitization. 
    The procedure outlined herein for the unitization of oil and gas interests is not intended to be an exclusive method for unitizing such interests. Voluntary unitization is authorized and encouraged as a substitute for the procedures outlined herein. A voluntary unitization agreement between the various owners will satisfy the unitization requirements contained in this chapter insofar as they relate to those owners signing said unitization agreement. If voluntary agreements cannot be reached with all of the owners of oil and gas interests within the drilling block to be unitized, the procedure for unitizing all interests in such drilling block or blocks not voluntarily unitized or owned by the applicant shall be as follows: 
(a)  The applicant shall file application to drill in accordance with the terms and provisions of article IV hereof, including the names and addresses of all owners of operating rights within the production block or blocks covered by the application. 
(b)  Owners of operating rights shall be entitled to the following options: 
(1)  Mineral fee owner. A mineral fee owner of an oil and gas interest not covered by an existing oil and gas lease shall be entitled to participate as a royalty owner on the basis of: 
a.  One-sixth ( 1/6 ) royalty; or 
b.  One-eighth ( 1/8 ) royalty plus a bonus equal to the highest bonus paid by the operator in the production block where the mineral interest to be unitized is situated. 
    Such election is to be made in a letter addressed to the planning department before the permit is approved by the city council. If no letter is received, it will be considered that the owner has elected subsection a. above. In addition, said mineral fee owner shall be entitled to elect between the options available to the lessee as referenced in subsection (b)(2) below; however, if said mineral fee owner fails to elect between the options available to the lessee within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of publication of the notice required in section 19.5-148, they shall be conclusively presumed to have elected to participate under a royalty clause as provided above. If any such mineral owner owns an interest in the oil and gas on, in and under said land less than the entire fee simple oil and gas mineral estate, then the royalty participation of such mineral owner, and such owner's share of participation as an operating owner or as a carried interest owner under either Option No. 1 or 2 below, shall be reduced in the proportion that their interest bears to the whole and undivided fee and in accordance with the nature of the estate of which they are seized. 
(2)  Lessee. The lessee shall be entitled to elect between the following options: 
    Option No. 1. The lessee may elect within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of posting said notice to participate in the drilling and production of the well as an active operating interest owner, in which event they shall pay their proportionate share of all drilling and operating costs and shall participate in production in proportion to this ownership in the production block. If such owner elects to participate as an operating owner, they shall either post bond, written by an approved bonding company as provided in section 19.5-135, or deposit cash with the applicant guaranteeing payment to the applicant of such operating interest owner's proportionate share on a surface acreage basis of the following amounts: 
a.  The estimated cost of drilling and completing the well; and 
b.  The estimated monthly operating expenses. 
    If the cost of drilling and completing the well exceeds the estimated cost, such owner shall forthwith on demand pay their proportionate share of the excess to the applicant, or if the actual costs are less than the estimate, such owner's proportionate share of the difference shall be refunded by the applicant on demand. Such operating interest owner shall advance to the applicant, at monthly or other mutually acceptable intervals, such owner's share of estimated expenses of operating the production unit or, at the election of applicant, such owner's share of the operating expenses may be deducted by the applicant from revenues from production which otherwise would be payable to such owner as such expenses accrue. 
    Option No. 2. The lessee may elect to become the owner of a carried interest. If the lessee elects to be a carried interest owner, they shall not be entitled to receive any revenue from their interest in the production block until such time as the participating owners have received from the proceeds of production attributable to said carried interest owner's leasehold interest an amount equal to their proportionate share of current operating expenses, the cost of purchasing and installing all pipelines, tank batteries and other equipment installed by the participating owners to facilitate production of oil and gas from said production block, and an amount equal to twice said carried interest owner's proportionate share of the cost of drilling and completing a well drilled on said production block. The interest of such a carried interest owner shall be subject to its proportionate share of all operating costs incurred by the operating owners and properly allocable to the production block in accordance with accepted accounting practices. Any remaining income attributable to said carried interest shall be payable to the owner thereof monthly. 
    If a lessee fails to elect to participate under one (1) of the two (2) options shown above within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of posting notice to such interest owner of operator's intent to unitize said unit, then and in that event such lessee shall be presumed to have elected to participate as a carried interest owner under Option 2 above. The operator shall furnish the lessee, upon the lessee's request, copies of their authority for expenditure for the drilling and completion of said well and an estimate of monthly operating expenses. In addition, the operator shall furnish the lessee an operating agreement under which the operator will be designated as "operator," and such operating agreement will have an accounting procedure attached to it and made a part thereof. 
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 1, 3-18-2014) 
Sec. 19.5-148. - Notice to owners; form; publication. 
(a)  Notice will be given to the owners whose addresses are known or are ascertainable by use of ordinary diligence. It will be presumed that an operator has used ordinary diligence if they have checked the city tax records to obtain the address listed therein for the owner of the oil and gas interests within the affected drilling and production block or blocks which are not under lease to the applicant and which are not covered by voluntary unitization agreements. 
(b)  Notice shall be given as follows: 
(1)  The applicant shall deliver or send by certified mail to all such owners, at their last known address, a written notice which shall include the following: 
a.  A legal description of the proposed drilling block, production block or production unit. 
b.  The drilling block number in which the proposed well is to be located. 
c.  Type of interest held by the owner being notified (royalty under existing lease, mineral fee, lessee, overriding royalty, etc.). 
d.  A statement of the options available to the owner being notified, if any, as set out in this article at section 19.5-147, if applicable. 
e.  Notification that if the owner fails to notify the applicant in writing within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of posting of said notice to each owner of the selection of one (1) of the available options, the owner will be conclusively presumed to have elected to participate as a carried interest owner as set out in section 19.5-147(b), and if a mineral owner, under section 19.5-147(b)(1)a. 
(2)  In addition to the individual notification provided for above, the applicant will cause to be published in the newspaper published in the city a notice in substantial compliance with the following form: 
    "Notice is hereby given that (name) of (address), as applicant, pursuant to the provisions of the Oil and Gas Drilling Ordinance of the City of Eagle Pass, will, on or about the ________ day of _________, 20__, file with the City Planning Department, an application for a permit to drill and/or operate a well, upon Drilling Block No. ________, and Production Block No. ________, a general description of which are as follows:

Owners of operating rights in land to be unitized have the option of (1) participating in the drilling and production of the well as active operating interest owners, or (2) becoming a carried interest owner. Owners who do not notify the applicant in writing of their election of one (1) of the options available within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of this publication will be conclusively presumed to have elected to participate as a carried interest owner as provided in section 19.5-147(b) of the City of Eagle Pass Code of Ordinances."

(Ord. No. 05-22, § 1, 8-2-2005) 
Secs. 23-49-23-59. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS 

Sec. 23-60. - General principles of acceptability. 
(a)  Conformity to master development plan. The subdivision shall conform to the master development plan of the city and parts thereof. 
(b)  Provision for future subdivision. If a tract is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the opening of future streets and logical further development. 
(c)  Reserved strips prohibited. Reserved strips controlling access to land dedicated or intended to be dedicated to public use shall be deposited except where their control is definitely placed in the city under conditions approved by the planning commission. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider/developer/owner of land being platted or replatted to ensure that there are not reserved strips controlling access to land dedicated or intended to be dedicated to public use. 
(d)  Suitable building sites. Every lot must contain a suitable building site. 
(e)  Suitability of land use. Land within municipal boundaries shall be suited to the purpose for which it is to be used. 
(f)  Site improvements. Streets, alleys, sidewalks and other site improvements required under the provisions of this chapter to be installed in subdivisions by the subdivider shall conform to the specifications of this chapter and to the then-current policies and regulations of the City of Eagle Pass and the city water works system. All plans and specifications for site improvements shall be approved in writing by the city manager and planning commission in accordance with the design criteria and construction standards of the Master Development Plan of the City of Eagle Pass and the provisions of this chapter. If any part of the plans and specifications submitted to the city manager by the subdivider for proposed construction of site improvements are considered unsatisfactory by the city manager and the commission, construction shall not be commenced by the subdivider on the affected portions until alterations are made by the subdivider as requested by the city manager and the commission, so that the completed work shall comply with the above cited standards. 
(Ord. No. 05-22, § 1, 8-2-2005) 
Sec. 23-61. - Streets. 
(a)  Street layout. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the master development plan of the city and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public safety and convenience, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. The street layout shall be devised for the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood development. If the right-of-way or pavement width required by the city comprehensive plan is in excess of the minimum right-of-way or pavement width or base called for in section ___________ subparagraph ___________ of this same part, then the subdivider may request the participation of the city in the additional costs which would be required for residential street construction. In any such instance, a written contract with the city is required as part of the application for final plat approval. Said written contract shall be considered as part of the application for final plat along with the other information and data required by the subdivision ordinance. 
(1)  Where such is not shown in the city comprehensive plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
a.  Provide for the continuation of appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or 
b.  Conform to a plan for the neighborhood to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable. 
(2)  Minor streets on which single-family housing is the majority use shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged, and that significant amounts of internal traffic will not be generated. 
(3)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the commission may require: 
a.  Marginal-access streets; 
b.  Reverse frontage with screen planting contained in nonacess strips along the rear property line; 
c.  Deep lots with rear service alleys, and/or minimum distances between intersecting driveways and street, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
Arterial Street Speed (mph) Minimum Separation in Feet 20 85 25 105 30 125 35 150 40 185 45 230 55 800  
(b)  Relation to adjoining streets. Where necessary to the neighborhood pattern, existing principal or major streets in adjoining areas shall be continued, and shall be at least as wide as such existing streets and in alignment therewith. Where streets change design in alignment and width, an appropriate transition shall be provided for safe and efficient traffic flow. 
(c)  Projection of streets. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into such unsubdivided areas. 
(d)  [Curve radius.] When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one (1) point by more than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to ensure a minimum sight distance as shown in the table below; however, the commission reserves the right to require a greater radius in special cases to ensure safety. 
Safe Sight Distance Minimum Requirements For Horizontal Curves 
Street Type Minimum Requirement (feet) Arterial 1,000 Collector 800 Minor 600 Marginal-Access 500  
(e)  Half streets or adjacent streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except in most unusual circumstances, where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of this chapter and where the commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Where the proposed subdivision abuts upon an existing half street, the other remaining half of the street shall be platted within such subdivision. Existing half streets shall be improved in compliance with the city standards specified by this chapter. 
(f)  Street intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practicable, giving due regard to terrain and topography. No two-way street shall intersect another street at less than sixty (60) degrees. The planning commission may permit intersection angles of forty-five (45) degrees on one-way streets, if sufficient width is provided at the intersection to permit safe merging of traffic. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of twenty (20) feet, or of a greater radius where the commission may deem it necessary. The commission may permit corner cutoffs of a minimum of fifteen (15) feet set back from projected property line intersection, upon the recommendation of the public works director. 
(g)  Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited except as short stubs (not exceeding the depth of one (1) lot or one hundred fifty (150) feet, whichever is greater) to permit future expansion. A "short stub" is defined as being the length of the adjacent lot depth. 
(h)  Cul-de-sac streets. In general, cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed six hundred (600) feet in length, and shall have a turnaround of not less than one hundred (100) feet in diameter in residential areas, and not less than two hundred (200) feet in diameter in commercial and industrial areas. Where there is not sufficient fall, inverted concrete crowns shall be construed at each of these sites, with concrete swales of a minimum of eight (8) feet in width, so that all water shall be directed towards the center, then to be drained in the direction of the current. If the water drains towards undeveloped land, the subdivider shall be required to provide a drainage easement to the City of Eagle Pass in recordable form approved by the city attorney at no cost to said city. The commission will accept or reject a plan with longer cul-de-sac streets based on its merits after considering density, land use, safety and convenience. 
(i)  Marginal access streets from major thoroughfares to subdivision lots. Where a subdivision has frontage on an arterial street, there shall be provided a marginal access street on both sides or on the subdivision side of the arterial street, unless the adjacent lots back up to the arterial street, or unless the commission determines that such marginal access streets are not desirable under the facts of a particular case for adequate protection of the lots and separation of through and local traffic. 
    In addition, where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the planning commission may require reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic for effective traffic control. 
(j)  Non-access easement. When deemed necessary, a vehicular non-access easement may be required on a lot or lots for the purpose of controlling ingress and egress to vehicular traffic. 
(k)  Streets on development plan. Where a subdivision embraces a principal or secondary street as shown on the master development plan of the city, such principal or secondary street shall be platted in the location and of the width indicated by the requirements of the master development plan and dedicated to the city on said plat. 
    Where such is not shown in the master development plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
(1)  Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or 
(2)  Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the planning commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable. 
(l)  Minor local streets. Minor streets shall be laid out so as to discourage their use by through traffic and high speed traffic. Minor streets, however, should be reasonably accessible from collector streets to ensure prompt access by emergency vehicles and other essential services. 
(m)  Pavement width, rights-of-way width, and construction standards. 
(1)  Definitions. 
    Principal arterials: U.S., state, or county highways which carry the major portion of trips entering or leaving the city, as well as the majority of through movements desiring to bypass the central city. Service to abutting land is secondary to the provision of travel service to major traffic movements. 
    Minor arterials: Major intracity streets which interconnect and augment the principal arterial system and provide service to smaller geographical areas than do the principal arterials. 
    Collectors: Streets which penetrate neighborhoods, collect traffic from local streets, and channel it onto the arterial system. A small amount of through traffic may be carried on collector streets, but the primary purpose is to provide land access service and carry local traffic movements within residential, commercial, or industrial areas. 
    Local residential: Streets which provide direct access to abutting land and access to the higher systems, primarily to the collector system. Through traffic is deliberately discouraged, and traffic volumes originating within the system should not be great. 
    Access or service roads: A marginal-access street used adjacent to arterial streets in order to provide traffic control to the abutting land development. 
(2)  [Right-of-way widths.] The subdivider shall dedicate all interior streets within the subdivision. Street right-of-way widths shall be not less than as follows: 
Street Type Right-of-Way* 
(Feet) Paving Width 
(Feet) Arterials 80-150 60-120 Collectors 60-80 42-60 Minor 50-60 30-40 Marginal Access or Service Roads 30-40 24  
* Exact width of the right-of-way shall be dependent upon the length of the street, the traffic-generating potential of land development, and public utility or storm drainage requirements. 
(3)  Construction standards. 
a.  All streets shall be constructed with respect to base, surfacing, curbs and geometric design criteria in accordance with the standards and specifications of the master development plan of the city and the regulations set forth herein, and shall be subject to the inspection and approval by the city manager. Samples of caliche shall be required to be laboratory tested prior to initiation of construction. All costs incurred in meeting this requirement shall be borne by the subdivider. 
b.  No trees or shrubs shall be planted within a street right-of-way. No structures shall be placed within a street right-of-way. Within key areas where beautification is desired, street trees may be permitted if approved by the Public Works Department, but must not impede driver and pedestrian sight lines. 
(4)  Adjacent streets. The subdivider shall dedicate right-of-way width and provide pavement width of streets forming part of an adjacent subdivision as required in the master development plan. 
(5)  Existing streets. Where the proposed subdivision includes or abuts upon an existing half street, the subdivider shall dedicate right-of-way sufficient to make the full right-of-way width conform to this chapter, and there shall be paved so much of such right-of-way as to make the full pavement width comply with this chapter. Before any pavement is laid to widen existing pavement, the existing pavement shall be cut back to two (2) feet to assure an adequate sub-base and pavement joint. 
(6)  Railroad right-of-way. Where a subdivision borders on, or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in the appropriate district. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(n)  Curbs. Curbs shall be required and installed by the subdivider on both sides of all interior streets and on the subdivision side of adjacent streets. The curb shall be of concrete using the ratio of four (4) sacks of cement to one (1) yard of sand, and shall not be less than eighteen (18) inches wide, and shall be installed over a compacted caliche base of not less than eight (8) inches in depth. Samples of caliche shall be required to be laboratory tested by the subdivider prior to the initiation of construction, at no cost to the City of Eagle Pass. 
(o)  Street names. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or cause confusion with the names of existing streets, unless the new street is a continuation of or in alignment with an existing street. Names of new streets shall be subject to approval of the commission. 
(p)  Street lights. All new subdivisions (excluding replats) shall be provided with street lighting, and a plan for the installation of street lighting shall be presented by the property owner to the commission. Minimum lighting standards shall be as follows: 
(1)  Arterial streets, twenty-seven thousand (27,000) lumens approximately every three hundred (300) feet of street length. 
(2)  All other streets, sixteen thousand (16,000) lumens approximately every three hundred (300) feet of street length. 
(3)  Minor variations in positioning of lamp poles due to lot and block configuration may be allowable with the approval of the commission. 
(4)  On streets that serve as exterior boundaries of the subdivision, the commission may allow alternate spacings for lamp poles, where the adjacent land can be expected to develop and provide for its alternate half of the street lighting. 
(5)  Installation and the first year's electricity costs shall be borne by the owner and considered as a utility cost for bonding requirements or alternative guarantees as may be allowed. 
(q)  Street name signs. Within the city limits and within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction, the subdivider, at his sole cost and expense, shall provide and install street name signs bearing also the number of the block at all intersections within and abutting the subdivision. In addition, the subdivider shall provide and install at his sole cost and expense traffic-control signs at locations designated by the city manager. All such name and traffic-control signs shall be of a type approved by the city, and shall be installed in accordance with the standards of the city. Street name signs and traffic-control signs shall not be installed until the street has been accepted for maintenance by the city, unless approved by the city manager to provide mail service. 
(r)  [Street grades.] Street grades, wherever feasible, shall conform to the list below, with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves and the proper storm drainage. 
Street Type Maximum % Grade Minimum % Grade Arterial 6.0 0.20 Collector 6.25 0.20 Minor 7.0 0.20 Access/Service Roads 8.5 0.20  
Proposed street grades shall be approved by the commission, with due regard being had for topography, contemplated land use, and the general drainage plan and facilities in the area surrounding the area subdivided. 
(s)  [Street crown.] The crown of all streets shall be based on three-eighths of an inch per foot of street width, but in no case less than four (4) inches nor more than eight (8) inches. All alleys shall have an inverted crown on one-eighth of an inch per foot of alley width, but in no case less than three (3) inches nor more than five (5) inches. 
(t)  Laboratory testing. All materials to be used in new land development construction shall be subject to testing if warranted. The preponderance of testing to be performed in new developments is directly related to public improvement construction, and a series of laboratory tests normally associated with public improvement construction will be required in new developments. Said tests shall be performed by an independent testing laboratory using qualified personnel. 
    The testing laboratory may be selected by the developer no more than five working days from the date of final plat approval by the planning and zoning commission. Selection shall be submitted to the city engineer in writing from a list of testing laboratories approved by the city. In the event no qualified laboratory is selected within the specified time period, the testing laboratory shall be selected by the city from the approved list on a rotational basis. 
    Changing of laboratory firm, once selected, shall be prohibited. If unforeseen circumstances arise, and an alternative laboratory is required, the replacement laboratory shall be selected by the city engineer from the list of approved laboratories on a rotational basis. 
    The testing laboratory shall bill directly to the developer. 
    It is assumed that the preponderance of testing required in the development is that testing related directly to street construction. For this reason, the following ratio of testing is established: 
Ratio of Testing: Subgrade Minimum 1 per 150 feet of street  Under curb and gutter Minimum 1 per 150 feet of curb  Caliche base Minimum 1 per 150 feet of street  Lime stabilized base Minimum 1 per 150 feet of street  Sand base Minimum 1 per 150 feet of street  Backfill density control Minimum of 10  
Proctor (Moisture/Density Relationship):  Subgrade (new) 1 per development, unless material changes  Lime stabilized base 1 per development, unless material changes  Caliche 1 per 5,000 cubic yards material or less  
Atterberg Limits and Gradation:  Caliche 1 per 5,000 cubic yards material  Sand base 1 per 2,500 cubic yards material  
Hot-Mix Control:  Surface course design 1 per development  Base course design 1 per development  Extractions 2 per day run/minimum 1 per 500 ton  Densities (in place) 1 per 1,000 feet of street  
Concrete:  Curb/gutter 1 set (3) per 500 feet  Sidewalk 1 set (3) per 4,000 square feet  Inlets 1 set (3) per 6 inlets  
The above schedule is a minimum schedule for testing, failures are not included. In the event of failures, additional tests will be taken. If excessive rain occurs on a previously tested section, the city shall have the right to order re-testing as necessary. 
The contractor shall notify the city public works director at least twenty-four (24) hours prior that he is ready for testing, and the city's representative shall inspect the work and concur with the contractor before testing can be authorized. The public works director or its representative shall notify the testing laboratory when tests are to be taken. In the event that neither the city public works director nor his/her representative is available for inspection of the work within four (4) hours, the contractor may order the laboratory testing. Provided, however, in the event of failures, retesting shall be at the contractor's expense. Except as otherwise provided above, it is the intent of the city that the contractor not contact the laboratory for the purpose of requesting routine test. The scope of materials incorporated in new development construction is not necessarily limited to those tests outlined herewith. In the event of unusual conditions or factors which may give the city reason to question the quality of the materials in any portion of the development, the city will have the right to order such tests as are necessary at the developer's expense. However, the city will consult with the project engineer on reasons for such additional tests before a testing laboratory will be asked to conduct such test.

a.  Block lengths may be waived by the planning and zoning commission for commercial developments. 
b.  To request a waiver from the one thousand two hundred foot block length requirement traffic impact mitigation measures must be incorporated into a site plan, submitted as part of and subject to approval along with the plat by the planning and zoning commission. 
c.  No waiver may be granted by the planning and zoning commission unless traffic impact mitigation measures comply with standards (herein adopted as minimum standards) of the Institute of Transportation Engineers. No waiver may be granted which modifies the any of the city's comprehensive plan or thoroughfare plan of the comprehensive plan addressing thoroughfares, highways, arterials, and collectors, or of the proper extension of any street. 
d.  Where any conflict exists between the Institute of Transportation Engineers Standards and the comprehensive plan, the stricter of the two (2) shall apply. 
(b)  Lots: 
(1)  The size, width, depth, shape and orientation of lots and the minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated and in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Eagle Pass. The subdividing of the land shall be such lot with satisfactory access to an existing public street. 
(2)  Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the existing zoning ordinances of the city, and in addition thereto:

c.  The depth and width of properties reserved for or laid out for business or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for off-street parking and service facilities required by the type of use and development proposed. 
(3)  The commission shall have authority to set higher minimum standard requirements in the following instances: 
a.  Where lots conforming to the minimum requirements would disrupt the essential character of the neighborhood. 
b.  Where lots conforming to the minimum requirements, in relation to existing or planned adjacent properties conforming to a larger spacing, would be so small as to cause substantial injury to such adjacent properties by decreasing the market value thereof or otherwise. 
c.  Where lots conforming to the minimum requirements would be inconsistent with the master development plan or good neighborhood planning. 
d.  Where lot widths or area as proposed would have adverse affects on health or welfare due to unusual topographic conditions, or soil conditions relative to proper functioning of any planned septic tank or water system. 
If the commission shall determine that any or all of the above conditions exist, it may increase the minimum requirements as to area or width so that, in the judgment of the commission, the adverse conditions will be abated. 
(4)  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries, or to overcome specific disadvantages or topography and orientation.

And further, adjacent to such high pressure lines, a twenty-five-foot building limit line (measured at right angles from the center line of the fuel line) shall be shown on the final plat. In any case in which there is an existing fuel line easement, then the twenty-five-foot building limit line shall be measured at right angles from the center line of said easement. 
(8)  Lot grading: 
a.  Lot grading in developments will be such that lots drain toward the street. Accordingly, all lots graded within developments will be sloped such that a minimum grade of one-half of one (0.5) percent exists from the property lines to the rear of the lot. In the event it is not practical to drain lots to the street (rear to front) then an alternate drainage plan may be submitted for approval by the City of Eagle Pass Public Works Department. 
b.  If drainage from adjacent property crosses such development, drainage from adjacent property will be physically diverted to adequate drainage facilities or handled with the runoff from the development itself. 
c.  A lot grading plan showing the finish floor elevation of the proposed structure shall be made part of the final plans and shall be considered an improvement for the development. Construction of same shall be a condition precedent to the final acceptance of the development by the city engineer.

(Ord. No. 05-22, § 1, 8-2-2005) 
ARTICLE V. - PARKLAND DEDICATION 

Sec. 23-75. - Purpose. 
    The Eagle Pass City Council has determined that recreational areas in the form of public parks are necessary and benefit the well being of the citizens of Eagle Pass. The council has further determined that a reasonable procedure for establishing such parks is the integration of a parkland dedication requirement into the procedure for subdividing property within the city limits or extraterritorial jurisdiction of Eagle Pass. All single family and multifamily residential subdivisions, therefore, shall be required to comply with the ordinance. It is the intention of this chapter to provide for quality parkland and improvements to those parklands; through either parkland property dedication or parkland cash contributions in lieu of property dedication. The city desires to provide sizable, high quality parkland sites for the use and enjoyment of its citizens. It is intended that such sites be easily accessible to all citizens of Eagle Pass and easily maintained by city work forces. The director of parks and recreation may recommend to the planning and zoning commission that a proposed parkland site dedication is unacceptable and may require parkland cash contributions in lieu of parkland property dedication. Such payments in lieu of parkland property dedication will be based upon the following criteria. 
(Ord. No. 05-22, § 1, 8-2-2005) 
Sec. 23-76. - Definitions. 
(a)  Public parks are large tracts of land usually with grass and trees improved for public use and recreation with at least sixty (60) percent of flat land for use of ball fields. 
(b)  Major residential subdivisions are defined in this subsection as subdivisions with fifty (50) or more proposed dwelling units. 
(c)  Minor residential subdivisions are those subdivisions with fewer than fifty (50) proposed dwelling units. 
(d)  Parkland is the actual property on which the public park will be situated. It is also refereed to as the property to be dedicated by the property owner to the city pursuant to City parkland dedication requirements. 
(e)  Cash contribution is an equivalent cash value contribution to the city for parkland property acquisition or parkland improvement costs in lieu of dedication of actual parkland property. 
(f)  Parkland contribution is the actual dedication of parkland property to the city by way of plat note and general warranty deed. 
(g)  Parkland improvements are those improvements to the city owned parkland that allow the parkland to be utilized as public parks. 
(h)  Ultimate residents are residents projected to live in a subdivision at the time of completion. 
(Ord. No. 05-22, § 1, 8-2-2005) 
Sec. 23-77. - Criteria for land dedication. 
(a)  Eligibility of subdivisions for parkland dedication requirements. 
(1)  Minor subdivisions. The developer of any subdivision classified as a minor subdivision shall not be required to dedicate parkland. The developer of minor subdivisions shall pay cash contribution in lieu of parkland dedication calculated pursuant to subsection (5)(c). However, if the developer feels he has parkland area that would be advantageous to the city, he may submit a request for dedicating parkland to the city and the city shall have the option of accepting parkland property dedication or the cash contribution. 
(2)  Major subdivisions. The developer of any subdivision classified as a major subdivision may be required to dedicate parkland. During the preliminary plat approval process, the developer shall designate a location for the proposed park (see parkland dedication requirements). To meet the intent of the chapter, one larger park rather than several small ones spread over the subdivision may be required. At this time the planning and zoning commission will decide whether or not the proposed property dedication would be consistent with the desires of the city in terms of quality and location of its parklands. Should the director of parks and recreation decide that the parkland is not desirable, and then the developer shall pay cash contribution in lieu of parkland dedication calculated pursuant to subsection (5)(c). 
(b)  Properties not required to dedicate park land. 
(1)  All residential properties that are classified as minor subdivisions. 
(2)  The dedication of land or cash contributions shall not apply to existing lots within a recorded plat. All new lots within a replat or addition to an existing subdivision shall comply with the parkland dedication or cash contribution requirements as outlined in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 05-22, § 1, 8-2-2005) 
Sec. 23-78. - Park land dedication requirements. 
    The dedicated land shall follow the guidelines below: 
(a)  Land treatment. Following preliminary platting of the park land by the subdivider or developer, the subdivider or developer shall not cause or allow any fill material or construction debris to be dumped on the land (park site), excavate the soil, grade the site, remove or damage vegetation or otherwise physically disturb the site without written permission from the director of the parks and recreation department ("director"). The subdivider may issue no easements or other dedications. The director may allow the subdivider or developer to dump fill material and take other respective actions specified in subsection (p) when, at the discretion of the director, such action would be beneficial to the parkland. In all such cases the city shall provide a letter of permission to the respective subdivider or developer prior to the action in question. The property shall be considered and treated as parkland. 
(b)  Amount of land required. The amount of land required to be dedicated for parkland will be calculated at a rate of not less than eight (8) acres of parkland per one thousand (1,000) ultimate residents or an equivalent ratio thereof. The area of the park to be dedicated shall be measured and calculated to the curb line of any street within the subdivision bounding said park. Parkland must have a minimum of two hundred (200) feet of frontage on a dedicated public street. The following formula shall be used to determine the amount of parkland to be dedicated: 
8.0 × (No. Units) × (Persons/Units) = Acres to be dedicated 1,000  
(c)  Average number of persons per unit. The number of persons per unit shall be based on data compiled by the city and shall be reviewed and adjusted as necessary. The following figures represent the average number of persons per unit by current density categories, and shall be used to calculate parkland dedication: 
Gross Density Per Residential Land Persons Per Unit From 0 to 6 (Single Family) 3.6 Over 6 to 20 (Multifamily) 2.3  
(d)  Density for multifamily development. Where a subdivision plat is submitted for a multifamily residential development and information is not provided concerning the number of units, the city shall assume the highest density allowed in the district applied to the property. This assumed density might be adjusted to a figure provided by the developer if recorded as a restrictive covenant enforceable by the city and approved by the city attorney. 
(e)  Dedications of less than five (5) acres. When an area of less than five (5) acres is required to be dedicated, the city may elect to accept the land offered for dedication, or refuse the same and require the payment of fees in lieu thereof. 
(f)  Determining the optimum location for parks. When one or more development will be necessary to create a neighborhood park of sufficient size in the same area, the parks and recreation department director, prior to the time of preliminary plat approval, will work with the developers to define the optimum location of their dedication within their plats. Once a park site has been determined, adjacent property owners who develop around the park site will dedicate land on the existing site unless otherwise determined by the city council. 
(g)  Dedication of floodplain lands. No park land shall be submitted for approval by the city that falls within the 100-year flood plain or is a portion of any drainage or detention systems unless the planning and zoning commission determines after receiving a recommendation from the parks and recreation board, that the flood plain is desirable for recreation and the flood plain is left in its native condition with the exception of allowing vegetation to be pruned or maintained in a way consistent with the recreational uses and allowing installation of recreational improvements consistent with flood plain uses such as trails, picnic areas, etc. If it is determined that the native flood plain areas are useful for recreational purposes, up to twenty-five (25) percent of the land area maintained as native flood plain may be counted toward the park land requirements with the condition that the park land is at least two hundred (200) feet in width and that none of the park land is utilized for stormwater detention. 
(h)  Review of lands to be dedicated. All land intended for park purposes shall be inspected both on the plat and in the field by the director of parks and recreation who shall report to the chairman of the parks and recreation board, who shall make a recommendation to the planning and zoning commission as to the desirability of the parkland. If all or a portion of this land is determined to not be in the best interest of the city, the city may require a payment of money in lieu of land, or part land and part money. This will be determined by the city council after considering the recommendations of the parks and recreation board, the planning and zoning commission and the parks and recreation director. 
(i)  Placement of corner markers. The developer shall be obligated to place survey corner markers at all corners of the parkland, which have been located by a licensed and professional surveyor. The markers will be four (4) inch diameter PVC pipe recessed twelve (12) inches in the ground. They will contain a one-half (1/2) inch iron pipe or rebar and be filled with concrete flush with ground. 
(j)  Provision for sewer service to the park site. The developer shall be responsible for providing a six (6) inch sewer stub ten (10) feet behind the curb at a location acceptable to the director of public works or designee. The director of public works or designee will be required to approve such location in writing prior to final approval and release of fiscal requirements of said subdivision. The developer must demonstrate that there is sufficient wastewater utility line capacity available to serve the park. 
(k)  Provision for water supply to park site. The developer shall be responsible for providing a three-quarter (3/4) inch metered water supply located twelve (12) feet behind the curb at a location acceptable to the director of public works or designee. The director of public works or designee will be required to approve such location in writing prior to final approval and release of fiscal requirements of said subdivision. The developer must demonstrate that there is sufficient water utility line capacity available to serve the park. 
(l)  Provision for electricity supply to the park site. The developer shall be responsible for ensuring electricity shall be readily available at the park site and providing electrical lines at a location acceptable to the director of parks and recreation or designee. 
(m)  Designation on preliminary and final plats. Parkland to be conveyed as part of a subdivision application shall be designated on both preliminary and final plats and shown as "Parkland Dedicated to the City of Eagle Pass" with the acreage of the parkland also shown. The applicant shall show the area designated as parkland in the narrative portion of the plat where the subdivider or developer dedicates all easements, rights-of-way, etc. to the city and designate it as a lot. At the time the applicant requests the city to accept the subdivision improvements, the applicant shall deliver to the parks and recreation department the warranty deed conveying fee simple title of all park land shown on the final plat approved by the planning commission. Any violation of section 4(a) shall result in delay of city acceptance of the subdivision until restoration is made or until a restoration fee calculated at a rate of actual restoration costs + administrative and design costs + the value of damage done to trees and terrain is paid to the city. The director of parks and recreation shall calculate the value of damages and restoration fee. 
(n)  Park improvements by applicant. If the applicant proposes park improvements to fulfill some or all of the requirements of this subsection, the applicant shall provide a park plan with the submission of the subdivision plat. The park plan, as designed by a certified landscape architect, shall consist of a sealed plan drawing showing the entire park site, topographic contours and all proposed improvements including specifications for proposed equipment. It is the intent of this chapter that the applicant provides either parkland or a cash contribution instead of park improvements. Park improvements will be considered for compliance with this chapter only if it is the opinion of the planning commission, after considering a recommendation from the parks and recreation board, that the park improvements are more desirable than additional parkland dedication. The value of the park and recreational improvements together with any equipment located thereon, as approved by the city, shall be credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land otherwise required by this chapter. Any playground equipment and all other site improvements are required to be approved by the director of parks and recreation prior to approval of the park plan. Park and recreational facilities shall be in accord with principals and standards of the parks and recreation element of the current Eagle Pass Parks and Open Spaces Master Plan. All playground equipment and its installation must meet the safety standards set by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National Playground Safety Institute. 
(o)  Purchase of park lands by city. The city may, from time to time, decide to purchase land for parks in or near the area of actual or potential development. If the city does purchase parkland, subsequent park land dedication for that area shall be in cash only, unless otherwise permitted by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 05-22, § 1, 8-2-2005) 
Sec. 23-79. - Cash contribution in lieu of land dedication. 
(a)  Properties subject to cash contribution in lieu of land dedication. All residential properties that are to be subdivided or platted and that are not required to have parkland dedicated to the city are subject to cash in lieu donation. 
(b)  Properties not subject to cash contribution in lieu of land dedication.

(2)  The dedication of land or cash contribution shall not apply in the case of a replat of a plat, subdivision or addition or the resubdivision of existing single lots that received approval after the date in which any previous parkland/greenbelt dedication ordinances were in effect in which dedication of land or payment of fees for parkland may have been required. 
(c)  Payment schedules for cash contributions in lieu of parkland dedication. 
(1)  The director of parks and recreation shall recommend to the planning and zoning commission that developers of all minor subdivisions meet the parkland dedication guidelines with a cash contribution. The rate shall be set at a rate of five hundred seventy-five dollars ($575.00) per dwelling unit for single family; three hundred seventy-five dollars ($375.00) per dwelling unit for two-family; and three hundred seventy-five dollars ($375.00) per dwelling unit for multi-family. 
(2)  The director of parks and recreation shall recommend to the planning and zoning commission that developers of all major subdivisions meet the parkland dedication guidelines with a cash contribution. The rate shall be set at a rate of five hundred seventy-five dollars ($575.00) per dwelling unit for single family; three hundred seventy-five dollars ($375.00) per dwelling unit for two-family; and three hundred seventy-five dollars ($375.00) per dwelling unit for multi-family.

(Ord. No. 05-22, § 1, 8-2-2005) 
Sec. 23-80. - One-time building permit fee for new construction. 
(a)  One time fee. In addition to the fees or dedication required, a one-time fee of one dollar ($1.00) per one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) value will be assessed per building permit issued for new construction in a new or existing subdivision for a single family residential unit; for new construction in a new or existing subdivision for a two-family residential unit; for apartment buildings or any other residential unit above two (2) families, and for commercial and industrial buildings. 
(b)  Valuation of construction.

Sec. 27-125. - Applicability of capital recovery fees. 
(a)  This article shall be uniformly applicable to new development which occurs within the water service area. 
(b)  No new development shall be exempt from the assessment of capital recovery fees as defined in this article. However, the city council may pay fees from nonutility funds on behalf of any new development for reasons of general community welfare. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.05), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 27-126. - Capital recovery fees as conditions of development approval. 
    No application for new development shall be approved within the city without assessment of capital recovery fees pursuant to this article, and no water tap shall be issued and no building permit shall be issued unless the applicant has paid the capital recovery fees imposed by and calculated hereinunder. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.06), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 27-127. - Establishment of the water service area. 
(a)  The water service area is established as shown on the service area map which is Exhibit A for this article. 
(b)  The service areas shall be established consistent with any facility service area established in the CIP for the utility. Additions to the service area may be designated by the city council consistent with the procedure set forth in chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code, as amended, or any successor statute. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.07), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Editor's note- Exhibit A, referred to in § 27-127 above, has not been included herein, but can be found on file for inspection in the city secretary's office. 
Sec. 27-128. - Land use assumptions. 
    Land use assumptions used in the development of the capital recovery fees are contained in Exhibit A of this article. These assumptions may be revised by the city council according to the procedure set forth in chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code, as amended, or any successor statute. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.08), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Editor's note- Exhibit A, referred to in § 27-128 above, has not been included herein, but can be found on file for inspection in the city secretary's office. 
Sec. 27-129. - Service units. 
(a)  Establish in accordance with standards. Service units are established in accordance with generally accepted engineering and planning standards. 
(b)  Calculation. Service units shall be calculated based on living units equivalent as determined by the size of the water meter(s) for the development or, alternatively, as approved by city council, based on the recommendation of the city manager as a result of an engineering report prepared by a qualified professional engineer licensed to perform such professional engineering services in the State of Texas, which demonstrates that the number of LUEs of service for the new development will be different than those indicated by the size of the water meter. 
(c)  Adjustment in number of LUEs. If the engineer determines that the water pressure in the city's transmission main is significantly higher or lower than standard pressure such that the size of the water meter is not indicative of actual service demand, the council may adjust the number of LUEs based on a smaller or larger sized meter which more accurately reflects the flow rate and the system pressure conditions. 
(d)  Fire demand meters. If a fire demand meter (tap) is purchased for a property, the meter size utilized to calculate the number of LUEs shall be the dimension of the portion of the fire demand meter which reflects the meter size which would provide only domestic service to the property. Such reduced meter size shall then be utilized to calculate the number of LUEs. The meter types used to calculate the number of LUEs shall be either simple or compound meters. To avoid the use of fire flow volumes for domestic usage, the owner of any property for which a fire demand meter is purchased shall be required to execute a restrictive covenant on a form approved by the city attorney, which covenant shall acknowledge the right of the city to assess such fees to subsequent owners of the property. Such covenant shall be executed prior to the purchase of the fire demand meter and shall be filed in the deed records of the county. 
(e)  Establishment, review and presentation of service units upon water tap purchases for lots. Upon water tap purchase for lots for which no water meter has been purchased, service units shall be established by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Texas, shall be reviewed by the engineer and shall be presented to council which shall designate the appropriate number of service units. 
(f)  Revision of service unit designation. The city council may revise the service unit's designation according to the procedure set forth in chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code, as amended, or any successor statute. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.09), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 27-130. - Capital recovery fees per service unit. 
(a)  The maximum capital recovery fee per service unit for the service area shall be computed by taking the growth-related capital construction cost of service in the service area identified in the capital improvements plan, reducing it by any allowable credits and dividing that amount by the total number of projected service units anticipated within the service area which are necessitated by and attributable to new development based on the approved land use assumptions for the service area. Maximum capital recovery fees per service unit for each service area shall be set forth in Exhibit B to this article. 
(b)  Exhibit B may be amended by the city council according to the procedure set forth in chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code, as amended, or any successor statute. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.10), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Editor's note- Exhibit B, referred to in § 27-130 above, has not been included herein, but can be found on file for inspection in the city secretary's office. 
Sec. 27-131. - Assessment of capital recovery fees. 
(a)  Assessment included in approval of subdivision of land or new development. The approval of any subdivision of land or of any new development shall include as a condition the assessment of the capital recovery fee applicable to such development. 
(b)  Manner of assessment. Assessment of the capital recovery fee for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For a development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations following the effective date of this article, assessment shall be before or at the time of recordation of a subdivision plat or other plat and shall be the value of the capital recovery fee per service unit then in effect, as provided in Exhibit B as set forth in section 27-130(a). The city may provide the subdivider with a copy of Exhibit B prior to final plat approval, but such shall not constitute assessment within the meaning of this article. 
(2)  For a development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this article and for which no replatting is necessary prior to tap purchase, assessment shall be upon tap purchase and shall be the value of the capital recovery fee per service unit set forth in Exhibit B. 
(3)  Because fire protection is of critical concern to the community as a whole, water meter size related solely to fire protection is not subject to collection of a capital recovery fee. However, if the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for domestic purposes, as evidenced by the registration of consumption recorded on the city's meter-reading and billing systems, the current owner of the property shall be assessed the current capital recovery fee for the fire protection capacity which has been converted to domestic capacity by its routine usage as domestic capacity. 
(c)  Increase in assessments limited. Following assessment of the capital recovery fee pursuant to subsection (b), no additional capital recovery fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases, as set forth under section 27-129. 
(d)  New assessment required following lapse of plat approval. Following the lapse or expiration of approval for a plat, a new assessment must be performed at the time a new application for such development is filed. 
(e)  Determination of fee assessments. The amount of fee assessments in nominal dollars shall be determined by application of the fee values set forth in Exhibit B, which are expressed in real dollars. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.11), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Editor's note- Exhibit B, referred to in § 27-131 above, has not been included herein, but can be found on file for inspection in the city secretary's office. 
Sec. 27-132. - Calculation of capital recovery fees. 
(a)  Following the request for new development as provided in section 27-130 of this article, the city shall compute capital recovery fees due for new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The number of LUEs shall be determined by the size of the water meter(s) or by evaluation of the engineer and determination of council upon review of reports provided by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Texas, as determined according to section 27-129 of this article; 
(2)  LUEs shall be summed for all meters purchased for the development; 
(3)  The total LUEs shall be multiplied by the appropriate per-unit fee value determined as set forth in section 27-130; and 
(4)  Fee credits and offsets shall be subtracted as determined by the process proscribed in section 27-134 of this article. 
(b)  The maximum capital recovery fee due for a new development shall not exceed the amount provided for in section 27-130. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.12), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 27-133. - Collection of capital recovery fees. 
(a)  No water tap shall be issued until all capital recovery fees have been paid to the city or until a "notice of capital recover fee due" is recorded as provided in this section, except as provided otherwise by contract: 
(1)  For a development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article was derived, the full amount of the water capital recovery fee shall be collected at the time the city issues a building permit if the land is inside the city limits or at the time of an application for a water tap purchase if the land is outside the city limits. In some instances, the capacity needed to serve a development will change between the time of plat submittal and the time of tap purchase. If so, any increase in the fee amount shall be paid at the time of an application for a tap purchase. 
(2)  For a development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this article or for which no replatting is necessary prior to provision of a water tap, capital recovery fees shall be collected at the time the city issues a building permit if the land is inside the city limits or at the time of an application for a water tap purchase if the land is outside the city limits. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.13), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 97-30, § 1, 9-30-1997; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 27-134. - Suspension of fee collection. 
(a)  For any new development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this article in accordance with Texas Local Government Code, chapter 212, or pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations, or for which an application for final plat approval has been made prior to the effective date of this article, the city may assess but shall not collect any capital recovery fee as herein defined on any service unit for which a valid building permit is issued within one (1) year subsequent to the effective date of this article. 
(b)  If the building permit, which is obtained within the period provided for in subsection (a), subsequently expires and no new application is made and approved within such period, the new development shall be subject to the payment of a capital recovery fee as provided in section 27-133. 
(c)  It is hereby declared that it is the intention and purpose of this article not to repeal any other ordinance or provision of this Code now in effect and applicable to water system fees now being charged by the city and this article is intended and made cumulative with all other such applicable ordinances and provisions; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict in language between any section of this article and any other ordinance, section or provision of this Code applicable to water system fees now being charged by the city, the language of this article shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.14), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 27-135. - Offsets and credits against capital recovery fees. 
(a)  Offset of value of system-related facilities against value of capital recovery fee. The city shall offset the present value of any system-related facilities, pursuant to rules established in this section, which have been dedicated to and have been received by the city, including the value of rights-of-way or capital improvements constructed pursuant to an agreement with the city, against the value of the capital recovery fee due for that category of capital improvement. 
(b)  Credit of fees paid prior to effective date of article against capital recovery value. The city shall credit capital recovery, pro rata, acreage or lot fees which have been paid pursuant to any other section of the Code of Ordinances of the city prior to the effective date of this article against the value of a capital recovery due for that category of capital improvement, subject to guidelines established by the city. 
(c)  Limitations. All offsets and credits against capital recovery fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this article and additional standards promulgated by the city which may be adopted as administrative guidelines. 
(1)  No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  The unit costs used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the capital improvements plan for the category of facility within the service area for which the capital recovery fee is imposed. 
(3)  If an offset or credit applicable to a plat has not been exhausted within ten (10) years from the date of the acquisition of the first tap purchase made after the effective date of this article or within such period as may be otherwise designated by contract, such offset or credit shall lapse. 
(4)  In no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer for an offset or credit when no capital recovery fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to this article or for any value exceeding the total capital recovery fees due for the development for that category of capital improvement, unless otherwise agreed to by the city. 
(d)  Application. An applicant for new development must apply for an offset or credit against capital recovery fees due for the development either at or before the time of plat recordation, unless the city agrees to a different time. The applicant shall file a petition for offsets or credits with the city on a form provided for such purpose. The contents of the petition shall be established by administrative guidelines. The city must provide the applicant, in writing, with a decision on the offset or credit request, including the reasons for the decision. The decision shall specify the maximum value of the offset or credit which may be applied against a capital recovery fee, which value and the date of the determination shall be associated with the plat for the new development. 
(e)  Application of offset or credit against capital recovery fee. The available offset or credit associated with the plat shall be applied against a capital recovery fee in the following manner: 
(1)  Such offset or credit shall be prorated equally among all living units equivalent, as calculated in section 27-132, and remain applicable to such LUEs, to be applied at time of plat recordation or application for a water tap purchase, as appropriate, against capital recovery fees due. 
(2)  If the total number of LUEs used by the city in the original offset or credit calculation described in subsection (1) above is eventually exceeded by the number of total LUEs realized by the actual development, the city may, at its sole discretion, collect the full capital recovery fee exclusive of any associated offset or credits for the excess LUEs. 
(3)  At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative credit or offset agreements upon petition by the owner in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the city.

(Ord. No. 90-10, § 1(1.18), 8-28-1990; Ord. No. 2018-13, § 2(Exh. 3), 4-17-2018) 
Sec. 27-139. - Refunds. 
(a)  Refund of unexpended fees. Any capital recovery fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to this article which has not been expended within ten (10) years from the date of payment shall be refunded, upon application, to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid, or if the capital recovery fee was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in section 302.002 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended, or any successor statute. 
(b)  Method of determining refund. If a refund is due pursuant to subsection (a), the city shall prorate the same by dividing the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner or governmental entity shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(c)  Recalculation of maximum impact fee per service unit and resultant refund. Upon completion of all the capital improvements or facilities expansions identified in the capital improvements plan upon which the fee was based, the city shall recalculate the maximum impact fee per service unit using the actual costs for the improvements or expansions. If the maximum impact fee per service unit based on actual cost is less than the impact fee per service unit paid, the city shall refund the difference, if such difference exceeds the impact fee paid by more than ten (10) percent. The refund to the record owner or governmental entity shall be calculated by multiplying such difference by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(d)  Conditions upon which property owners can request refunds. Upon the request of an owner of the property on which a capital recovery fee has been paid, the city shall refund such fees if: 
(1)  Existing service is available and service is denied; 
(2)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and the city has failed to commence construction of facilities to provide service within two (2) years of fee payment; or 
(3)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and has not subsequently been made available within a reasonable period of time considering the type of capital improvement or facility expansion to be constructed, but in any event later than five (5) years from the date of fee payment. 
(e)  Proportional refund when previously purchased meter replaced with smaller meter. The city shall refund an appropriate proportion of capital recovery fee payments in the event that a previously purchased water meter is replaced with a smaller meter, based on the LUE differential of the two (2) meter sizes and the per-LUE fee at the time of the original fee payment, less an administrative charge of fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(f)  Petition for refund. Petition for refunds shall be submitted to the engineer on a form provided by the city for such purpose. Within one (1) month of the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the engineer must provide the petitioner, in writing, with a decision on the refund request, including the reasons for the decision. If a refund is due to the petitioner, the engineer shall notify the finance director and request that a refund payment be made to the petitioner. The petitioner may appeal the determination to the impact fee advisory committee and council, as set forth in section 27-138.

ii.  Factors considered in granting special use permits for towers. In addition to any standards for consideration of special use permit applications pursuant to this section, the city council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although the city council may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one (1) or more of these criteria if the planning director or city council concludes that the goals of this chapter are better served thereby: 
 Height of the proposed tower; 
 Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
 Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
 Surrounding topography; 
 Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
 Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
 Proposed ingress and egress; and 
 Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as discussed in this ordinance. 
iii.  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the planning director or city council, that there is no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, that can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna or tower. An applicant shall submit information requested by the planning director or city council related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
 No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic areas which meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
 Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
 Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
 The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
 The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
 The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
 The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
iv.  Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the city council, after considering the recommendation of the planning director, may reduce the standard setback requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby: 
 Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least seventy-five (75) percent of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line. 
 Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
v.  Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the city council, after considering the recommendations of the planning director, may reduce the standard separation requirements if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby.

vii.  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the city council, after considering the recommendation of the planning director, may waive such requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served by such waiver. 
 Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property used for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. 
 In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived. 
 Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, natural growth around the property perimeter, if adequately preserved, may be sufficient buffer.

(Ord. No. 06-13, § 2, 7-11-2006) 
Sec. 15. - Regulations for placement of signs and billboards. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  The purpose of this section is to promote and protect the health, welfare and safety of the public by regulating existing and proposed signs of all types located in the City of Eagle Pass. It is intended to protect property values, create a more attractive economic and business climate, enhance and protect the physical appearance of the community, preserve the scenic and natural beauty and provide a more enjoyable and pleasing community. It is further intended hereby to reduce sign or advertising distractions and obstructions that may contribute to traffic accidents, reduce hazards that may be caused by signs overhanging or projecting over public rights-of-way, provide more visual open space and curb the deterioration of the community's appearance and attractiveness. 
(2)  This section is intended to promote attractive signs, which clearly present the visual message in a manner that is compatible with their surroundings. The appearance, character and quality of a community are affected by the location, size, construction and graphic design of its signs. Therefore, such signs should convey their messages clearly and simply to enhance their surroundings. 
(3)  The regulations herein are designed to prevent the over concentration, improper placement, and excessive height, bulk, number, and area of billboards. It is recognized that, unlike on-premise signs which are actually a part of a business, billboards are a separate and distinct use of the public thoroughfare. Furthermore, for the purposes of this ordinance, billboards are considered by the City of Eagle Pass as an accessory to the principal use when located on the same lot. With a view to this distinction, billboard signs are regulated differently from on-premise signs. It is intended that billboards be located away from view of residential areas, and that such signs be regulated to protect the character of the area wherein billboards are located, and to conserve property values in these areas. 
(4)  Therefore, pursuant to the general police and zoning powers conferred on the City of Eagle Pass, and with due deference to the constitutional rights of individuals and businesses living and operating within the geographical boundaries of the City of Eagle Pass, the City Council of Eagle Pass hereby enacts this section placing new restrictions upon the display of billboards within the city and its areas of jurisdiction. 
(b)  Definitions. 
    Banner. A sign intended to be hung wither with or without a frame, made of paper, plastic, or fabric of any kind, and which may possess colors, characters, letters, illustrations, or ornamentations.

(Ord. No. 06-13, § 2, 7-11-2006) 
Sec. 20. - Board of adjustment. 
(a)  Board of adjustment. A board of adjustment is hereby established.

Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes vacant. The board of adjustment shall also consist of four (4), or less, alternate members, each of whom shall possess equal qualifications and also be duly appointed for two-year term and be removed for cause in the above manner provided by the City Council of the City of Eagle Pass, Texas, and which alternate members shall serve in the absence of one (1) or more regular members when requested to do so by the city manager. 
(c)  Rules of the board of adjustment. The board shall adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. Such chairman, or in his absence, the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such ordinance, or to effect any variation in such ordinance. 
(d)  Appeals. Appeals to the board of adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City of Eagle Pass, Texas, affected by any decision of the building inspector. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board of adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and by paying a filing fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to the Tax Collector of the City of Eagle Pass, Texas, at the time the notice is filed, which shall be credited to the general fund of the City of Eagle Pass, Texas. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appeal from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of record on application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on the cause shown. 
    The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, giving public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or agent or by attorney. 
(e)  Powers of the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment shall have the following powers: 
(1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by any administrative official in the enforcement of this ordinance. 
(2)  When a property owner can show that a strict application of the terms of this ordinance relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures or the use of land will impose upon him practical difficulties or particular hardship, the board may consider and allow variations of the strict application of the terms of this ordinance if the variations are in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance, and the board is satisfied, under the evidence heard by it, that a granting of the variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant but will alleviate some demonstrable hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the comprehensive plan by this ordinance created. 
(3)  The board may authorize a variance where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property of record at the time of the adoption of this ordinance or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional situation or condition of a specific piece of property, the strict application of a provision of this ordinance would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties and particular hardship upon the owner of the property and amount to a practical confiscation of the property as distinguished from a mere inconvenience to the owner, provided the variation can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the general purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan as established by the regulations and provisions contained in this ordinance. 
(4)  Special exceptions. When in its judgment the public convenience and welfare will not be substantially or permanently injured, the board of adjustment may, in a specific case, after public notice and hearing and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, authorize special exceptions to the regulations herein established as follows: 
i.  To permit a transitional use between a business or industrial district and a dwelling district where a lot in a one-family district or a two-family district abuts upon a lot zoned for business or industrial purposes as follows: 
 On a lot in a single-family dwelling district which sides upon a lot zoned for business or industrial purposes, the board may permit a two-family dwelling. 
 Permit the extension of a building or use into a more restricted district, immediately adjacent thereto, but not more than fifty (50) feet beyond the boundary line of the district in which such building or use is authorized. 
 Grant in undeveloped sections of the city temporary and conditional permits for not more than two (2) years. The granting or existence of such temporary or conditional permit shall not be reason or cause for extension of such permit. 
 Permit such modification of yard, open space, lot area or lot width regulations as may be necessary to secure an appropriate improvement of a parcel of land if such parcel is separately owned at the time of the original passage of this ordinance or subsequent annexation of the city and is of such restricted area that it cannot be appropriately improved without such modification. 
 To determine in cases of uncertainty the classification of any use not specifically named in this ordinance. 
 To grant a permit for the extension of a use, height or area regulation into an adjoining district, where the boundary line of the district divided a lot in a single ownership at the time of the adoption of this ordinance. 
 To permit as an accessory use a parking area for automobiles or a driveway or passageway on a lot or lots in an R-3 Duplex District and/or R-3(A) Apartment District where such lots abut or are across a street of not more than fifty (50) feet in width from a B-1 Neighborhood and Highway Business District, B-2 Business District, or B-3 General Business District, subject, however, to the following provisions: 
ii.  The area shall be properly enclosed with hedge screen, fence, wall or other suitable enclosure having a height of not less than three (3) feet nor more than six (6) feet. Such fence or enclosure shall conform to the front yard regulations of the district in which it is located. 
iii.  The area or driveway shall be paved. 
iv.  No parking of vehicles shall be permitted within six (6) feet of any adjoining lot on which is located a residential structure. 
v.  One sign, not exceeding two and one-half (21/2) square feet in area, may be erected identifying the parking lot or driveway. 
vi.  No charges may be made for parking on the lots and no other business use may be made of the property. 
vii.  Any light used to illuminate said parking area shall be so arranged as to direct the light away from any adjoining premises used for residential purposes. 
viii.  Permit the reconstruction of a building occupied by a nonconforming use, or permit the extension of a nonconforming use of a building upon the lot occupied by such use or building at the time of the passage of this ordinance. 
ix.  Any appeal or permit granted by the board of adjustment shall not be valid if construction authorized by said permit is not begun within a period of sixty (60) days. 
(f)  Powers of the board. 
(1)  In exercising the abovementioned powers such board may, in conformity with the provisions of this act, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. 
(2)  In considering all appeals and all proposed variations to this ordinance the board shall, before making any finding, in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variation will not constitute any change in the district map and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or materially increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the public danger of fires and safety, or materially diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the City of Eagle Pass, Texas. 
(3)  Every variation granted or denied by the board shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact, based on sworn testimony and evidence, specifying the reason for granting or denying the variation. 
(4)  Only one (1) request for each variance shall be considered by the board of adjustment. However, the board may, in its sole discretion, rehear or reconsider a matter if (1) it exceeded its jurisdiction; or (2) a substantial change of conditions has occurred or other considerations materially affecting the merits of the request have occurred following its initial decision; or (3) good cause exists. 
The rehearing or reconsideration must be filed with the board by a person aggrieved by the decision or by the board within ten (10) days after the date the decision is filed in the board's office, accompanied by a processing fee of six hundred dollars ($600.00); otherwise, the decision is final and subject to judicial review as provided by section 211.011 of the Texas Local Government Code. A processing fee is not required if the board seeks to rehear or reconsider a decision.
