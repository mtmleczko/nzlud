PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of League City, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the 1997 Code were the 1968 Code, as supplemented through February 22, 1996. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1968 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of this 2001 republication were the 1997 Code, unsupplemented, and subsequent ordinances through June 13, 2000. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Section 33. - Saving clause, etc. 
    All powers granted heretofore to cities are hereby preserved.

In case of any insufficiency or omission in this Charter, which insufficiency or omission may be supplied by reference to the general laws, such provisions of the general laws are hereby adopted, and the City shall have and exercise all of the powers that it could have acquired by expressly adopting and incorporating into this Charter all of the provisions of such superior and general laws, it being the intent of this Charter that no lawful power of the City shall fail because of any omission, insufficiency or inconsistency in this Charter appearing.

Section 36. - Submission of Charter to electors. 
    The Charter Commission that prepared the original Charter found and declared that it was impracticable to segregate each subject so that the voters might vote "yes" or "no" on the same, for the reason that the Charter was so constructed that in order to enable it to work and function it was necessary that it should be adopted in its entirety. For those reasons the Charter Commission directed that said Charter be voted upon as a whole, and it was submitted to the qualified voters of the City of League City, at an election held for that purpose on the 27th day of March, A.D. 1962, was approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting at said election, and became the Charter of the City of League City upon the entering upon the records of said City, by the governing body of such City, of an official order declaring the adoption of said Charter. 
    The undersigned were members of the original City of League City Charter Commission who were appointed to frame a Charter for the City of League City, and who did certify that the Charter so prepared constituted a true copy of the proposed Charter framed by them for said City of League City, Texas. They further certified that they completed their work on the 15th day of February, A.D. 1962.

Sec. 1-2. - Definitions and rules of construction. 
    In the construction of this Code, and of all ordinances and resolutions passed by the city council, the following definitions and rules of construction shall be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the city council: 
    Generally. Words shall be construed in their common and usual significance unless the contrary is clearly indicated. 
    Charter, this Charter. The term "Charter" or "this Charter" means the home rule charter of the city, adopted by the voters on March 27, 1962, as amended. 
    City. The term "the city" or "this city" means the City of League City, in the County of Galveston and State of Texas. 
    Code, this Code. The term "Code" or "this Code" means the Code of Ordinances of the City of League City, Texas. 
    Computation of time. Whenever a notice is required to be given or an act to be done a certain length of time before any proceeding shall be had, the day on which such notice is given or such act is done shall be counted in computing the time, but the day on which such proceeding is to be had shall not be counted. If the last day of any period is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the period is extended to include the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends on the last day of that month. 
    Council. The term "council," "this council" or "the council" means the city council of the City of League City, Texas. 
    County. The term "county" or "this county" means the County of Galveston, Texas. 
    Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision of this Code requires or authorizes an officer or employee of the city to do some act or perform some duty, it shall be construed to authorize the officer or employee to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates to perform the act or duty unless the terms of the provision specifically provide otherwise. 
    Easement. The term "easement" means a right, liberty, privilege or advantage without profit which the owner of one parcel of land may have in the lands of another; or a right in the owner of one parcel of land, by reason of such ownership, to use the land of another for a special purpose not inconsistent with a general property right in the owner. 
    Gender. Words of one gender include the other genders.

DIVISION 2. - CODE OF ETHICS 
Part I. - Rules of Ethical Conduct 

Sec. 2-33. - Statement of purpose and principles. 
(a)  General. It is the policy of the mayor and city council of the City of League City to hold its elected officials and the appointed officials and employees to the highest standards of ethical conduct. The city council believes that it has a responsibility to make every reasonable effort to assure the citizens of League City that their elected and appointed officials and city employees will always place the public's interest above their own. To that end, the city council has concluded that current state laws regulating the conduct of local public officials should be supplemented by adopting additional regulations for the city's elected and appointed officials and city employees and that city staff should be directed to provide, at least once a calendar year, educational programs to the city's elected and appointed officials and city employees on their legal and ethical obligations under state and local law, including, particularly, their obligation to avoid conflicts of interest. 
(b)  Ethical values. It is the official policy of the city that: 
(1)  City officials shall be independent, impartial, and responsible to the citizens of the city; 
(2)  City officials shall not have a financial interest, and shall not engage in any business, transaction, or professional activity, or incur any obligation, that conflicts with the proper discharge of their duties for the city in the public interest. 
(3)  The principles of personal conduct and ethical behavior that should guide the behavior of city officials include: 
a.  A commitment to the public welfare; 
b.  Respect for the value and dignity of all individuals; 
c.  Accountability to the citizens of the city; 
d.  Truthfulness; and 
e.  Fairness. 
(4)  Under such principles of conduct and ethical behavior, city officials should: 
a.  Conduct themselves with integrity and in a manner that merits the trust and support of the public; 
b.  Be responsible stewards of the taxpayers' resources; and 
c.  Take no official actions that would result in personal benefit in conflict with the best interests of the city. 
(5)  To implement the purpose and principles set out in this policy, the city council has determined that it is advisable to enact rules of ethical conduct to govern city officials. It is the purpose and intent of city council to assure a fair opportunity for all of the city's citizens to participate in government, to adopt standards of disclosure and transparency in government, and to promote public trust in government. 
(c)  Purpose and effect. The statements of purpose and principles that introduce this policy are for guidance only. They are not intended to create binding obligations, to serve as a basis for disciplinary action, or to create any private cause of action. The rules of ethical conduct that follow are intended not only to serve as a guide for official conduct, but also as a basis for discipline of city officials who do not abide by them.

(3)  In deciding if a complaint is frivolous, the board or ethics panel will be guided by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 13, and interpretations of that rule, and may also consider:

A complaint that is not sworn as required by subsection (b)(7) shall not be forwarded by the city secretary to the ethics compliance officer, but shall be returned to the complainant.

(1)  That, within 14 days of receipt of the complaint, he or she may file a sworn response with the city secretary; 
(2)  That failure to file a response does not preclude the ethics review board from adjudicating the complaint;

(Ord. No. 2009-43, § 2, 12-8-2009) 
Sec. 2-40. - Ethics panel. 
(a)  Assignment to an ethics panel. A complaint received by the ethics review board from the ethics compliance officer shall be promptly assigned to an ethics panel consisting of five or more members of the board in the case of a level 1 or level 2 complaint, or three or more members of the board in the case of a level 3 complaint, who shall have the full power to investigate and dispose of the complaint. A complaint shall be categorized by level prior to its assignment to an ethics panel as one of the following: level 1 - complaints likely bearing the potential of criminal sanction, level 2 - complaints not likely to bear potential criminal sanction and level 3 - complaints subject to determination as a frivolous complaint. Each ethics panel shall be constituted according to procedures established by the board. Any member of an assigned ethics panel who recuses himself or herself shall be replaced by another member of the board according to established procedures if that is necessary to ensure that the panel has at least five members or three members, depending on the level of the complaint. The identity of the members of the ethics panel shall be revealed to the person charged in the complaint who, for good cause, may request the recusal of any member of the panel. 
(b)  Notice of charges. The ethics panel shall consider whether the facts of the case establish a violation of any provision in the ethics laws, regardless of which provisions, if any, were identified in the complaint as having been allegedly violated. However, before the ethics panel may find a violation of a particular rule, the respondent must be on notice that compliance with that rule is in issue and must have an opportunity to respond. Notice is conclusively established: if the complaint alleged that the rule was violated; if compliance with the rule is raised by the a member of the board or the ethics compliance officer as a disputed issue at a hearing before the ethics panel; or if the board or the ethics compliance officer provides the respondent with written notice of the alleged violation and a 14-day period within which to respond in writing to the charge. 
(c)  Scheduling of a hearing. Regardless of whether the complainant or the respondent requests a hearing, the ethics panel has discretion to decide whether to hold a hearing. 
(d)  Ex parte communications. It is a violation of this code: 
(1)  For the complainant, the respondent, or any person acting on their behalf to engage or attempt to engage, directly or indirectly, in ex parte communication about the subject matter of a complaint with a member of the ethics panel, any other member of the ethics review board, or any known witness to the complaint; or 
(2)  For a member of an ethics panel or any other member of the ethics review board to: 
a.  Knowingly entertain an ex parte communication prohibited by subsection (1) of this rule; or 
b.  Communicate directly or indirectly with any person, other than a member of the ethics review board, its staff, or the ethics compliance officer, about any issue of fact or law relating to the complaint. 
(e)  Duty to cooperate. All city officials and employees shall cooperate with the ethics review board and shall supply requested testimony or evidence to assist it in carrying out its charge. Failure to abide by the obligations imposed by this subsection is a violation of this code of ethics. 
(f)  Extension of deadlines. A complainant or respondent who fails to meet a deadline to submit a filing with the ethics review board may file a request to accept late filing. The complainant or respondent must include within the request a statement of good cause for the board to grant the request. The assigned panel may grant a request to accept a late filing for good cause. 
(g)  Timeliness of notices or submissions. When the ethics code requires a notice or other document to be submitted or otherwise given to a person or to the ethics review board, the requirement is met in a timely fashion if the document is sent to the person or the board by first-class mail or certified mail addressed with postage or handling charges prepaid and it bears a post office cancellation mark indicating a date within the time required to provide notice or to submit a document, unless another method of submission is expressly required. 
(h)  In the event a complaint has been categorized as a level 1 complaint, the ethics panel may seek the assistance of the League City Police Department for investigative purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2009-43, § 2, 12-8-2009; Ord. No. 2011-59, § 2, 11-8-2011; Ord. No. 2013-41, § 2, 9-24-2013) 
Sec. 2-41. - Hearings. 
    At any hearing held by an ethics panel during the investigation or disposition of a complaint, the following rules apply: 
(1)  General rules. At least three members of the ethics panel must be present for the hearing. Any member of the ethics panel who is not present ceases to be a member of the ethics panel and may not participate in the disposition of the case. All witnesses must be sworn and all questioning of witnesses shall be conducted by the members of the ethics panel or the ethics compliance officer. The ethics panel may establish time limits and other rules relating to the participation of any person in the hearing. No person may be held to have violated the ethics laws unless a majority of the ethics panel so finds by a preponderance of the evidence. The panel may also elect to bring a complaint to the board in its entirety to hear the matter as a panel of the whole board. 
(2)  Evidence. The ethics panel shall rely on evidence of which a reasonably prudent person commonly relies in the conduct of the person's affairs. The ethics panel shall further abide by the following: 
a.  The panel shall hear evidence relevant to the allegations; and 
b.  The panel shall not consider hearsay unless it finds the nature of the information is reliable and useful. 
(3)  The person charged. The person charged in the complaint has the right to attend the hearing, the right to make a statement, the right to present witnesses, and the right to be accompanied by legal counsel or another advisor. Only legal counsel to the person charged in the complaint may advise that person during the course of the hearing, but may not speak on his or her behalf, except with the permission of the ethics panel. The time permitted for presentation will be at the discretion of the board. 
(4)  The complainant. The complainant has the right to attend the hearing, the right to make a statement, and the right to be accompanied by legal counsel or another advisor. Only legal counsel to the complainant may advise the complainant during the course of the hearing, but may not speak on behalf of the complainant, except with the permission of the ethics panel. Witnesses may not be presented by the complainant, except with the permission of the ethics panel. 
(Ord. No. 2009-43, § 2, 12-8-2009) 
Sec. 2-42. - Disposition. 
(a)  Written opinion. The ethics panel shall issue a decision within 90 days after the filing of a complaint. The ethics panel shall state in a written opinion its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The written opinion shall either: 
(1)  Dismiss the complaint; or 
(2)  Upon finding that there has been a violation of the ethics laws: 
A.  Impose sanctions in accordance with these regulations; or 
B.  Recommend criminal prosecution and/or civil remedies, in accordance with this section; or 
C.  state why no remedial action is imposed or recommended. 
    If the ethics panel determines that a violation has occurred, the opinion shall identify in writing the particular rule or rules violated. If the complaint is dismissed, the grounds for the dismissal shall be set forth in the opinion. The failure of the ethics panel to comply within the above time limits may result in the charge being dismissed for want of prosecution. Prior to such dismissal, the complainant will be given notice and an opportunity to request continuance of the action. 
(b)  Notification. Copies of the opinion shall be forwarded to the complainant, the person charged in the complaint, the ethics compliance officer, and any member of the ethics review board who did not participate in the disposition of the case. A copy of the opinion shall also be forwarded to the city secretary, who shall make it available as authorized by law. 
(c)  Recommendations. A recommendation for criminal prosecution shall be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agency. A recommendation of civil remedies shall be forwarded through the ethics compliance officer to the city council for action. 
(d)  Similar charges barred. If the complaint is dismissed because the evidence failed to establish a violation of the ethics laws, the ethics review board shall not entertain any other similar complaint based on substantially the same evidence. 
(e)  Factors relevant to sanctions. 
(1)  General violations (non-reporting violations). In deciding whether to recommend or impose, in the case of a violation of the ethics law, criminal prosecution and/or civil remedies, the ethics panel shall take into account relevant considerations, including, but not limited to, the following: 
A.  The culpability of the person charged in the complaint; 
B.  The harm to public or private interests resulting from the violation; 
C.  The necessity of preserving public confidence in the conduct of local government; 
D.  Whether there is evidence of a pattern of disregard for ethical obligations; and 
E.  Whether remedial action has been taken that will mitigate the adverse effect of the violation. 
    To impose or recommend sanctions for a first violation of the ethics code, other than a letter of notification, a letter of admonition, letter of reprimand or a referral to training, the board must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the person acted knowingly. 
(2)  Reporting requirement violations. To impose sanctions, other than a letter of notification, a letter of admonition, letter of reprimand or a referral to training, for untimely or incomplete submission of reports required by the ethics code, the board must determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the person knowingly failed: 
A.  To file the report on time; or 
B.  To include in the report information that is required to be included. 
    Failure to submit a required report or an amended report after receipt of notice of noncompliance by the city secretary's office, the city attorney's office or the ethics review board may be considered evidence of a knowing failure to comply with reporting requirements. 
    Upon finding a second or subsequent untimely or incomplete submission of reports within a two-year period of time, the board may issue a letter of reprimand regardless of whether the second or subsequent violation was made knowingly by the filer. 
(f)  Civil sanctions for ethics code violations. The following civil remedies may be recommended or imposed by an ethics panel which finds that the ethics code has been violated: 
(1)  Disciplinary action. Employees who violate this code of ethics may be disciplined in accordance with city personnel rules and procedures. Other city officials who engage in conduct that violates this code may be notified, warned, reprimanded, suspended, or removed from office or employment by the appointing authority, or by a person or body authorized by law to impose such remedies. Disciplinary action under this section may be imposed in addition to any other penalty or remedy contained in this code of ethics or any other law. The ethics review board may refer a violation to the city manager or his or her designate for disciplinary action in accordance with any applicable personnel rules; 
(2)  Suit for damages or injunctive relief. This code of ethics has been enacted not only to further the purposes stated herein, but to protect the city and any other person from any losses or increased costs incurred by the city or other person as a result of the violation of these provisions. It is the intent of the city that this ethics code can and should be recognized by a court as a proper basis for a civil cause of action for damages or injunctive relief based upon a violation of its provisions, and that such forms of redress should be available in addition to any other penalty or remedy contained in this code of ethics or any other law. The ethics review board may refer a violation of the ethics code to the city attorney's office for consideration of a suit by the city for damages or injunctive relief. 
(3)  Disqualification from contracting or lobbying. 
A.  If the ethics review board finds that any person (including business entities and nonprofit entities) has intentionally or knowingly violated any provision of the ethics code, the ethics review board may recommend to the city council that the person be prohibited from entering into any contract with the city or prohibited from lobbying on behalf of clients before the city for a period not to exceed three years. 
B.  It is a violation of this code of ethics: 
(i)  For a person debarred from entering into a contract with the city to enter, or attempt to enter, into a contract with the city during the period of disqualification from contracting; or 
(ii)  For a city official or employee to knowingly assist a violation of subsection (B)(i) of this rule. 
C.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any person from receiving a service or benefit, or from using a facility, which is generally available to the public, according to the same terms. 
D.  A business entity or nonprofit entity may be disqualified from contracting based on the conduct of an employee or agent, if the conduct occurred within the scope of the employment or agency. 
(4)  Recommendation to void or ratify contract. If the ethics review board finds that there has been a violation of any provision that is related to the awarding of a contract, the ethics panel must vote on whether to recommend to the city council that the contract be ratified or voided. Such action shall not affect the imposition of any penalty or remedy contained in this code of ethics or any other law. 
(5)  Civil fine. The ethics review board may impose upon any person, whether or not an official or employee of the city, who violates any provision of this code of ethics a fine not exceeding $500.00. Each day after any filing deadline imposed by this article for which any required statement has not been filed, or for which a statement on file is incorrect, misleading, or incomplete, constitutes a separate offense. 
(6)  Letter of notification. The ethics review board may issue to any person, whether or not an official or employee of the city, a letter of notification when the board finds that a violation of the code of ethics was clearly unintentional or inadvertent. The letter must advise the person to whom it is directed of any steps to be taken to avoid future violations. 
(7)  Letter of admonition. The ethics review board may issue to any person, whether or not an official or employee of the city, a letter of admonition when the board finds that the violation of the code of ethics was minor and/or may have been unintentional or inadvertent. 
(8)  Letter of reprimand. The ethics review board may issue to any person, whether or not an official or employee of the city, a letter of reprimand when the board finds that the person has intentionally or knowingly violated the code of ethics. 
(9)  Referral to ethics training. Upon finding of violation of the ethics code, the ethics review board may require a city official or employee to attend ethics code training. 
(g)  Criminal prosecution. An ethics panel may recommend to the appropriate law enforcement agency criminal prosecution under the Texas Penal Code or under Chapter 171 of the Texas Local Government Law. Any person who files a false sworn statement under any provision of this article is subject to criminal prosecution for perjury under the laws of the State of Texas. 
(h)  Reconsideration. Within five business days of receiving the final opinion of the ethics review board, the complainant or respondent may request the ethics review board to reconsider its decision. The request must be filed with the office of the city secretary. Within 15 days after filing with the city secretary, the originally assigned panel shall review the request for reconsideration. If the panel concludes reconsideration is warranted, it shall bring the request within another 15 days to the full board for decision on whether to grant reconsideration. If the full board grants reconsideration, the board may then order further proceedings in accordance with the provisions of this code. 
(i)  Council action. City council shall dispose of a recommendation from the ethics review board within 90 days of receiving such recommendation. The recommendation(s) of the ethics review board may be accepted, rejected, modified, or recommitted to said board for further action or clarification. Failure to take action within specified time limits may result in the charge being dismissed for want of prosecution. Prior to such dismissal, the complainant will be given notice and an opportunity to request continuance of the action. 
(j)  Appeals. A decision of the ethics review board is final unless the person aggrieved by the decision appeals to the state district court in Galveston County no later than 30 days after the date the board renders the decision. An appeal of a board decision is initiated by filing a verified petition setting forth the specific points of error alleged. The district court shall review an appeal under this section under the substantial evidence rule and shall base its decision on the court's review of the record of the hearing before the board. 
    If the decision of the ethics review board is not supported by substantial evidence, the district court may reverse or affirm the board's decision in whole or in part, or may modify the board's decision if substantial rights of the aggrieved person have been prejudiced. Costs of an appeal may not be assessed against the board, individual board members, or the City of League City.

PART III. - CAMPAIGN FINANCE 

Sec. 2-50. - Statement of policy. 
(a)  General. It is essential in a democratic system that the public has confidence in the integrity, independence, and impartiality of those who are elected to act on their behalf in government. There is a public perception that a relationship exists between substantial contributions and access to elected officials. To diminish the perceived or actual connection between contributions and influence, the city adopts these municipal campaign finance provisions to promote public confidence and, it is hoped, a greater degree of citizen participation in the electoral process. These campaign finance provisions do not affect any elected official's obligation to comply with all elements of the Texas Election Code and/or any other applicable state law. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Contribution: A "contribution" means a direct or indirect transfer of money, goods, services, or any other thing of value and includes an agreement made or other obligation incurred, whether legally enforceable or not, to make a transfer. The term includes a loan or extension of credit, other than those expressly excluded by the Texas Election Code, and a guarantee of a loan or extension of credit, including a loan described by the Texas Election Code. 
The term "contribution" does not include a loan made in the ordinary due course of business by a corporation that is legally engaged in the business of lending money and that has conducted the business continuously for more than one year before the loan is made, or an expenditure required to be reported under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 305.006. 
(2)  A loan is deemed to be made in the ordinary due course of business if it: 
a.  Bears the usual and customary interest rate of the lending institution for the category of loan involved; 
b.  Is made on a basis that assures repayment; 
c.  Is evidenced by a written instrument; and 
d.  Is subject to a due date or amortization schedule. 
(3)  Terms not defined in this chapter but defined in the Texas Election Code shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Texas Election Code. 
(Ord. No. 2010-09, § 2, 3-23-2010)

(1)  An employee of the city who is a member of the system may terminate employment and remain eligible to retire and receive a service retirement annuity at any time after that member attains an applicable age and service requirement, if that member has at least ten years of credited service performed for one or more municipalities that have authorized eligibility under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.202(c), or are subject to V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.102(e).

(3)  Any employee of the city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a service retirement annuity if the member has at least 25 years of credited service in the system performed for one or more municipalities that have participation dates after September 1, 1987, or have adopted a like provision under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.202(f). 
(4)  If a vested member, as that term is defined in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.204(b), shall die before becoming eligible for service retirement and leaves surviving a lawful spouse whom the member has designated as beneficiary entitled to payment of the member's accumulated contributions in event of the member's death before retirement, the surviving spouse may, by written notice filed with the system, elect to leave the accumulated deposits on deposit with the system subject to the terms and conditions of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.204(b). If the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse in such amount as would have been payable had the member lived and retired at that date under a joint and survivor annuity (option 1) payable during the lifetime of the member and continuing thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse. 
(5)  At any time before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity, a surviving spouse to whom subsection (4) of this section applies may, upon written application filed with the system, receive payment of the accumulated contributions standing to the account of the member in lieu of any benefits otherwise payable under this section. If such a surviving spouse shall die before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section, the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be paid to the estate of such spouse. 
(6)  Any employee of the city who is a member of the system and who performed service for the city prior to September 1, 1987 (for which service that employee did not receive credit with the system because the employee was not at that time a member of the system due to his age at the date of his employment), is hereby granted service credit with the system for all of such service (performed after the date of his latest employment by the city) that is prior to September 1, 1987, for which the employee has not previously received credit with the system, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Government Code § 852.105. 
(7)  The rights, credits and benefits authorized in this section shall be in addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force at the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Government Code § 851.001 et seq.

a.  The member is physically or mentally disabled for further performance of the duties of the member's employment; 
b.  The disability is likely to be permanent; and 
c.  The member should be retired. 
Any annuity granted under this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.409.

The employees entitled to participate are listed on exhibit A to Ordinance No. 90-04. The city agrees to underwrite and hereby assumes the obligations arising out of the granting of all such credits, and agrees that all such obligations and reserves required to provide such credits shall be charged to the city's account in the municipality accumulation fund.

(b)  This section shall become effective on February 8, 1990, which is a date on or after the date set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

The term "eligible members," as used in this section, shall mean those employees meeting the criteria set forth in V.T.C.A., Government Code §§ 853.502(b) and 853.503, and the amount and use of creditable military service shall be as further set forth in V.T.C.A., Government Code § 853.505. 
(b)  In order to establish credit for military service under this section, a member must deposit with the Texas Municipal Retirement System (in that member's individual account in the employee's saving fund), an amount equal to the number of months for which credit is sought, multiplied by $15.00. The city agrees that its account in the municipality accumulation fund is to be charged at the time of the member's retirement with an amount equal to the accumulated amount paid by the member for military service credit, multiplied by the city's current matching ratio in effect at the date the member applies for such military service credit.

(d)  The hearing shall be conducted by the hearing official under the following guidelines. The hearing official shall liberally construe these guidelines to allow the public input to protect the health and safety of a neighborhood affected by the location of an enterprise and to allow the applicant to address these concerns: 
(1)  The hearing official may exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious. Relevance and materiality shall be evaluated by the relation of the evidence to health and safety concerns directly related to the SOBP at issue, and condition which may be attached to the SOBP to address those concerns. The hearing is not limited to the health and safety concerns specifically identified in the hearing request. 
(2)  Any person may record, videotape or transcribe the hearing provided there is no interference with the proceedings. The hearing official shall have the power to limit any interference with the proceeding. 
(3)  After the conclusion of the public hearing, the hearing official shall produce a written statement containing the official's findings of public health and safety concerns and recommendations for conditions to be attached to the SOBP. The recommendations shall be forwarded to the director, the applicant and the interested party who requested the hearing. When the hearing official determines that public health and safety concerns exist, the director shall attach conditions as part of the SOBP. If no official record of the hearing has been requested, the hearing official's statement shall be the official record of the public hearing. The hearing official may consult with the director for the purpose of developing appropriate conditions to address the health and safety concerns shown at the hearing. 
(4)  If evidence is produced at the hearing that would support denial of the SOBP, the hearing official shall provide that information to the director, who shall investigate whether the evidence warrants denial or revocation of the SOBP under this article.

Cross reference- Utility rates and charges generally, § 114-111 et seq. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 30-31. - Rates for basic service tier. 
(a)  Generally. Basic service tier rates are subject to regulation by the city in order to ensure that they are in compliance with the requirements of 47 U.S.C. 543. Rates that are demonstrated, in accordance with this chapter, not to exceed the initial permitted per-channel charge or the subsequent permitted per-channel charge as described in this section, or the equipment charges as specified in section 30-32, will be accepted as in compliance. The maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier offered by a cable operator shall consist of a permitted per-channel charge multiplied by the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees as well as any applicable state and local taxes. The maximum monthly charges for the basic service tier shall not include any charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and installations are to be calculated separately pursuant to section 30-32. 
(b)  Initial permitted per-channel charge. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, the initial date of regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that (i) the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier, and (ii) this chapter has been adopted by the city. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, the term "rates in effect on the initial date of regulation" or "rates in effect on September 30, 1992," shall mean the rates charged to subscribers for service received on that respective date. 
(3)  The permitted per-channel charge on the initial date of regulation shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
a.  A charge determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding; or 
b.  The charge specified in subsection (b)(3)b.1, 2 or 3 of this section, as applicable. 
1.  If the operator's per-channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is equal to or below the benchmark per-channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the date of initial regulation, then the permitted per-channel charge shall be the per-channel charge in effect on the date of initial regulation, adjusted for equipment. 
2.  If: 
i.  The operator's per-channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per-channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
ii.  The operator's per-channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was above the benchmark per-channel charge; 
then the permitted per-channel charge is nine-tenths of the per-channel charge in effect on September 30, 1992, but no lower than the benchmark per-channel charge, additionally adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tiers. 
3.  If: 
i.  The operator's per-channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per-channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
ii.  The operator's per-channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was below the benchmark per-channel charge; 
then the permitted per-channel charge is the benchmark rate per channel adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tier. 
(c)  Subsequent permitted per-channel charge. After the initial date of regulation, the permitted channel charge for the basic service tier shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
(1)  A per-channel rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing; or 
(2)  The prior permitted per-channel charge previously approved by the city, adjusted for inflation and external costs in accordance with the price cap requirements set forth in subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  Price cap requirements. 
(1)  Inflation adjustments. Permitted per-channel charges for the basic service tier may be adjusted periodically on account of inflation. Adjustments to permitted per-channel charges on account of inflation shall be based on changes in the Gross National Product Price Index (GNP-PI) published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce. 
(2)  External costs. Permitted per-channel charges for the basic service tier may also be adjusted for changes in external costs measured on a per-channel, per-subscriber basis. To the extent external cost increases are greater or less than the GNP-PI for the relevant period, the per-channel charge will be adjusted accordingly. Per-channel charges may not be increased if external costs other than franchise fees increase at a rate less than inflation. Permitted per-channel charges also may, at the city's discretion, be decreased on account of external costs to the extent such costs decrease from previous levels. 
a.  External costs shall consist of costs in the following categories: 
1.  State and local taxes applicable to provision of cable television service; 
2.  Franchise fees; 
3.  Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including costs of providing public, educational and governmental access channels as required by the city; 
4.  Retransmission consent fees; and 
5.  Programming costs. 
b.  The permitted per-channel charge for the basic service tier shall be adjusted on account of programming costs and retransmission consent fees only for programming or broadcast signals offered on that tier. 
c.  The permitted per-channel charge shall not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred prior to October 6, 1994. 
d.  The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs for the basic service tier shall be the initial date of regulation or 180 days from September 1, 1993, if the initial date of regulation occurs on or after 180 days from September 1, 1993. 
e.  Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to permitted per-channel charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as part of the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier. 
f.  Adjustments to permitted per-channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming obtained from affiliated programmers shall be the lesser of actual increases or the previous permitted rate level increased by the amount of inflation. 
g.  Adjustments to permitted per-channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues received by the operator from the programmer. 
(Code 1968, § 30-16; Ord. No. 93-109, § 1, 12-16-1993) 
Sec. 30-32. - Rates for equipment and installation used to receive basic service tier. 
(a)  Applicability. The equipment regulated under this section consists of all equipment in a subscriber's location that is used to receive the basic service tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive other tiers of regulated programming service or unregulated service. Such equipment shall include but is not limited to: 
(1)  Converter boxes; 
(2)  Remote control units; 
(3)  Connections for additional television receivers; and 
(4)  Other cable home wiring. 
Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section. 
(b)  Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation and additional connections separate from rates for the basic service tier. In addition, the rates for such equipment and installations shall be unbundled one from the other. 
(c)  Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an equipment basket, which will include all costs associated with providing customer equipment and installation under this section. Equipment basket costs shall be limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of providing, leasing, installing, repairing and servicing customer equipment, as determined in accordance with the cost accounting and cost allocation requirements of section 30-33. The equipment basket shall not include general administrative overhead, including general marketing expenses. The equipment basket may include a reasonable profit. 
(d)  Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges for equipment and installation using the hourly service charge (HSC) methodology. The HSC shall equal the operator's annual equipment basket costs, excluding the purchase cost of customer equipment, divided by the total person hours involved in installing, repairing and servicing customer equipment during the same period. The purchase costs of customer equipment shall include the cable operator's invoice price plus all other costs incurred with respect to the equipment until the time it is provided to the customer. The HSC is calculated according to the following formula: 
HSC =  EB ;minus; CE 
  H 
Where: 
EB = Annual equipment basket cost; CE = Annual purchase cost of all customer equipment; and H = Person hours involved in installing and repairing equipment per year.  
(e)  Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either: 
(1)  The HSC multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual installation; or 
(2)  The HSC multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type of installation. 
(f)  Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control unit shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of the type of remote leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales tax, financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the customer, added to the product of the HSC times the average number of hours annually repairing or servicing a remote, divided by 12 to determine the monthly lease rate for a remote, according to the following formula: 
Monthly Charge =  UCE + (HSC × HR) 
  12 
Where: 
HR = Average hours repair per year; and UCE = Average annual unit cost of remote.  
Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of remote control unit. 
(g)  Other equipment charges. The monthly charges for rental of converter boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as for remote control units. Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of converter box and each significantly different type of other customer equipment. 
(h)  Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges associated with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at rate levels determined by the actual cost methodology presented in the subsections (e), (f) and (g) of this section. An operator may recover additional programming costs and the costs of signal boosters on the customer's premises, if any, associated with the additional connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional connections. 
(i)  Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover the operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with storing and preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold to the customer, plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service contracts for the maintenance and repair of equipment sold to subscribers. The charge for a service contract shall be the HSC times the estimated average number of hours for maintenance and repair over the life of the equipment. 
(j)  Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation at charges below those determined under subsections (e) through (g) of this section, as long as those offerings are reasonable in scope in relation to the operator's overall offerings in the equipment basket and not unreasonably discriminatory. Operators may not recover the cost of a promotional offering by increasing charges for other equipment basket elements, or by increasing programming service rates above the maximum monthly charge per subscriber prescribed by this chapter. As part of a general cost-of-service showing, an operator may include the cost of promotions in its general system overhead costs. 
(k)  Franchise fees. Equipment charges may include a properly allocated portion of franchise fees paid to the city.

Sec. 30-33. - Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements. 
(a)  Applicability. The requirements of this section are applicable for purposes of rate adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-of-service showings. 
(b)  Accounting methods. Cable operators shall maintain their accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except as otherwise directed by the FCC. 
(c)  Accounts required. Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application of the FCC's cost assignment and allocation procedures to cost categories necessary for rate adjustments due to changes in external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed and supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting records. 
(d)  Accounting level. Except to the extent indicated in this section, cable operators shall aggregate expenses and revenues at either the franchise, system, regional or company level in a manner consistent with practices of the operator as of April 3, 1992. However, in all events, cable operators shall identify at the franchise level their costs of franchise requirements, franchise fees, local taxes and local programming. 
(e)  Cost allocation. 
(1)  For purposes of establishing expenses at the franchise level, cable operators shall allocate expenses and revenues aggregated at higher levels to the franchise level based on the ratio of the total number of subscribers served at the franchise level to the total number of subscribers served at the higher level. 
(2)  Except to the extent indicated in this section, all categories of costs allocated to, or identified at, the franchise level shall be allocated to the basic service tier based on the ratio of channels in the basic tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area, including nonregulated and leased commercial access channels. These costs shall be allocated to each tier of cable programming services based on the ratio of channels in that tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area. 
(3)  Costs of programming and retransmission consent fees, however, shall be allocated only to the tier on which the programming or broadcast signal at issue is offered. 
(4)  Costs of franchise fees shall be allocated among equipment and installations, program service tiers and subscribers in a manner that is most consistent with the methodology of assessment of franchise fees by the city. 
(5)  Costs of public, educational and governmental access channels carried on the basic tier shall be directly assigned to the basic tier where possible. 
(f)  Common costs. Expenses which cannot be assigned to any single expense or service category shall be described as common costs. Common costs shall be allocated to expense categories as follows: 
(1)  Wherever possible, common costs are to be allocated to service cost categories based on direct analysis of the origin of the costs themselves. 
(2)  When direct analysis is not possible, common costs shall, if possible, be allocated to service cost categories based on an indirect, cost-causative linkage to other costs directly assigned or allocated to the service cost category. 
(3)  When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation can be found, common costs shall be allocated to each service cost category based on the ratio of all costs directly assigned and attributed to a service cost category over total costs directly assignable and attributable. 
(g)  Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude from cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of the basic service tier and equipment any direct or indirect expenses and revenues not related to the provision of such services. Common costs of providing the basic service tier and equipment and unrelated activities shall be allocated between them in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. 
(h)  Part-time channels. In situations where a single channel is divided on a part-time basis and is used to deliver service associated with different tiers or with pay-per-channel or pay-per-view service, a reasonable and documented allocation of that channel between services shall be required along with the associated revenues and costs. 
(Code 1968, § 30-18; Ord. No. 93-109, § 1, 12-16-1993) 
Sec. 30-34. - Costs of franchise requirements. 
(a)  The costs of satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational and governmental channels shall consist of the sum of: 
(1)  All per-channel costs for the number of channels used to meet franchise requirements for public, educational and governmental channels; 
(2)  Any direct costs of meeting such franchise requirements; and 
(3)  A reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(b)  The costs of satisfying any other requirement under the franchise shall consist of the direct and indirect costs, including reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(Code 1968, § 30-19; Ord. No. 93-109, § 1, 12-16-1993) 
Sec. 30-35. - Charges for customer changes. 
(a)  This section shall govern charges for any changes in service tiers or equipment provided to the subscriber that are initiated at the request of a subscriber after initial service installation. 
(b)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods shall be a nominal amount, not exceeding actual costs, as defined in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers or equipment that involve more than coded entry on a computer or other similarly simple method shall be based on actual cost. The actual cost charge shall be either the HSC, as defined in section 30-32, multiplied by the number of person hours needed to implement the change, or the HSC multiplied by the average number of person hours involved in implementing customer changes. 
(d)  A cable operator may establish a higher charge for changes effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods, subject to approval by the city, for a subscriber changing service tiers more than two times in a 12-month period, except for such changes ordered in response to a change in price or channel lineup. If a cable system adopts such an increased charge, the cable system must notify all subscribers in writing that they may be subject to such a charge for changing service tiers more than the specified number of times in any 12-month period. 
(e)  Downgrade charges that are the same as, or lower than, upgrade charges are evidence of the reasonableness of such downgrade charges. 
(f)  For 30 days after notice of retiering or rate increases, a customer may obtain changes in service tiers at no additional charge.

Sec. 30-51. - Notification of proposed rate increase. 
(a)  A cable operator shall provide written notice to a subscriber of any increase in the price to be charged for the basic service tier or associated equipment at least 30 days before any proposed increase is effective. The notice shall include a provision stating that protests to such prices may be filed with the city at 300 West Walker Street, League City, Texas. The notice shall also include a statement that such protests must be filed with the city no later than 30 days after the notice is received by the subscriber. 
(b)  In addition to the notice required in subsection (a) of this section, the cable operator shall give the city a minimum of 30 days' advance written notification of any changes in rates for cable programming service or associated equipment. 
(Code 1968, § 30-26; Ord. No. 93-109, § 1, 12-16-1993) 
Sec. 30-52. - Initiation of review of basic cable service and equipment rates. 
    A cable operator shall file its schedule of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment with the city within 30 days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier, or by November 15, 1993, whichever is later. 
(Code 1968, § 30-27; Ord. No. 93-109, § 1, 12-16-1993) 
Sec. 30-53. - Procedure for review of basic cable service and equipment rates. 
(a)  After a cable operator has submitted to the city for review its existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment costs, or a proposed increase in these rates (including increases in the baseline channel charge that results from reductions in the number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed rates will become effective after 30 days from the date of submission to the city; provided, however, that the city may toll this 30-day deadline for an additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in subsection (d) of this section within 30 days of the rate submission explaining that it needs additional time to review the rates. The city may, at any time, require the cable operator to produce additional information, including proprietary information, that the city deems necessary in order to make a rate determination. If proprietary information is provided, the provisions of section 30-54 will apply to such information. 
(b)  Upon receipt by the city, the cable operators's submittal shall be available for public inspection and copying. Comments on the submittal by interested persons may be submitted in writing or orally at a city council meeting held at any time during the initial 30-day review period. Written comments shall be addressed to the city manager, and must be received prior to the end of the 30-day review period. 
(c)  If a cable operator submits a proposed rate increase for review that appears to exceed the presumptively reasonable level and does not include a cost-of-service showing to justify the rate, the city will permit the cable operator to cure this deficiency and submit a cost-of-service showing. 
(d)  If the city is unable to determine, based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the existing or proposed rates are within the permitted basic service tier charge or actual cost of equipment as defined in sections 30-31 and 30-32, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to sections 30-33 and 30-55, seeking to justify a rate above the basic service tier charge as defined in sections 30-31 and 30-32, the city may toll the 30-day deadline established in subsection (a) of this section to request or consider additional information or to consider the comments from interested parties as follows: 
(1)  For an additional 90 days in cases not involving cost-of-service showings; or 
(2)  For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service showings. 
The order tolling the effective date of the proposed rate shall explain why the city could not make the necessary determination, and it shall also provide the cable operator an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in its original filing. During the additional time periods provided in this subsection, comments from interested persons may be submitted in writing, as provided in subsection (b) of this section, or orally, during at least one city council meeting during the period of abatement. 
(e)  If the city has availed itself of the additional 90 or 150 days permitted in subsection (d) of this section, and has taken no action within these additional time periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at the end of the 90-day or 150-day period, or existing rates will remain in effect at such times, subject to refunds if the city subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates. In order to order refunds, the city must have issued a brief written order to the cable operator by the end of the 90-day or 150-day period permitted in subsection (d) of this section directing the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid. 
(Code 1968, § 30-28; Ord. No. 93-109, § 1, 12-16-1993; Ord. No. 2010-25, § 2, 8-10-2010)

(a)  If the city has required the cable operator to produce proprietary information under the provisions of this chapter, the cable operator may submit therewith a request that such information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any materials to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(b)  Each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from inspection and of the facts upon which those reasons are based. If the request is that the materials be withheld from inspection for a limited period of time, that period shall be specified. 
(c)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a request in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the city will not grant routine public access to the materials. A letter to that effect will be placed in a public file in lieu of the materials withheld from public inspection. 
(e)  However, if a written request for the materials is received by the city pursuant to the Open Records Law (V.T.C.A., Government Code § 552.001 et seq.), the city will notify the person providing the materials of the request for the materials. If the person providing the materials requests the city to do so, the city will request an opinion from the attorney general, pursuant to the Open Records Law (V.T.C.A., Government Code § 552.001 et seq.), regarding the public availability of the materials. If the person providing the materials does not request the city to request an opinion from the attorney general, the city may, at its option, either request such an opinion or provide the materials to the public. 
(f)  If the attorney general issues an opinion or letter ruling requiring the city to make the materials available to the public, the materials will be made available for public inspection. 
(g)  If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the city assumes no obligation to consider the need for nondisclosure. 
(h)  The cable operator does not need to provide proprietary information if such disclosure is prohibited by state or federal law, or this information shall be provided with the city taking the necessary precautions to protect the proprietary nature thereof.

The certification shall be in writing, shall be signed by the general manager of the system, and shall be verified. 
(2)  Such certification shall be subject to verification by the city on its own motion or upon complaint by a subscriber. The city may request additional information from the operator in order to verify the certification. If proprietary information is requested by the city, the provisions of section 30-54 shall control the availability of such information to the public. 
(3)  As used in this section, the term "initial rates" shall mean those rates charged by the small system operator on the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that (i) the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier and (ii) this chapter has been adopted by the city. 
(4)  If the city determines that the small system's certification is in error, it shall so notify the small system operator and shall require the small system to comply with all filing requirements for non-small systems in this chapter. 
(5)  Subsequent rate filings by a small system operator shall comply in all respects with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Option 2. 
(1)  A small system may certify that the small system's rates for basic service and associated equipment, and subsequent rate increases, comply with section 30-31. A certification by a small system under this subsection for its initial rates shall be filed with the city within 30 days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier. Certifications for subsequent rate increases shall be filed with the city at the same time that notice is given to the small system's subscribers of the proposed rate increase, in conformance with section 30-51. All certifications shall be in writing, shall be signed by the general manager of the system, and shall be verified. 
(2)  Such certification shall be subject to verification by the city on its own motion or upon complaint by a subscriber.

Sec. 30-59. - Refunds. 
(a)  The city may order a cable operator to refund to subscribers that portion of previously paid rates determined by the city to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the rate charged as reasonable. Before ordering a cable operator to refund previously paid rates to subscribers, the city shall give the operator notice and an opportunity to comment. The operator's opportunity to comment upon the proposed refunds may be at any meeting of the city council during the city's period of review of the operator's rates. If the city has extended its review period under section 30-53, and has issued an accounting order under section 30-53(e), then the operator, prior to refunds being ordered, may request an opportunity to appear before the city council to comment upon the proposed refunds. 
(b)  An operator's liability for refunds is limited to a one-year period, except that an operator that fails to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city shall be liable for refunds commencing from the effective date of such order until such time as it complies with such order. 
(c)  The refund period shall run as follows: 
(1)  From the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction back in time to September 1, 1993, or one year, whichever is shorter. 
(2)  From the date the city issues an accounting order pursuant to section 30-53(e), and ending on the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction ordered by the city, or one year, whichever is shorter. 
(d)  The cable operator, in its discretion, may implement a refund in the following manner: 
(1)  By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid the overcharges, either through direct payment or as a specifically identified credit to those subscribers' bills; or 
(2)  By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment to cover the cumulative overcharge. This shall be reflected as a specifically identified, one-time credit on prospective bills to the class of subscribers that currently subscribe to the cable system. 
(e)  Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments.

Sec. 31-3. - Application, review and approval procedures. 
(a)  A completed application for the erection or modification in height of each communication tower or structure, and for the installation of associated communication equipment of whatever nature, shall be approved by city staff and by the city planning commission. 
(1)  Pre-application meeting. Prior to leasing or purchasing facilities, the applicant is encouraged to meet with the planning staff of the city to determine any restrictions to locations and facilities, and to discuss the permitting requirements. 
(2)  Reserved. 
(b)  The application reflects a two-fold and sequenced process, consisting of an administrative review by all city departments and an evaluation by the building official prior to issuing of a special use permit or a major special use permit, if the proposed tower, or an existing tower to be modified, is planned to be higher than 200 feet. 
(1)  Administrative review application. The proponent of any new communication tower/structure or associated equipment shall complete the city's "communication towers application form" and provide the following documentation to the planning department: 
a.  Inventory of existing sites owned. Each applicant for one or more towers shall provide to the planning department an inventory list of its existing towers inside the corporate limits of the city and also within one statute mile beyond the city limits. This inventory shall include information about location, height, design and usage of each tower. The applicant shall also provide a drawing, titled master plan, showing the location of each transmission facility and the design area of transmission coverage. Proprietary information shall not be included either on the list or on the master plan. This information will become part of a permanent record for the city, and may be shared with other persons, organizations or governmental authorities seeking to locate antennae within the city. The service provider shall also provide the city with any updates to the master plan within 90 days of their creation. 
b.  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the planning department that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. The applicant shall submit any of the following items as evidence: 
1.  No existing towers or structure are located within the geographic area, meeting the applicant's engineering requirements. 
2.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the engineering requirements. 
3.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment and cannot be reinforced to provide sufficient structural strength. 
4.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the existing antenna would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
5.  The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs less than new tower development are presumed to be reasonable. 
6.  Property owners or owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to accommodate the applicant's needs. 
7.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
c.  Site plan. Submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting construction documents, calculations, signed and sealed by appropriate professional engineers, and other documentation showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning radio frequency coverage, topography, drainage, tower height requirements, setbacks, easements, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent owners and adjacent land uses, and other information to assess compliance with this chapter. The site plan shall include all areas that are adjacent to and within 500 feet of the site lot lines.

    The operator or production representative shall provide one of the following security instruments outlined in subsections (1) and (2): 
(1)  Bond. A bond, in the amount established by fee resolution, shall be executed by a reliable bonding or insurance institution authorized to do business in Texas and acceptable to the city. The bond shall become effective on or before the date the permit is issued and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term or until the well is abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs last. The operator or production representative shall be listed as principal and the instrument shall run to the city, as obligee, and shall be conditioned that the operator or production representative will comply and perform in accordance with the terms and regulations of this article and other applicable city ordinances. The original bond shall be submitted to the city. 
(2)  Letter of credit. A letter of credit in the amount as established by the city fee resolution shall be issued by a reliable bank authorized to do business in Texas and shall become effective on or before the date the permit [is issued]. The letter of credit shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit. If the letter of credit is for a time period less than the life of the well as required by this article, the operator must agree to either renew the letter of credit or replace the letter of credit with a bond in the amount required by this article, on or before 45 days prior to the expiration date of the letter of credit. If the operator fails to deliver to the city either the renewal letter of credit or replacement bond in the appropriate amount on or before 45 days prior to the expiration date of the letter of credit, the city may draw the entire face amount of the letter of credit to be held by the city as security for the operator's performance of its obligations under this article. 
(3)  The city shall be authorized to draw upon such letter of credit or bond to recover any fines, penalties, defaults or violations assessed under this chapter. Also, the letter of credit may be used to draw down city road damage expense to the extent road damage cost exceeds the road damage fee paid with the permit application. Evidence of the execution of a letter of credit shall be submitted to the city by submitting an original signed letter of credit from the banking institution, with a copy of the same provided to the city. 
(4)  If at any time after no less than a 15-day written notice to the operator and a public hearing, the city council shall deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, it may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum amount as established by the city fee resolution. 
(5)  Whenever the city finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this chapter, a written notice shall be given to the operator unless immediate compliance is needed due to a serious health or safety condition. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the city to be reasonably necessary for the completion of any work. After receipt of such notice, the [operator] shall, within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay over to the city 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than 30 days unless the failure presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this article. 
(6)  The city shall be authorized to draw against any irrevocable letter of credit or bond to recover such amount due from the operator. Upon receipt of such monies, the city shall proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred other than for the expenditure of said sum in hand. In the event that the well has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the railroad commission, such additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly plug and abandon the well and restore the drill site in conformity with the regulations of this article. 
(7)  In the event the operator does not cause the work to be performed and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable irrevocable letter of credit or bond the city may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action against the operator, or by criminal action against the operator, or by both such methods or any other remedy available by law. 
(8)  When the well or wells covered by said irrevocable letters of credit or bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this article, and in conformity with all regulations of the railroad commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and cancelled.

If the letter of credit is for a time period less than the life of the well as required by this article, the operator or production representative must agree to either renew the letter of credit or replace the letter of credit with a bond in the amount required by this article, on or before 45 days prior to the expiration date of the letter of credit. If the operator or production representative fails to deliver to the city either the renewal letter of credit or replacement bond in the appropriate amount on or before 45 days prior to the expiration date of the letter of credit, the city may draw the entire face amount of the letter of credit to be held by the city as security for the operator's or production representative's performance of its obligations under this article. 
(3)  The city shall be authorized to draw upon such letter of credit or bond to recover any fines, penalties, defaults or violations assessed under this chapter.

(5)  Whenever the city finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this chapter, a written notice shall be given to the operator or production representative unless immediate compliance is needed due to a serious health or safety condition. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the city to be reasonably necessary for the completion of any work. After receipt of such notice, the operator or production representative shall, within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay over to the city 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice.

(7)  In the event the operator or production representative does not cause the work to be performed and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable irrevocable letter of credit or bond the city may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action against the operator or production representative, or by criminal action against the operator or production representative, or by both such methods or any other remedy available by law. 
(8)  When the well or wells covered by said irrevocable letters of credit or bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this article, and in conformity with all regulations of the railroad commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and cancelled.

(1)  Pump station permits-Bond. A bond, in the amount established by fee resolution, shall be executed by a reliable bonding or insurance institution authorized to do business in Texas and acceptable to the city. The bond shall become effective on or before the date the permit is issued and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term or until the pump station is abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs last. The operator shall be listed as principal and the instrument shall run to the city, as obligee, and shall be conditioned that the operator will comply and perform in accordance with the terms and regulations of this article and other applicable city ordinances. The original bond shall be submitted to the city. 
(2)  Pipeline and pipeline modification permits-Installation bond. An installation bond in the amount as established by the city fee resolution shall be rendered prior to the granting of the permit. The operator shall provide to the city a good and sufficient license and permit bond to provide surety that the applicant shall faithfully perform the work and all the conditions set out in his permit and that all work within the city shall be in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of this article. Any violation of this division or the conditions set out in the permit shall cause the bond to be forfeited in favor of the city. 
(3)  Letter of credit. A letter of credit in the amount as established by the city fee resolution shall be issued by a reliable bank authorized to do business in Texas and shall become effective on or before the date the permit [is issued]. The letter of credit shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit. If the letter of credit is for a time period less than the life of the pipeline or pump station as required by this article, the operator must agree to either renew the letter of credit or replace the letter of credit with a bond in the amount required by this article, on or before 45 days prior to the expiration date of the letter of credit. If the operator fails to deliver to the city either the renewal letter of credit or replacement bond in the appropriate amount on or before 45 days prior to the expiration date of the letter of credit, the city may draw the entire face amount of the letter of credit to be held by the city as security for the operator's performance of its obligations under this article. 
(4)  The city shall be authorized to draw upon such letter of credit or bond to recover any fines, penalties, defaults or violations assessed under this chapter. Also, the letter of credit may be used to draw down city road damage expense to the extent road damage cost exceeds the road damage fee paid with the permit application. Evidence of the execution of a letter of credit shall be submitted to the city by submitting an original signed letter of credit from the banking institution, with a copy of the same provided to the city. 
(5)  If at any time after no less than a 15-day written notice to the operator and a public hearing, the city council shall deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, it may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum amount as established by the city fee resolution. 
(6)  Whenever the city finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this chapter, a written notice shall be given to the operator unless immediate compliance is needed due to a serious health or safety condition. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the city to be reasonably necessary for the completion of any work. After receipt of such notice, the operator shall, within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay over to the city 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than 30 days unless the failure presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this article. 
(7)  The city shall be authorized to draw against any irrevocable letter of credit or bond to recover such amount due from the operator. Upon receipt of such monies, the city shall proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred other than for the expenditure of said sum in hand. In the event that the pipeline has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the railroad commission, such additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly abandon the pipeline and restore the site in conformity with the regulations of this article. 
(8)  In the event the operator does not cause the work to be performed and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable irrevocable letter of credit or bond the city may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action against the operator, or by criminal action against the operator, or by both such methods or any other remedy available by law. 
(9)  When the pipelines and pump stations covered by said irrevocable letters of credit or bond have been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this article, and in conformity with all regulations of the railroad commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and cancelled.

    The legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, V.T.C.A., Water Code § 16.315, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of the City of League City does ordain this article.

Sec. 50-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses may be created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2018-14, § 1, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 50-33. - Purpose of article. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health. 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects. 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions. 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains. 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas.

    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structures.

    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the criteria outlined in subsections (a)-(j) of this section are met, and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 50-84. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-61 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures permitted on or after October 1, 2018, shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated 24 inches above the larger of the base flood elevation (BFE), the crown of the nearest street or the highest grade adjacent to the building and be a minimum of three inches above the nearest 500-year flood.

Sec. 50-85. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-61 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. No fill shall be allowed except by special permit through city council. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(3)  When fill or any other development is placed in the floodway that could have the effect of increasing the base flood of the flood waters in the floodway, then the cumulative increase shall not exceed a height of zero inches. 
(Ord. No. 2018-14, § 1, 6-26-2018) 
Sec. 50-86. - Coastal high-hazard areas. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 50-61 are areas designated as coastal high-hazard areas (zones V1-30, VE, and V). These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from tidal surges and hurricane wave wash; therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions outlined in this article, the following provisions also apply: 
(1)  The following information shall be obtained: the elevation in relation to mean sea level of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor, excluding pilings and columns, of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all such information. 
(2)  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
(3)  All new construction and substantial improvements permitted on or after October 1, 2018, shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that: 
a.  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor, excluding the pilings or columns, is elevated to a minimum of 24 inches above the larger of the base flood elevation (BFE), the crown of the nearest street or the highest grade adjacent to the building and be a minimum of three inches above the nearest effective 500-year flood elevation included in the flood insurance study. 
b.  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (500-year mean recurrence interval). A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections (3)(a) and (b) of this section. 
(4)  All substantial improvements to structures completed prior to October 1, 2018, shall be elevated on piling and columns so that: 
a.  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor, excluding the pilings or columns, is elevated to a minimum of 18 inches above the larger of the base flood elevation (BFE), the crown of the nearest street or the highest grade adjacent to the building. 
b.  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval). A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections (3)(a) and (b) of this section. 
(5)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood latticework or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or the supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and not more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
a.  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
b.  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading valued to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval). 
(6)  If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation. 
(7)  The use of soil fill for structural support of buildings is prohibited. 
(8)  Manmade alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.

Sec. 54-139. - Nuisance declared. 
    Graffiti which is located in any place where it is visible from a public right of way is detrimental to the safety and general welfare of the general public, tending to reduce the value of private property, to invite vandalism and other criminal offenses, creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, and is detrimental to the economic welfare of the city by producing urban blight which is adverse to the maintenance and continuing development of the city, and is therefore declared to be a public nuisance. To effectively deal with the nuisance of graffiti, the city hereby adopts the following procedures for abatement and removal of graffiti and said procedures may be utilized by the police department officers and code enforcement officers when dealing with the nuisance created by graffiti. 
    Whenever the existence of graffiti on any lot or parcel of real estate situated within the city shall come to the knowledge of the department, the department shall cause a written notice identifying the graffiti and directing its removal to be sent to the owner of the property.

After the expiration of ten (10) days from the date on this notice, unless an appeal is timely made, the city may proceed with the abatement of the graffiti at your expense without further notice. 
If the appeal is timely filed with the City of League City Code Enforcement Department, then the appeal (hearing) shall be conducted by a hearing official designated by the City for the purpose of determining whether the conditions constitute a public nuisance. Unless notice is waived by the owner, the owner shall be provided written notice of the time and place of appeal (hearing) at least ten (10) days prior thereto. At the appeal (hearing), the owner and representatives of the City may present any evidence relevant to the proceedings. If the hearing official finds that conditions constituting a nuisance exist, the hearing official shall issue an order so stating. 
If the owner fails to abate the graffiti after it is determined at an appeal (hearing) that the condition of the property constitutes a nuisance, then the City shall be authorized to carry out the abatement of the graffiti and to assess its expenses and place a lien on the property.

In abating such graffiti, the city or its contractor is expressly authorized to enter and abate graffiti upon utility cabinets and exterior walls and fences abutting public streets, property, or rights-of-way. 
(b)  If the owner demonstrates that none of the family members residing in a homestead that is the subject of a graffiti notice is able to apply the paint because of age, physical disabilities, dependent care obligations or other limitations beyond their reasonable control, then the city representative shall cause the graffiti to be abated without cost to the owner, and no lien shall be placed on the homestead property. The operation of this subsection is limited to any single-family residential property that is occupied as a homestead. 
(c)  If an owner demonstrates that (1) the property for which the owner has been given notice of graffiti hereunder has been the subject of at least two prior graffiti incidents (evidenced by either notices provided pursuant to this article or bona fide police reports) during the preceding 180 days, and (2) the owner complied with the requirements of this article by abating the prior graffiti within ten days of the date of the applicable notice or police report, then the city officer shall cause the graffiti to be abated without cost to the owner, and no lien shall be placed on the property.

The notice shall request payment to the city within 30 days of receipt by the owner. The cost for removal shall constitute a lien on the property payable within such 30-day period and thereafter bearing the then judicial approved rate of interest per annum until the debt is paid.

For any such expenditures, and interest, suit may be instituted by the city attorney and recovery and foreclosure of the lien may be had in the name of the city and the statement of expenses made, or a certified copy thereof, shall be prima facie proof of the amount expended in such work or improvements. Upon payment of the full charges assessed against the property, pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section, the city manager or his duly designated agent shall be authorized to execute, for and on behalf of the city, a written release of the lien heretofore mentioned, such written release to be on a form prepared and approved in each case by the city attorney.

ARTICLE III. - REGULATION OF SEX OFFENDER RESIDENCY 

Sec. 70-50. - Finding and intent. 
    The city council of the City of League City, Texas finds that repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the health, safety and welfare of children. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offense and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
    It is the intent of this ordinance to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residences. 
(Ord. No. 2006-81, § 1, 8-22-2006)

    Temporary residence means a place where the person abodes, lodges or resides for a period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the person's permanent address or a place where the person routinely abodes, resides or lodges for a period of four or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not the person's permanent residence. 
(Ord. No. 2006-81, § 1, 8-22-2006) 
Sec. 70-52. - Sex offender residency prohibition, penalty, and exceptions. 
(a)  If a person is required to register on the Texas Department of Public Safety's Sex Offender Database because of a violation involving a victim who was less than 17 years of age, it is unlawful for that person to establish a permanent residence or temporary residence within 2,000 feet of any premises where children commonly gather, including but not limited to, a school, day care center, playground, public or private youth center, public swimming pool or video arcade facility, as those terms are defined in Sections 341.064 and 481.134 of the Health and Safety Code of the State of Texas and Section 42.002 of the Human Resources Code of the State of Texas. 
(b)  for the purpose of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent or temporary residence to the nearest property line of the premises where children commonly gather, as described herein, or in the case of multiple residences on one property, measuring from the nearest wall of the building or structure occupied or the parking/driveway, which ever is closer to the nearest property line of the premises where children commonly gather as described herein. A map generally depicting the prohibited areas or zones is attached to this article for representation purposes. The city shall review this map at least annually for changes and make such map available for public inspection at the League City Police Department. 
(c)  In cases of a dispute over measured distances, it shall be incumbent upon the person(s) challenging the measurement to prove otherwise. 
(d)  Any person, firm or corporation that violates this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine in accordance with the general penalty section 1-5 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(e)  Nothing in this article shall be interpreted to modify or reduce the state's child safety ban. A person, as described in subsection (a), residing within 2,000 feet of those places where children commonly gather, as specified herein, does not commit a violation of this article if any of the following apply: 
(1)  The person established the permanent or temporary residence and has complied with all the sex offender registration laws of the State of Texas prior to the date of the adoption of this article; 
(2)  The person was a minor when he/she committed the offense and was not convicted as an adult; 
(3)  The person is a minor; 
(4)  The premises where children commonly gather, as specified herein, within 2,000 feet of the person's permanent or temporary residence was opened after the person established the permanent or temporary residence and complied with all sex offender registration laws of the State of Texas; or 
(5)  The person proves that the information on the database is incorrect and that, if corrected, this chapter would not apply to the person. 
(Ord. No. 2006-81, § 1, 8-22-2006) 
Sec. 70-53. - Injunctive relief. 
    Any violation of this article may be enjoined by a suit filed in the name of the City of League City, Texas, in a court of competent jurisdiction, and this remedy shall be in addition to any penal provision in this ordinance or in the Code of Ordinances of the City of League City.

    Applicant is a person who submits the completed city application with the required documentation for a permit to canvas, peddle, or solicit in the city for commercial purposes. An applicant may be an individual person, organization, or corporation. 
    Application is the city's form for information, documentation, and any required attachments as described in the city's form, for submission by applicant to the chief of police or his designee for consideration of approval for a permit. The chief of police or his designee shall prescribe the city's form for the application. The application must be completed with all required information as described herein, including, but not limited to, the name, address, contact telephone number, current photograph, and driver's license number, of applicant, and each individual canvasser, peddler, or solicitor listed in the application. If applicant is an organization or corporation, the required information shall be provided by applicant's designated individual representative, including the designated individual representative's name, address, contact telephone number, current photograph, and driver's license, in addition to all other required information as described herein. Failure by applicant to provide all information as required may result in disapproval of the application. 
    Canvasser is a person who distributes commercial handbills or flyers door to door (without personal contact with an owner, resident, or occupant, of the residence) advertising any commercial goods, events, or services, for which a fee is required to be paid to by the occupant in order to obtain the advertised goods, services, or to attend or participate in the advertised event. 
    Crimes of moral turpitude include, but are not limited to, murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape, statutory rape, domestic violence, prostitution, fraud and crimes where fraud is an element, all theft offenses, blackmail, malicious destruction of property, arson, alien smuggling, harboring a fugitive, bribery or perjury. 
    Identification card i s a document issued upon approval of an application by the chief of police or his designee to each individual canvasser, peddler, or solicitor, as listed in the application, pursuant to these regulations. The identification card shall be worn as described in section 78-67. 
    Individual means only a natural person. 
    Peddler is a person who attempts to make personal contact with an owner, resident, or occupant at his/her residence without prior specific invitation or appointment from the resident, for the primary purpose of attempting to sell any commercial goods or services for profit. 
    Permit is the document issued to an applicant by the chief of police or his designee upon approval of an application for canvassing, peddling, or soliciting under this division. Identification cards, with the name and current photograph of each individual canvasser, peddler, or solicitor shall be issued upon approval of the permit. If the applicant fails to provide the photographs as required, the permit shall be revoked. 
    Solicitor is a person who attempts to make personal contact with an owner, resident, or occupant at his/her residence without prior specific invitation or appointment from the owner, resident, or occupant, for the primary purpose of taking or offering to take orders for future delivery of any commercial goods or services for profit, by going upon private premises from house to house or place to place without prior consent of the owner, resident, or occupant.

Such youthful uniformed solicitors may be accompanied by a parent or responsible adult, who also shall not be regulated hereunder as a solicitor or peddler. The regulation of door to door commercial canvassing, peddling, and/or solicitation requires a sensitive balance between the goal of identification of unknown persons at our doorsteps and freedom of speech. Any regulation and any exception must be clear and justifiable. All commercial canvassers, peddlers, and solicitors shall comply with these regulations unless council has found herein or finds hereafter that the type of solicitation they perform is inherently local, protected by law and/or deserving of exemption.

(1)  The representatives of youth sports organizations described hereinabove. 
(2)  The representatives of scouting organizations described hereinabove.

See section 78-59 for those persons deemed by council to have such an express invitation from all residents of the city.

Signage for lane closures shall be required in compliance with the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, as the same may be amended. Lane closure on major thoroughfares will be limited to the hours after 8:30 a.m. and before 4:00 p.m. unless the director grants prior approval. 
(j)  Working hours in rights-of-way. This subsection applies to all work in the rights-of-way other than emergencies. The working hours in the right-of-way shall be limited to between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Work that needs to be performed at any other time must be approved in advance by the director. 
(k)  Line locates. Persons working in the rights-of-way are responsible for obtaining line locates from the Texas One-Call System, the city, and all affected utilities and others with facilities in the right-of-way prior to any excavation. Use of the geographic information system or the plans of record do not satisfy this requirement. The permittee will be responsible for verifying the location, both horizontal and vertical, of all existing facilities. When required by department of planning and development, the permittee shall verify locations of potential conflicts with existing facilities by pot holing, hand digging or other method approved by the department of planning and development prior to any excavation or boring with the exception of work involving lane closures, as discussed in the preceding subsection (j) of this section. Placement of all manholes and/or handholes must be approved in advance by the department of planning and development. Handholes or manholes shall not be located in sidewalks, unless approved by the director. Locate flags shall be removed during the clean up process by the right-of-way user or its contractor at the completion of the work, unless the right-of-way user determines otherwise for safety reasons. The right-of-way user, contractor or subcontractor shall notify the department of planning and development immediately of any damage to other utilities, either city- or privately-owned. 
(l)  Conservation of public rights-of-way. To the extent the city may be authorized by state or federal law to do so, and to the extent reasonable under the circumstances then existing, the city may require a user of the right-of-way to attach portions of their facilities to other facilities within the public rights-of-way owned and maintained by other persons. A user of the rights-of-way shall not be required to attach its facilities to the facilities of such other person(s) if it is shown that such right-of-way user would be subjected thereby to increased risks of interruption to its service, to increased liability for accidents, or to unreasonable delays in construction or availability of service, or if the facilities of such other person are not of the character, design, or construction required by, or are not being maintained in accordance with, current practice, or are not available to the right-of-way user on reasonable terms, including, without limitation, reasonable fees. In requiring such work to be done, the city shall not be liable for any damages so caused nor shall the city be liable for any damages arising out of the performance of such work by the city's licensees or franchisees; provided, however, nothing shall relieve any other person from liability for damages to the facilities of the right-of-way user. 
    Insofar it is practical to do so, right-of-way users shall use existing facilities in the provision of their services; provided, however, nothing contained in this article shall be construed as limiting a right-of-way user from expanding its facilities to accommodate future growth and development. 
(m)  Informational signs. Except as otherwise provided in this article, three by three feet information signs stating the identity and telephone number of the person doing the work, and the permittee's identity and telephone number, shall be placed at the location where construction is to occur prior to the beginning of work in the right-of-way. Such signs shall continue to be posted at the location during the entire time the work is occurring. An information sign will be posted on a public right-of-way 100 feet before the construction location and at each end of the construction location, unless other posting arrangements are approved or required by the director. If a vehicle clearly marked with the company name and telephone number of the person doing the work is parked at the construction site, the informational signs shall not be required. 
(n)  Abandonment and removal of facilities. Facilities must be removed when they are no longer in service and when they either create visual blight or create a nuisance to the public; provided, however, a right-of-way user shall not be required to remove any facilities for which renovation, restoration, or a future use is planned by the right-of-way user. When permanent structures in public rights-of-way are removed or abandoned, the city shall be notified in writing of such removal or abandonment. The director may direct such remedial measures as the director may determine are necessary for public safety and the integrity of public rights-of-way until such time that the facilities are completely and satisfactorily removed from the public rights-of-way. 
(o)  Signage. All signs required under this section and this article must conform to the requirements set forth in the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, as amended. To the extent compliance with such signage requirement conflicts with the signage restrictions contained in the city's scenic byway ordinance, governing the installation and maintenance of signs on certain designated roadways in the city, the director shall have discretion to determine which provision applies on a project-by-project basis. 
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § 2(9), 12-12-2000; Ord. No. 2015-47, § 3, 12-8-2015) 
Sec. 98-160. - Long range planning for capital improvements projects. 
    The right-of-way user shall keep the city informed as to existing and planned construction, maintenance and other activities of the right-of-way user within public rights-of-way. Quarterly planning and coordination meetings will be held for that purpose. Representatives of the right-of-way user and the city shall meet quarterly or as required at the request of the director for the purpose of discussing long-term planning for capital improvement projects contemplated by each with respect to the public rights-of-way. The right-of-way user shall include within its capital improvement projects the plans of the city relating to same. Except for emergencies, the right-of-way user shall coordinate all installations and construction within the public rights-of-way with the city's capital improvement programs. Within 60 days after the city council adopts the city budget for the following fiscal year, the city shall forward in writing a list of the improvement projects to the right-of-way user (including street widening projects, street overlay projects, bridge improvement projects, new street construction projects, drainage and utility improvement projects, and park improvement projects) that are included in the adopted budget. Within 60 days of the receipt of the city's list of improvement projects, the right-of-way user shall provide a written report to the city that identifies and generally describes the existing facilities that are within or cross through the project boundaries of each project identified by the city. The city and the right-of-way user shall provide to each other the names of their respective designated officials who will serve as representatives for coordination of the exchange of information and planning of any such project. When requested right-of-way users shall field locate their facilities within five working days of the request for design of the city's facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § 2(10), 12-12-2000) 
Sec. 98-161. - Improperly installed facilities. 
    Any person doing work in the right-of-way shall properly install, repair, upgrade and maintain the facilities. Facilities shall be considered to be improperly installed, repaired, upgraded or maintained if: 
(1)  The installation, repairs, upgrade or maintenance endangers people; 
(2)  The facilities do not meet the applicable federal and state laws and city codes; 
(3)  New facilities are not capable of being located using standard practices; 
(4)  The facilities are not properly spaced, are not located in the proper place, or are not located at the proper depth at the time of construction in accordance with the permit; or 
(5)  The facilities are placed in an area that interferes with city-owned facilities including, but not limited to, water or sewer lines or streets. Privately-owned facilities shall be considered to interfere with city-owned facilities if the privately-owned facility is within three feet horizontally of the city-owned facility, or the distance required by the permit, whichever is greater. Nothing in this section shall diminish the authority of the director to direct the specific placement of specific line. 
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § 2(11), 12-12-2000) 
Sec. 98-162. - "Plans of record" plans. 
(a)  Within 90 days of completion of facilities in the right-of-way, right-of-way users must provide the director with "plans of record" in electronic format compatible with the city's computer system and software. Users who have facilities in the right-of-way existing as of the date of this ordinance and who have not produced such "plans of record" plans shall provide one-quarter of the information concerning its facilities in city rights-of-way within one year after the passage of the ordinance from which this article derives (December 12, 2000), and one-quarter each of the three six-month periods thereafter. The plans shall be provided to the city with as much detail and accuracy as required by the director. All the requirements specified for the plans submitted for the initial permit, as set forth in section 98-158, shall be submitted and updated in the plans of record. The detail and accuracy will concern issues such as location, size of facilities, materials used, and any other health, safety and welfare concerns. The detail will not include matters such as capacity of lines, customers, or competitively sensitive details. 
(b)  This requirement, or portions of this requirement, may be waived at the discretion of the director. 
(Ord. No. 2000-64, § 2(12), 12-12-2000) 
Sec. 98-163. - Bonds, letters of credit, insurance and indemnity. 
(a)  A right-of-way user shall submit a bond, letter of credit or statement of fiscal ability to the city in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Bond. At the time of submission of its initial and each renewal registration application, a user of the right-of-way, who selects this option, shall file with the city a corporate surety bond from a surety company authorized to do business in the state in the amount of $50,000.00 plus an amount equal to the amount of the estimated cost to restore the rights-of-way for work anticipated to be performed in the succeeding five years by the right-of-way user. A right-of-way user with a current franchise, license or other written consent, shall submit its bond within 60 days of enactment of this article and every five years thereafter. The bond shall be valid for the entire registration period. The bond shall provide, but not be limited to, the following condition: There shall be recoverable by the city, jointly and severally from the principal and surety, any and all damages, loss or costs suffered by the city from a right-of-way user's incomplete, unsafe or unfinished work in the rights-of-way. The bond shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the surety nor any intention not to renew be exercised by the surety until sixty (60) days after receipt by the city, by registered mail or written notice, of such intent to cancel or not to renew." The rights reserved by the city with respect to the bond are in addition to all other rights of the city and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such bond shall affect any other rights of the city. 
(2)  Letter of credit. 
a.  At the time of submission of its initial and each renewal registration application under section 98-157, the right-of-way user, who selects this option, shall deposit with the director an irrevocable letter of credit in a form satisfactory to the director and the city attorney. A right-of-way user with a current franchise, license or other written consent, shall submit its letter of credit within 60 days of enactment of this article and every five years thereafter. The amount of the irrevocable letter of credit shall be in the amount of $50,000.00 plus an amount equal to the amount of the estimated cost to restore the rights-of-way for work anticipated to be performed during the registration period. The letter of credit shall be issued by a federally insured commercial lending institution with a credit rating of BAA or BBB+ or higher. The federally insured commercial institution of which the irrevocable letter of credit is to be drawn shall be acceptable to the city. The irrevocable letter of credit is to be drawn shall be acceptable to the city. The irrevocable letter of credit shall be used to: 
1.  Ensure the right-of-way user's compliance with the terms and conditions of this article; and 
2.  Ensure the right-of-way user's payment of any liabilities arising out of the construction, installation, operation or maintenance of the right-of-way user's facilities in the rights-of-way, including the cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the right-of-way user. 
b.  The irrevocable letter of credit shall contain the following endorsement: "At least sixty (60) days prior written notice shall be given to the Director of Planning and Development by the financial institution of the right-of-way user of any intention to cancel, replace, fail to renew, or materially alter this irrevocable letter of credit. Such notice shall be given by certified mail to the City Director of Planning and Development and the City Attorney." 
c.  After providing the right-of-way user 30 days' advance written notice of the amounts due and owing and the right-of-way user's failure to pay such amounts, the city may draw upon the irrevocable letter of credit by presentation of a draft at sight on the lending institution, accompanied by a written certificate signed by the city manager certifying that the right-of-way user has failed to comply with the requirements of this article. 
d.  The right-of-way user shall structure the irrevocable letter of credit in such a manner so that if the city draws upon the irrevocable letter of credit and reduces the amount of available credit to an amount below $50,000.00, the right-of-way user shall replenish the irrevocable letter of credit to a minimum of $50,000.00 within five calendar days after the available credit is reduced to the amount below such amount. The intent of this subsection is to ensure that the credit available to the city shall at no time fall below $50,000.00. 
e.  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the irrevocable letter of credit are in addition to all other right of the city, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or right with respect to the irrevocable letter of credit shall affect any other right the city has or may have. 
(3)  Statement of fiscal responsibility. In lieu of the bond or letter of credit, the right-of-way user may provide to the city written evidence in the form of its most recent audited financial statement showing assets or reserves sufficient to cover the amount of the bond or letter of credit required by this section. If the right-of-way user's assets or reserves are no longer adequate to comply with the amount required by this section, the right-of-way user shall immediately notify the city and shall obtain the bond or letter of credit referenced above. 
(b)  Insurance. A right-of-way user shall procure and maintain insurance in full force and effect at all times while its facilities are located in the rights-of-way. The insurance shall cover all risks associated with the use and occupancy of the rights-of-way. All coverages must be on an "occurrence basis" with the exception of excess liability coverage, which may be on a "claims-made" basis according to the requirements set forth in this section. 
(1)  Risks and limits of liability. The insurance, at a minimum, must include the following coverages and limits of liability: 
Coverage Limits of Liability Worker's Compensation Minimum statutory limits Employer's Liability Bodily Injury by Accident: $1,000,000.00 (each accident) Bodily injury by disease: $1,000,000.00 (policy limit) Bodily injury by disease: $1,000,000.00 (each employee) Commercial General Liability: Including Broad Form Coverage, Contractual Liability, Bodily and Personal Injury, and Completed Operations Combined single limits of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and $1,000,000.00 aggregate Products and Completed Operations $1,000,000.00 aggregate Automobile Liability Insurance for Automobiles Used by Licensee in the Course of Its Performance Under the License, Including Employer's Non-Owned and Hired Auto Coverage $1,000,000.00 combined single limit per occurrence Excess Coverage $1,000,000.00 per occurrence/combined aggregate in excess of limits specified for Employer's Liability, Commercial General Liability and Automobile Liability Note: All aggregate limits are for a 12-month policy period, unless otherwise indicated.  
(2)  Forms of policies. The insurance may be in one or more policies of insurance, the form of which must be approved by the city manager. 
(3)  Issuers of policies. The issuer of any policy must be authorized to transact insurance business in the state. Each issuer must be responsible and reputable and must have financial capability consistent with the risks covered. 
(4)  Insured parties. Each policy must name the right-of-way user and the city (and the officers, employees and agents of the city) as insured parties or as "additional insured's." 
(5)  Deductible. The right-of-way user shall assume and bear any claims or losses to the extent of any deductible amounts and waives any claims it may ever have for the deductible amounts against the city, its officers, agents or employees. 
(6)  Cancellation. Each policy must expressly state that it may not be canceled or non-renewed unless 30 days advance notice by certified or registered mail of cancellation or non-renewal is given in writing to the city. 
(7)  Subrogation. Each policy must contain an endorsement to the effect that the issuer waives any claim or right in the nature of subrogation to recover against the city, its officers, employees or agents. 
(8)  Liability for premium. If any of the policies referred to above does not have a flat premium rate and such premium has not been paid in full, such policy must have a rider or other appropriate certificate or waiver sufficient to establish that the issuer is entitled to look only to the right-of-way user for any further premium payment and has no right to recover any premiums from the city. 
(9)  "Other insurance" clause. The insurance policy (or policies) must provide that the "other insurance" clause does not apply to the city when the city is an additional insured shown on the policy. 
(10)  Delivery of certificates of insurance. Certificates of insurance showing that the insurance required by this section is in effect, together with written proof that the premiums have been paid, shall be deposited by the right-of-way user with the director prior to commencement of any work. With respect to commercial general liability and automobile liability policies, the right-of-way user shall, if the director so requests in writing, provide the following additional evidence of insurance: a copy of the declaration page(s) identifying the policy form, a list of all applicable policy endorsements, and copies of all endorsements applicable to the insurance. Failure by the right-of-way user to furnish a new certificate of insurance before the expiration date of any such policy, or failure to obtain a new policy before the date fixed for the cancellation of an existing policy, so that the insurance referred to shall be continuously in effect, shall constitute a basis for denying a permit under this article. 
(11)  Liability of right-of-way user. The city's approval, disapproval or failure to act regarding any insurance supplied by the right-of-way user shall not relieve such person from full responsibility or liability for damages and accidents arising out of use or occupancy of the right-of-way. Neither shall bankruptcy, insolvency or denial of liability by the insurance company exonerate the right-of-way user from liability. 
(12)  Self-insurance. A right-of-way user may elect to self-insure to provide the insurance coverage required under this section, subject to the restrictions set forth in this subsection, provided that the right-of-way user submits to the city copies of its certificates of self-insurance from the state department of insurance and its most recent audited financial statements showing self-insurance reserves or other assets sufficient to pay judgments equal to the limits set forth above. A right-of-way user shall also provide to the city documentation evidencing its process for reviewing and paying claims. The city shall be protected by a right-of-way user's self-insurance to the same extent as an additional insured on a policy issued by an insurance company. If a right-of-way user's self-insurance program ceases, or a right-of-way user's assets or reserves are no longer sufficient to comply with the above coverage requirements, the right-of-way user shall immediately notify the city of such lapse of coverage, and the right-of-way user shall obtain commercial insurance in accordance with the above requirements within 30 days following such notice to ensure no lapse of coverage for the city. 
(13)  "Tail" purchase for excess coverage policy. If a right-of-way user has or purchases a "claims-made" insurance policy for its excess liability coverage and any such policy(ies) expires, is not renewed or is canceled, the right-of-way user shall purchase a termination "tail" or "inception tail" to be in effect for a period of at least four years from and after the cancellation, expiration or non-renewal date of the particular claims-made policy. The right-of-way user shall purchase insurance tail prior to the non-renewal, cancellation or expiration of the affected claims-made policy and present written evidence of such purchase to the city manager. The insurance company and types and amounts of insurance must meet all requirements of this section. 
(c)  Indemnity. To the extent permitted by law, each right-of-way user shall indemnify and hold the city harmless as follows: 
The right-of-way user shall, as part of its permit, enter into an agreement by which it agrees to promptly defend, indemnify, and hold the city harmless from and against all damages, costs, losses, or expenses (1) for the repair, replacement, or restoration of city's property, equipment, materials, structures, and facilities that are damaged, destroyed, or found to be defective solely as a result of the right-of-way user's acts or omissions; and (2) from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action, and judgments for (a) damage to or loss of the property of any person (including, but not limited to, the right-of-way user, its agents, officers, employees, and subcontractors, and the city, its agents, officers, and employees, and third parties; and/or (b) death, bodily injury, illness, disease, loss of services, or loss of income or wages to any person (including but not limited to, the agents, officers, and employees of the right-of-way user, right-of-way user's contractors, and the city's officers, agents, and employees, and third parties), arising out of, incident to, concerning, or resulting from the negligent or willful acts or omissions of the right-of-way user, its agents, employees, and/or subcontractors, in the performance of activities pursuant to this article. 
This indemnity provision is intended to include liability arising from the city's alleged negligence, but only to the extent such liability arises out of a claim or claims that the city was negligent in granting a permit under this article, in consenting to allow use or occupancy of the right-of-way, in regulating the conduct of the right-of-way user, or in failing to prevent the right-of-way user from acting in a negligent or wrongful manner. 
    For purposes of this indemnification provision, acts or omissions of the officers, agents, employees, and contractors of the right-of-way user shall be considered the acts and omissions of the right-of-way user. 
    The indemnity provision set forth above is solely for the benefit of the city and the right-of-way user and is not intended to create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person.

If such approval is filed, the city secretary shall set a time and place for the hearing and shall notify the right-of-way user in writing. Such hearing shall be held within 30 days of the date the appeal is filed with the city secretary and at least five business days after notification to the right-of-way user of the date and time of the hearing unless such notification time period is waived by the right-of-way user. At the hearing the right-of-way user shall be entitled to all rights of due process consistent with federal and state laws.

All other provisions of this Code shall remain in full force and effect. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this article and any other ordinance in this Code of Ordinances, the more restrictive provision shall control unless otherwise specified or provided.

Service levels shall be met from the first points of egress from and ingress to the proposed development to and including the intersection with the first public roadway from the development with a classification one level higher than the development's highest internal street classification in all directions from the development; or the City of League City, Galveston County, Harris County or the State of Texas has programmed for construction in a capital improvements program or similar plan, funded in the then current fiscal year, additional roads or road improvements necessary in combination with existing roads and intersections to comply with the standards specified in subsection (b)(1) above; or 
c.  The applicant agrees to undertake the construction of the roads or road improvements necessary to comply with the standards specified in subsection (2)a. above. 
(3)  Developments where the city council wants to encourage redevelopment would be allowed to proceed in certain areas experiencing unacceptable levels of service, provided that transportation improvements are made which would result in an improvement in traffic operations beyond what would have been expected if the development had not occurred. In addition, mitigation measures may be required by the city engineer to comply with the standards specified in subsection (2)a. above. 
(4)  Traffic impact analysis (TIA). A TIA shall be performed by the property owner (or its agent) according to the format established in Appendix A of this article, as follows: 
a.  When an activity on or change to property occurs that generates more than 1,000 PHT, the property owner (or its agent) shall perform and submit to the city a TIA under the level 3 format specified in Appendix A. This TIA must be signed and sealed by a professional engineer, registered to practice in Texas. 
b.  When an activity on or change to property occurs that generates 501 PHT to 1,000 PHT, the property owner (or its agent) shall perform and submit to the city a TIA under the level 2 format specified in Appendix A. This TIA must be signed and sealed by a professional engineer, registered to practice in Texas. 
c.  When an activity on or change to property occurs that generates 101 PHT to 500 PHT, the property owner (or its agent) shall perform and submit to the city a TIA under the level 1 format specified in Appendix A. This TIA must be signed and sealed by a professional engineer, registered to practice in Texas. 
d.  When an activity on or change to property occurs that generates 100 PHT or less, the property owner (or its agent) shall provide a completed city PHT generation form certifying that the activities to be conducted on the property will generate 100 PHT or less. No TIA will be required for activities generating 100 PHT. 
e.  When an activity on, or change to, property occurs that varies from the activity on which a previous TIA was submitted and accepted, and the new activity or change, places the project into a level different from that of the previous TIA or generates an increase of at least 100 PHT (or ten percent for a level 3 TIA) relative to the previous TIA, the property owner (or its agent) shall perform and submit to the city an amended TIA under the formats specified in Appendix A (as appropriate). For the purposes of this section, the amendment will be satisfactory to determine if the increase in PHT impacts capacity and requires additional mitigation as defined herein. 
(5)  Minimum right-of-way widths. 
a.  Major arterials. A 100-foot right-of-way is required. An additional ten-foot municipal utility easement may be required on both sides.

When used, the following note shall be shown on the face of the plat: "A one-foot strip is reserved as a buffer separation along and between the side or end of all streets in this subdivision plat where such streets abut adjacent tracts. At such time as the adjacent property is at such locations that about land in adjoining tracts that have been dedicated to the public for street right-of-way purposes and is shown for such purposes on a recorded plat, such one-foot strip shall thereupon become vested in the public for street right-of-way purposes." 
b.  Half streets and partial streets are prohibited. 
(13)  Intersections. Street intersections shall preferably be at right angles, and never less than 75 degrees. Block comers with acute angles require a 30-foot radius for street right-of-way. All intersections of a "T" nature that intersect major or minor arterial and collector streets must first be approved by the city engineer. Modern roundabouts may be considered. 
(14)  Line of sight. See section 125-40 of the zoning ordinance. 
(15)  Driveways. Access to freeways, major or minor arterials or collector streets is prohibited from the side or rear of a lot. Residential driveways must provide for two-car side-by-side parking, or the street to which the driveway has access must be a minimum of 34 feet in width.

(17)  Street markers and signage. Appropriate street signs shall be installed as required in this chapter. 
(18)  Escrow account for cost of bridges. Where subdivisions border on drainage ditches at which streets will dead end pending development of property on the opposite side, the applicants shall place in escrow an amount equal to 50 percent of the estimated cost of design plus construction of a bridge designed sufficiently to carry the traffic load thereof. Such estimated cost shall be determined by the city engineer. The escrow account is to be in abeyance, in an interest-bearing account, for a period of ten years. The account shall be established by the applicant, with the city being a trustee to the account. 
(19)  Escrow account for traffic control devices. When a traffic impact analysis or a Texas Department of Transportation approval indicates signalization of an intersection will be required under a future warrant, the Developer shall place in escrow with the City of League City an amount equal to their pro-rata cost of the future installation. Cost shall be established as present value plus three percent per annum inflation. 
(20)  Sidewalks. 
a.  For residential development, four-foot wide, concrete sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all collectors, arterials and residential streets within and along the boundaries of the subdivision in accordance with city specifications. The builder is responsible for constructing the portion of the sidewalk that abuts all lot frontages. All other required sidewalks are the responsibility of the developer. 
b.  For commercial development, four-foot wide, concrete sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with city specifications prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

d.  Waiver of sidewalk improvement requirements . In locations where there have been no sidewalks prior to the time of construction of the commercial development, sidewalk requirement may be waived by the planning and zoning commission. A waiver shall be based upon determination by the planning and zoning commission that the construction of a new sidewalk along all (or a part of) the streets abutting the development is impractical, imprudent or otherwise unreasonable, considering factors such as the amount of pedestrian traffic that would otherwise use the sidewalk, technical or practical impediments to pedestrian use of the sidewalk in that location, or such other factors as the planning and zoning commission may deem appropriate on a case by case basis. 
(21)  Private streets. 
a.  For the purposes of this section, the term "private street or non-dedicated right-of-way" is defined to mean a non-dedicated street on private property, including but not limited to the following: 
(i)  Any area, parcel or strip of land, whether or not the same is depicted or shown as such on any plan, map or drawing, which is not a duly dedicated and established public street of and in the city and which provides access from any public street in the city to one or more buildings designed or appropriate collectively for occupancy by four or more families, or for occupancy or use by two or more businesses, industrial or commercial establishments or for occupancy and use by one or more industrial, commercial or business establishments and or more families, and to which buildings there is no other access from such public street than over the area, strip or parcel of land in questions; or

Under this definition, the public shall be considered as being permitted to so use such area, strip or parcel of land if in fact it does so and its use is not obstructed by gates, chains or watchmen. The mere fact that there may be posted signs prohibiting such use by the public shall not suffice to keep the area from being considered a private street under the terms of this article if in fact the owner thereof does not take and continue to take steps sufficient to prevent such use. 
b.  The term "private street" shall not include the following: 
(i)  Any driveway designed principally to provide access to any building or between any principal building and the outbuildings appurtenant thereto, or to provide access to delivery platforms or the entrances of a building appropriate for the delivery thereto of goods or merchandise; 
(ii)  An area appurtenant to a store or a group of stores, a theater, a church or any similar establishment, designed primarily to be used as a parking space by customers or patrons of the establishment or group of establishments in question; or 
(iii)  An entrance way or roadway designed to provide entrance to or communication or passage to or between the several units of a single industrial establishment or of a group of such establishments which are under common control or management; provided such industrial entranceway or roadway shall be considered a private street under the terms hereof if it has entrances upon two or more public streets, unless there are, at each of such entrances, gates, chains or watchmen by which all persons are prevented from using the same except those employed by or having business to conduct or such industrial plants or establishments in question. 
c.  Private streets will be permitted to be constructed only with the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and approval of the city council. 
d.  All franchisees under franchises granted by the city may use private streets, as defined herein, and no franchise or other authorization shall be granted in a private street by any person or entity without a franchise having been duly authorized or the prior written consent having been given by the city. 
e.  Agreement between city and developer. An agreement between the city and any person or entity seeking to construct a private street in the city (the "developer") will be required before a private street will be approved for construction. The agreement will be subject to city council review every five years and will specify, at a minimum: 
(i)  That the developer shall convey to the city the necessary easement and right-of-way over a private streets so that the city may provide services to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city; 
(ii)  That the developer or assigns shall maintain the surface and condition of such private street or non-dedicated right-of-way so as to permit the city to use its easement and right-of-way over such private street in a reasonably safe and convenient manner. Should the developer or assigns fail to provide the required standard of maintenance after first being given written notice of the nature of such failure and a reasonable time thereafter (not to exceed 90 days) to cure such failure, the city shall have the right to remedy such failure and receive reimbursement from the developer for the actual cost thereof; 
(iii)  Time table as to when developer has to deed over to the homeowners or property owners association; 
(iv)  That the developer shall not hold the city or any of its personnel to be guilty of trespass in regard to the use of its easement and right-of-way as defined herein; 
(v)  That the developer shall not later, block or vacate such private street so as to interfere with or prevent the city from providing the municipal services referred to herein. However, the developer may close such private street for short periods of time on an occasional basis so as to prevent the public dedication of such street and may erect signs identifying the private nature of such street; 
(vi)  That the developer shall be responsible for the installation of all service pipes and hydrants on such private street as are required by the operating procedures of the city; and 
(vii)  Installation, operation and maintenance of street lighting are the responsibility of the developer and their assigns. 
f.  Private streets will be constructed according to city and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specifications. 
(22)  Gates on private streets. 
a.  Entrances to communities with private streets shall be controlled by electrically operated gates which are physically manner or electronically operated on a 24-hour-per-day basis. Where electrically operated, unmanned access gates are in place on private streets, one entrance gate at each entrance must be equipped with a 911 override control switch. For entrances with two gated lanes of entry, only one of these gated entries requires an electronically operated gate. The second one may be manually operated.

(2)  The developer shall install an on-site drainage system capable of conveying through and from the property the design flow of storm water runoff originating in the development during a special flood hazard area as determined in accordance with criteria specified in the City of League City Master Drainage Plan, in addition to flows from undeveloped land upstream in the natural watershed of the proposed development, flows from existing upstream developments, and designs flows from developments for which plats and plans have been approved, without resulting in erosion, sedimentation or flooding of the receiving channel and downstream properties. 
(3)  The off-site downstream drainage system shall be capable of conveying to an acceptable outfall the design flow of storm water runoff originating in the development, as determined in accordance with criteria specified in the master drainage plan in addition to flows from undeveloped land up-stream in the natural watershed of the proposed development, flows from existing upstream developments, and design flows from developments for which plats have been recorded, without resulting in erosion, sedimentation, or flooding of the receiving channel and down-stream properties. 
(4)  For any proposed development that drains to or across highly erodible soils, the downstream extent of this review shall be to the point at which a channel is found that is adequate to receive the design flow or the level of the tidal floodplain. 
(5)  For development that does not drain to or across highly erodible soils, the downstream extent of this review shall be: 
(i)  To the point at which a channel is found that is adequate to receive the design flow, or 
(ii)  To the point at which the total drainage area is at least 100 times greater than the area of the proposed development, or 
(iii)  To the limit of the nearest FEMA mapped special flood hazard area. 
(6)  Off-site downstream drainage system improvements. The storm drainage system shall be in compliance with subsection (h)(2) and the city must have awarded a contract for the construction or improvement of off-site downstream drainage systems necessary, in combination with existing systems, to comply with the standard specified in subsection (h)(3) and if the construction or improvement of the off-site downstream drainage system is expected to be completed before the issuance of the first building permit for the development or the developer agrees to under-take the construction or improvement of the off-site downstream drainage systems. 
(7)  Calculating runoff. The storm water runoff flows from land for which a plat has not been recorded shall be calculated as if the land was developed according to its existing zoning classification and as if storm water management techniques, as may be required by the master drainage plan, have been utilized. Storm water runoff flows from other lands shall be calculated on the basis of whether or not storm water management techniques have been utilized. 
(8)  Channel. A channel shall be defined as a natural or manmade channel or pipe that is capable of conveying the runoff from a ten-year storm without overtopping its banks or eroding after development of the site in question, or without causing the flooding of structures from a 100-year storm event. 
(i)  Water quality. Protect and preserve the aquatic ecosystems and water resources throughout the City of League City as it complies with federal, state and local government. Provide mitigation efforts so that waters in the city will meet all designated usage.

(Ord. No. 2007-08, § 2, 2-13-2007) 
Sec. 102-14. - Variances. 
(a)  The planning and zoning commission may grant a variance to any of the provisions of article I of chapter 102, except for requirements in the city's adopted engineering and construction standards, pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section and upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence by the applicant that: 
(1)  There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property in question; 
(2)  That enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of a substantial property right; and 
(3)  That such variance, if granted, would not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or property rights in the vicinity. 
Each and every application for variance shall be decided solely and entirely on its own merits; neither the lack of enforcement of any ordinance nor the disposition of any prior or pending application for variance may be considered or allowed to affect any decision on the application in question. Pecuniary interests standing alone shall not be justification for the granting of a variance. 
(b)  The application fee and procedures for a public hearing and provision of notice shall be the same as established by the city for a rezoning request, except that the applicant shall include a copy of this section with any notice that the applicant is required to mail. 
(c)  The planning and zoning commission may, by affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of its members present and voting, grant a variance to the regulations of article I of chapter 102 if it finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that all of the following criteria are met: 
(1)  There are unique conditions peculiar to the subject parcel or tract that do not exist on adjacent parcels or tracts; 
(2)  Strict application of chapter 102 deprives the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other land in area or land with similar uses; 
(3)  The variance, if granted, does not frustrate the intent and purpose of chapter 102 and community, neighborhood, and other applicable land use and development plans, and will not adversely affect property or property values in the vicinity of the subject site; 
(4)  Conditions supporting the granting of the variance request are not self-created by disregard or ignorance of federal, state, or local codes and/or ordinances; and 
(5)  The variance is tailored as narrowly as possible while still granting the relief sought. 
(d)  Factors that may not be considered to support the granting of a variance include, but are not limited, to the following: 
(1)  Personal and/or economic hardship; 
(2)  Misrepresentation of property conditions, uses, or regulations by a seller or agent; 
(3)  Errors made by a surveyor, contractor, or builder; and 
(4)  Increasing the profit, income, or competitive advantage of the applicant; and 
(5)  Threats to locate or relocate outside of the city, or cancel or scale back a project, if a variance is denied. 
(e)  The applicant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that the requirement(s) of article I of chapter 102 from which a variance is requested, if uniformly applied, imposes an undue hardship or disproportionate burden on the applicant. The applicant shall submit statements, studies, and any other relevant information as may be required by the city planner to substantiate the claim(s) for which a variance is requested. If any information is so required, the application for variance shall be deemed complete only upon the submittal of all such required information. The planning and zoning commission and/or city council during review and consideration of the request may require additional studies or information from the applicant, which additional information must be submitted before any action may be taken on the variance application. The offer or submittal, at any stage of the variance application process, by the applicant of any information that proves to be false shall cause the variance request to be denied. If a variance request is approved based upon information offered or submitted by the applicant, without regard to the applicant's knowledge of the falsity of said information, and subsequent to the approval of the variance the approving authority finds said information to be false by a preponderance of the evidence, the variance shall be considered null and void as of the date of that finding and the approving authority shall reconsider the variance request in light of the corrected information. 
(f)  The decision of the planning and zoning commission on a variance request may be appealed within 14 days of said decision by filing with the city secretary: 
(1)  The applicant's written appeal; or 
(2)  A written request by two members of the city council to place consideration of the variance upon the agenda of a city council meeting. 
The city council shall decide the appeal at a meeting not later than 45 calendar days after the date on which the appeal is submitted and may, by majority vote of those present and voting, affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the planning and zoning commission. Such decision of the city council shall be final.

b.  Trip generation and design hour volumes (provide table). 
(i)  A trip generation summary table listing each type of land use, the building size assumed, the average trip generation rates used (total daily traffic and a.m./p.m. peaks), and the resultant total trips generated shall be provided. 
(ii)  Generated vehicular trip estimates may be discounted in recognition of other reasonable and applicable modes, e.g., transit, pedestrian, bicycles. Furthermore, trip generation estimates may also be discounted through the recognition of passby trips and internal site trip satisfaction. 
(iii)  Proposed trip generation calculations for single-story commercial properties shall be based on a floor-to-area (building size to parcel size) ratio of 0.25 or more. 
c.  Trip distribution (provide figure by site exit). The estimates of percentage distribution of trips by turning movements from the proposed development. 
d.  Trip assignment (provide figure by site entrance and boundary street). The direction of approach of site-attracted traffic via the area's street system. 
e.  Existing and projected traffic volumes (provide figure for each item). Existing traffic volumes are the numbers of vehicles on the streets of interest during the time periods listed below, immediately prior to the beginning of construction of the land development project. Projected traffic volumes are the numbers of vehicles, excluding the site-generated traffic, on the streets of interest during the time periods listed below, in the build-out year. 
(i)  A.M. peak hour site traffic (including turning movements). 
(ii)  P.M. peak hour site traffic (including turning movements). 
(iii)  A.M. peak hour total traffic including site-generated traffic and projected traffic (including turning movements).

f.  Capacity analysis (provide analysis sheets in appendices). 
(i)  A capacity analysis shall be conducted for all public street intersections and junctions of major driveways with public streets which are significantly impacted (as agreed to by developer's engineer and the city traffic engineer) by the proposed development within the previously defined study boundary. A capacity analysis is required as shown below: 
Boundary Street Non-Boundary Street within Study Area Existing conditions Required Required Phase 1 Required Not required Intermediate construction Phases Required Not required Final phase/build-out year (existing infrastructure) Required Required Final phase/build-out year (proposed infrastructure) Required Required  
(ii)  Capacity analysis will follow the principles established in the latest edition of the transportation research board's Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), unless otherwise directed by the director of public works.

c.  A TIA may be required any time a property owner seeks to rezone property that is not the subject of a POADP in a manner that would result in the PHT under the proposed zoning and use exceeding by more than 100 PHT the maximum PHT that could have been generated by uses permitted in the existing zoning, or results in a TIA level different from that derived from the existing zoning. 
d.  The requirement to perform a TIA under subsection (2) or (3) of this section shall not apply if the existing zoning is a temporary zoning resulting from annexation. 
e.  A POADP or other permit, as defined by V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 245.001 et seq., that is altered or modified as a result of a city requirement base don information provided in compliance with this division will not be considered to have been initiated by the property owner of its representative for the purpose of interpreting or enforcing this Code.

(Ord. No. 2018-28, § 1, 9-25-2018) 
Sec. 102-103. - Tree replacement calculation. 
(a)  Tree replacement calculations are based upon the following guiding principles: 
(1)  Greater value is placed on protected trees of greater size, therefore caliper inch replacement is increased as the size of each tree increases; 
(2)  Greater value is placed on maintaining trees on-site, therefore caliper inch replacement is increased if replacement occurs off-site or through payment in lieu of replacement; 
(3)  Greater value is placed on maintaining large or interconnected conservation areas, therefore exceptions and incentives are available to maintain these areas; 
(4)  Invasive tree species harm the native tree canopy, therefore incentives are available for elimination of species shown in the invasive tree list in this article; and, 
(5)  Protection and maintenance of the community's tree canopy is more critical than equal replacement of individual trees, therefore replacement calculations result in a total number of caliper inches to be replaced as measured following application of the above principles. 
(b)  The diameter at breast height of each protected tree to be removed from the site shall be measured to determine size in caliper inches. 
(c)  Replacement of removed trees shall be achieved utilizing one of the following three methods, in accordance with the applicant's written election: 
(1)  On-site replacement in accordance to all standards and requirements of the city; 
(2)  Off-site replacement in parks, dedicated conservation areas or selected rights-of-way at the direction of the city planner or city arborist; or 
(3)  Payment in lieu of replacement to the city reforestation and tree management fund to be used for public reforestation and maintenance of protected trees on public property or significant trees on public or private property. 
(d)  Caliper inch replacement of each protected tree shall be calculated in accordance with table XX. 
Table XX. Caliper Inch Replacement of a Protected Tree On Site Replacement Off Site Replacement or 
Payment in Lieu Small Trees 6" to 9" 100 percent 120 percent 9.1" to 12" 100 percent 130 percent Greater than 12" 130 percent 140 percent Large Trees 12" to 15" 100 percent 120 percent 15.1" to 18" 100 percent 130 percent Greater than 18" 130 percent 140 percent  
(e)  Payment in lieu shall be calculated at a rate of $250.00 per caliper inch of required replacement tree(s). 
(f)  The city planner or city arborist shall have the discretion to reduce tree replacement requirements the removal of invasive trees on-site or off-site in accordance with standards established by the city arborist. Reduction of caliper inch replacement if granted shall be calculated in accordance with table XY.

(b)  Tree topping. Topping (also referred to as heading, stubbing, rounding or dehorning) of any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public property is prohibited. Topping involves the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. The city manager, upon the recommendation of the city arborist, may specifically authorize in writing topping of a specific tree, based on clear evidence of extraordinary circumstances that justify topping. Extraordinary circumstances may include but not be limited to, trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical. 
(c)  Pruning, corner clearance. The owner(s) of any tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within the city shall prune the branches so that such branches shall not obstruct the light from any street light or obstruct the view of any street sign or intersection, and so that there shall be a clear space of 15 feet above the surface of the street and/or sidewalk. Pruning includes crown cleaning, thinning, raising, reduction, and restoration. The pruning of trees must comply with tree trimming guidelines in the American National Standard for Tree Care Operations: Tree Shrub and Other Woody Plant Maintenance Standard Practices, or National Arborist Association's "Standards for Pruning of Shade Trees." Said owners shall also remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the public. 
(d)  If the property owner fails to prune trees to provide clearances stated, the city arborist is authorized to notify the owners of such trees in writing of their responsibility. Pruning shall be done by said owners at their own expense within ten days after the date of service of notice. In the event of failure of owners to comply with such provisions, the city shall have the authority to prune such trees and charge the cost of removal to the owners. 
(e)  Removal of dead or diseased trees on private property. A tree disposition permit is required to remove a protected tree. The city shall have the right to cause the removal of any dead or diseased trees on private property within the city, when such trees constitute a hazard to life and property, or harbor insects or disease which constitute a potential threat to other trees within the city. The city shall notify in writing the owners of such trees. Removal shall be done by said owners at their own expense within 30 days after the date of service of notice. In the event of failure of owners to comply with such provisions, the city shall have the authority to remove such trees and charge the cost of removal to the owners. 
(f)  Emergency removal provision. If the city arborist determines that a tree poses an imminent threat, the city may secure the surrounding area and/or remove the hazardous tree. 
(g)  Removal of stumps. Street and park trees that are removed shall have their stumps ground to grade level or removed. 
(Ord. No. 2018-28, § 1, 9-25-2018)

If centering within the planting strip is not possible or desirable due to design considerations, the tree must be located at least two feet from the sidewalk edge or the curb edge. Trees within the city rights-of-way shall not be planted where the rooting space is less than four feet in width without prior approval of the city arborist. The minimum width of a planting site for each tree will be governed by the approved street tree list. Trees that commonly produce a large-buttress root system shall be planted in a site greater than ten feet wide (i.e., Quercus species). On public streets without sidewalks, trees shall be located to accommodate future sidewalk placement and, current and future utility line corridors. 
(b)  Tree root barriers shall be installed when new trees are planted to prevent uncontrollable spread of tree roots that may cause damage to hardscape/ infrastructure (sidewalks, driveways, storm sewers, streets). Root barriers may be either linear or surround in form, depending on the hardscape/infrastructure to be protected, and must be installed at a minimum depth of 30 inches.

Sec. 106-62. - Eligibility for abatement.

(b)  Authorized facilities. A facility may be eligible for tax abatement if it is a business or manufacturing facility, research facility, distribution center, regional service facility, a basic industry, or a facility that is deemed essential to the city's growth and that meets the guidelines of V.T.C.A., Tax Code Chapter 312, as amended. 
(c)  Creation of new value. Tax abatement may only be granted for the additional value of eligible property improvements made subsequent to and specified in a tax abatement agreement between the city and the property owner, subject to such limitations as the city may require. 
(d)  New and existing facilities. Tax abatement may be granted for new facilities and improvements to existing facilities for purposes of modernization or expansion. 
(e)  Eligible property. Tax abatement may be extended to the value of buildings, structures, fixed machinery and equipment, site improvements, office space and related fixed improvements, and business personal property necessary to the operation and administration of the facility. 
(f)  Ineligible property. The following types of property shall be fully taxable and ineligible for tax abatement: land, supplies, tools, deferred maintenance investments, improvements for the generation or transmission of electrical energy not wholly consumed by a new facility or expansion; any improvements, including those to produce, store, or distribute natural gas, fluids or gases, which are not integral to the operation of the facility; property that has productive life of less than 15 years; and property owned or used by the State of Texas or any of its political subdivisions or by any organization owned, operated, or directed by a political subdivision of the State of Texas. Nevertheless, the city council may consider this property to be eligible upon a vote of two-thirds of the city council if otherwise in compliance with law. 
(g)  Value and term of tax abatement. 
(1)  Tax abatement shall be granted effective with the January 1 valuation date immediately following the date of execution of the agreement between the city and the property owner. Up to 100 percent of the value of new eligible properties shall be abated for up to two years during the period of construction and for up to eight years thereafter, as herein provided. The abatement may be extended through an initial agreement and a subsequent agreement. If the period of construction exceeds two years, the facility shall be considered completed for purposes of abatement and in no case shall the period of abatement inclusive of construction and completion exceed ten years unless it is in conformity with state law and approved by the vote of two-thirds of the city council. 
(2)  In the event the applicant plans the removal in whole or in part of existing improvements in connection with the construction of new eligible properties, the maximum level tax abatement shall be reduced from the 100 percent level provided for herein. The percentage of the value of such eligible properties that shall be abated shall be found as follows: ascertain the appraised value of the improvements to be removed as of January 1 immediately preceding the date of application, subtract that appraised value from the amount of the eligible properties to be constructed, and then divide the remainder by the amount of eligible properties to be constructed. 
(h)  Economic qualifications. To be eligible for designation as a reinvestment zone and receive tax abatement, and at the city council's sole discretion to receive tax abatement of the planned improvement, the planned development shall, unless otherwise qualified or eligible under subsections (i) or (j): 
(1)  Entail the expenditure of $2,000,000.00 for the construction of improvements on eligible property, if it is within a concentration of tourist related business activities and that the project would enhance neighboring tourist related businesses; or 
(2)  Entail the expenditure of $5,000,000.00 in phased development over ten years where there is a showing of a high likelihood that the phased development will be completed by a financially solvent developer in a development that the city council deems essential for the growth of the City of League City. 
(i)  Abatement for projects that employ at least seven people. Up to 50 percent of increased value may be abated on projects that create full-time employment for at least seven additional people on a permanent basis in the City of League City or provide at least seven retained full-time jobs, and the total expenditures for the improvements on eligible property exceeds $500,000.00. 
(j)  Abatement for projects that employ at least 15 people. Up to 100 percent of increased value may be abated on projects that create employment for at least 15 additional people on a permanent basis [in the City of] League City or provide at least 15 retained jobs, and the total expenditures for the improvements on eligible property must exceed $1,000,000.00. 
(k)  Taxability. From the execution of the abatement to the end of the agreement period, taxes shall be payable as follows: 
(1)  The value of ineligible property, as provided in the preceding section 106-62(f), shall be fully taxable; 
(2)  The base year value of existing eligible property as determined each year shall be fully taxable; and 
(3)  The additional value of new eligible property shall be taxable in the same manner described in the preceding section 106-62(g). 
(l)  Galveston County employment. When desired, the applicant and its contractors may employ in the construction phase and afterwards in facility operations, supervisory and administrative personnel as deemed most suitable, wherever located. All things being equal, however, preferential treatment shall be given to hiring operators and construction workers residing in Galveston County, in the construction phase of the facility and also during operations thereafter. This requirement for preferential treatment for Galveston County workers and operators may be waived on the showing of undue hardship upon the developer and upon a vote of two-thirds of the city council.

(b)  The application shall be signed by the owner accompanied by:

    At its sole discretion, the city may elect to administer, design, engineer and construct utility service extensions or improvements in areas within the city by assessing up to 90 percent of the total cost of such extensions or improvements against the benefited or intervening residential property owners in such proportionate shares as the city deems just and equitable. The following standards shall apply when the city elects to make utility service extensions or improvements under this section: 
(1)  A minimum of 50 percent of the property owners who will benefit, intervene or take service from the extensions or improvements (referred to in this section as "the project") must agree, through execution of a written agreement with the city, to pay their proportionate shares of the total project costs within the period of time determined by the city council. Such agreements must be executed before the city shall begin construction of the project. 
(2)  The city council shall determine the terms of payment, including payment in a lump sum or over a specified period of time, by the benefited or intervening residential property owners on a project-by-project basis. 
(3)  If city council determines that terms of payment pursuant to agreements to pay for project costs by property owners shall be over a specified period of time, property owners shall pay their proportionate shares of the total project costs plus interest at an annual rate established by the city council on a project-by-project basis. At the time the terms of payment pursuant to agreements are determined, city council also shall determine the annual rate of interest to be paid by property owners who do not execute an agreement with the city but desire to obtain service from the project after payment of all costs and fees as set forth in subsection (5) of this section. 
(4)  If the city does not own publicly dedicated rights-of-way or easements sufficient for construction and maintenance of the project, all property owners executing an agreement with city in connection with the project must donate sufficient rights-of-way or easements on their property or contribute funds to pay for their proportionate shares of the cost of acquisition of right-of-way or easement costs for the project. 
(5)  Before actually obtaining service from the project, all property owners who have not executed an agreement with the city and who desire to obtain service from the project at any time must pay their proportionate shares of the project costs, including interest, which interest shall run from the date the terms of payment pursuant to agreements were determined, until payment in full of their proportionate shares of project costs. All property owners, including those executing agreements, must pay all other fees as set by city ordinance or resolution before actually obtaining service from the project. Such fees shall include but are not limited to connection fees, capital maintenance fees and capital recovery fees. 
(6)  All property owners must, at their sole cost and expense, construct and connect utility service lines on their property which are necessary to connect to the project. 
(Code 1968, § 26-123; Ord. No. 87-09, § 3, 2-26-1987; Ord. No. 2003-02, § 2, 2-25-2003) 
Sec. 114-194. - Assessment of costs against benefited or intervening commercial property owners. 
    At its sole discretion, the city may elect to administer, design, engineer and construct utility service extensions or improvements in areas within the city by assessing not less than 60 percent of the total cost of such extensions or improvements against the benefited or intervening commercial property owners in such proportionate shares as the city deems just and equitable. The following standards shall apply when the city elects to make utility service extensions or improvements under this section: 
(1)  There are no minimum percentage participation levels required of commercial property owners who will benefit, intervene, or take service from the utility service extension or improvement (referred to in this section as "the project"). 
(2)  All benefited or intervening commercial property owners who do not agree to participate in the project shall be assessed a frontage charge based upon the project costs, plus interest at an annual rate established by the city counsel on a project-by- project basis. 
(3)  Any and all assessments shall be due and payable upon application to the city for utility service. 
(4)  All funds paid to the city for assessments shall be divided between the city and the original developer based upon the percentage of the project costs borne by each party. The city may elect to participate in the cost of the project up to a maximum of 40 percent but in no instance to exceed the sum of $25,000.00 per project. 
(5)  The maximum length of time for repayment of costs to the original developer shall not exceed ten years. 
(6)  In order to encourage commercial development, the city will pay for the first 100 feet of extensions which are necessary to connect to the project. Thereafter, the property owner or developer must construct and connect any additional utility service lines on said property at their sole cost and expense. 
(7)  Further, the city will pay for all over-sizing and necessary intervening appurtenances such as fire hydrants required for the project.

Editor's note- Exhibit "A" is not set out herein, but is on file with the city. 
Sec. 114-228. - Criteria for initiation and termination of drought response stages. 
    The director of public works shall monitor water supply and demand conditions on a daily basis and determine when conditions warrant initiation or termination of each stage of the plan, that is, when the specified "triggers" are reached. 
    The triggering criteria described below are based on the city's ability to receive water from the Gulf Coast Water Authority (GCWA) and/or any other entity in which an inter-local agreement for water supply exists. 
(1)  Stage 1 triggers - MILD water shortage conditions. 
a.  Requirements for initiation. Customer shall be requested to voluntarily conserve water and adhere to the prescribed restrictions on certain water uses, as defined in this policy, when: 
1.  Water demand for the city is 75 percent of the available contracted surface water sources for three consecutive days. Water demand could be citywide or in a specified portion of the system; or 
2.  City wells are producing at 50 percent of their capacity to augment an inadequate supply of contracted surface water for three consecutive days; or 
3.  The city's water treatment or the city's supplier's treatment or delivery system becomes contaminated or is unable to process supply of water; or 
4.  The city's water demand for all or part of the delivery system approaches delivery capacity because delivery capacity is inadequate; or 
5.  The city's water supply system is unable to deliver water due to the failure or damage of major water system components. 
b.  Requirements for termination. Stage 1 of the plan may be rescinded when all of the conditions listed as triggering events have ceased to exist for a period of seven consecutive days. The director of public works shall have discretion based on total water usage during stage 1 to continue in voluntary stage until usage returns to average daily use. 
(2)  Stage 2 triggers - SEVERE water shortage conditions. 
a.  Requirements for initiation. Stage 2 water shortage shall be declared by the director of public works, or his/her designee, with the requirements and restrictions on certain non-essential water usages for stage 2 of this plan when: 
1.  Total daily water demand equals or exceeds 80 percent of the available surface water capacity for three consecutive days; or 
2.  Total daily water demand equals or exceeds 90 percent of the current available surface water capacity on a single day; or 
3.  A major failure of any transmission line within the system is out of service for a ten-hour period; or 
4.  The city's water treatment or distribution system becomes contaminated, in-operable or is reduced in any way from its full treatment capacity; or 
5.  The city's water demand for all or part of the delivery system approaches delivery capacity because delivery capacity is inadequate; or 
6.  The city's water supply system is unable to deliver water due to the failure or damage of major water system components. 
b.  Requirements for termination. Stage 2 of the plan may be rescinded when all of the conditions listed as triggering events have ceased to exist for a period of seven consecutive days. However, should, in the opinion of the director of public works, that rescinding the stage 2 condition could cause excessive usage during drought condition as identified by the National Weather Service for the area encompassing the city, and then a stage 2 may be left active until the drought condition is lifted and/or the major water suppliers to the city no longer remain under mandatory water rationing. Upon termination of stage 2, stage 1 becomes operative. 
(3)  Stage 3 triggers - EMERGENCY water shortage conditions. 
a.  Requirements for initiation. Customers shall be required to comply with the requirements and restrictions for stage 3 of this plan when the director of public works, or his/her designee, or their respective designee, determines that a water supply emergency exists based on: 
1.  Major waterline breaks, or pump or system failures occur which cause unpredictable loss of capability to provide water service; or 
2.  Natural or man-made contamination of the water supply source(s); or 
3.  The city's water demand for all or part of the delivery system approaches delivery capacity because delivery capacity is inadequate; or 
4.  When the total daily water demand equals or exceeds 95 percent, and/or the system pressure falls below 40 pounds per square inch. 
b.  Requirements for termination. Stage 3 of the plan may be rescinded when all of the conditions listed as triggering events have ceased to exist.

(3)  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is appealed unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies in writing to the board facts supporting the official's opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the board or a court of record on application, after notice to the official, if due cause is shown.

Sec. 125-47. - Variance. 
(a)  General. The zoning board of adjustment (the board) is authorized to permit variances from the regulations of this chapter in accordance with section 125-22. The board shall have the authority to grant upon such terms and conditions as it deems necessary. 
    Variance requests for all sections of this chapter are the responsibility of the applicant. Approval of a site development plan that deviates from the requirements of this chapter shall be void unless a variance has been specifically requested and approved in accordance with this chapter. 
    When an applicant shows that a provision of the regulations would cause practical difficulties, unnecessary hardship, or results are inconsistent with the general purpose of this chapter if strictly adhered to, and a departure may be made without destroying the intent of the regulations, the board may, at its sole discretion, authorize a variance that would be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter. Such departure shall not be construed to be a change in this chapter. However, the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done as follows: 
(1)  Permit such modification of the height area and yard requirements as may be necessary to secure an appropriate improvement on a lot; 
(2)  Permit the addition or enlargement of a non-conforming building, provided that such work complies with all height and area regulations of the zone in which it is located, and that the total aggregate floor area of such work does not exceed 50 percent of the floor area of the non-conforming building; 
(3)  Permit the extension of an existing or proposed conforming use into an adjoining more restricted zone; 
(4)  Permit the modification of the conditions under which specific uses are allowed in certain zones; 
(5)  Permit the modification of the automobile parking or loading requirements where, in the particular instance, such modification will not be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter; and 
(6)  Permit the repair of an existing non-conforming building as long as the value of the repairs do not exceed 50 percent of the appraised tax value. 
    The following adjustments must be present in order for the board to grant a variance: 
(1)  Such variance will not be contrary to public interest. 
(2)  Such variance will not authorize the operation of a use other than those uses specifically authorized for the district in which the property for which the variance is sought is located. 
(3)  Such variance will not substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use of adjacent conforming property in the same district. 
(4)  Such variance will not alter the essential character of the district in which it is located or the property for which the variance is sought. 
(5)  Such variance will be in harmony with the spirit and purposes of this chapter. 
(6)  The plight of the owner of the property for which the variance is sought is due to unique circumstances existing on the property, and the unique circumstances were not created by the owner of the property and are not merely financial, and are not due to, or the result of, general conditions in the district in which the property is located. 
(7)  The variance will not substantially weaken the general purposes of this chapter or the regulations herein established for the specific district. 
(8)  The variance will not adversely affect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. 
(b)  Application required. An application for a variance from the regulations of this chapter shall be filed with the planning department's established rules of procedure. An application may be filed by owner of the property or an authorized agent, or by the city planner or designee. 
(c)  Fee required. The appropriate filing fee shall accompany every application. No fee shall be charged for requests filed by the city planner or designee. 
(d)  Notice. After receiving a proper application, the city planner or designee will schedule a public hearing on the variance before the board. At least ten days prior to the hearing, written notice shall be sent to owners of real property lying within 500 feet of the property of which the variance is sought. Such notices shall be given in the same manner notice is given for a rezoning application.

Sec. 125-51. - Certificates of appropriateness. 
(a)  Generally. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, reconstruct, significantly alter, restore, remove or demolish any building or architectural feature of a building within an Historic Conservation Overlay District unless the work complies with a certificate of appropriateness then in effect, including any conditions and restrictions imposed by the commission. No other permits for such work may be issued unless a certificate, if required, has been issued. Exception: No certificate is required for work that only affects the interior of a building, not normally visible from a street. 
(1)  The standards for issuance of certificates of appropriateness are as follows: 
a.  All work must comply with applicable regulations of the preservation plan (including mandatory design guidelines) and this section. 
b.  Rehabilitation work must comply with the most-current version [of] Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings published by the United States Secretary of the Interior, including the following provisions (subject to any future revisions): 
1.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to adapt the property in a manner which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, object, or site and its environment. 
2.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, object or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
3.  All buildings, structures, objects, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
4.  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, object or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
5.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, object, or site shall be kept were possible. 
6.  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should reflect the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
7.  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historical building materials shall not be undertaken. 
8.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
9.  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
10.  Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to buildings, structures, objects or sites shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the building, structure, object or site would be unimpaired. 
c.  For demolition or removal, the applicant must prove a preponderance of the following factors: 
1.  Neither restoration nor repair is feasible, taking into account the condition of the building; 
2.  The cost of restoration or repair is unreasonable; 
3.  The building has little or no existing or potential usefulness, including economic usefulness; 
4.  The building is not important for maintaining the character of the district or for achieving the historic preservation purposes of this section. 
(b)  Procedures. Only the owner of a building may apply for a certificate of appropriateness. The application must include drawings, plans and other descriptions sufficient to communicate the nature of the work, and they must meet criteria for form, number of copies and content as may be prescribed by the historic commission. There is no application fee. Each application must be filed with the building official, who shall forward a copy to the historic preservation officer and the presiding officer of the historic commission promptly. Before or during review of an application, the applicant may consult the commission by appearing at a meeting. 
    The commission shall hold a hearing on each application after giving at least ten working days written notice to the applicant. In addition, a notice shall be posted: (i) at least 14 days prior to the hearing, (ii) at or near the principal entrance to the affected property, and (iii) so that it is clearly legible by a person standing within a street or other public way. The historic preservation officer shall prescribe the form of all notices. 
    After reviewing an application, if the commission finds the proposed work meets the standards for issuance, the commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. The commission may impose conditions and restrictions on a certificate, to the extent reasonably necessary to meet the standards for issuance. Otherwise, the commission shall disapprove the application. However, if the commission neither issues a certificate nor disapproves an application by the decision deadline, the historic preservation officer shall issue a certificate covering all the work applied for, without conditions or restrictions. The decision deadline is the 45th day following the date the application is filed (or, in case of an application including any major demolition or removal, the 90th day). In this paragraph, "major demolition or removal" means demolition or removal of 250 square feet or more of building space, measured by the affected floor area. 
    All descriptions of the work provided by the applicant (and any other representations made by the applicant) are deemed to be included in each certificate, regardless of whether they are attached or referenced, but are subject to the certificate and any conditions or restrictions imposed. 
    The historic preservation officer shall promptly notify the applicant and the building official of the disposition of each application. Building permits and other approvals are usually required, in addition to a certificate of appropriateness. 
    A person aggrieved by any action of the commission may appeal to the zoning board of adjustment. Appeals must be in writing and filed with the historic preservation officer not later than the 30th day following the day the applicant is notified of the action. The board shall give notices, hold a hearing and make a decision in the same manner as prescribed for commission action under this section. For this purpose, decision deadlines are measured from the date an appeal is filed with the historic preservation officer. 
(c)  Hardship appeals. 
(1)  A certificate of appropriateness may be issued because of economic hardship only if the applicant clearly demonstrates, at a public hearing, all of the following: 
a.  The applicant cannot earn a reasonable return on investment in the property (regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible); 
b.  Neither the current owner nor any other owner or tenant can adapt the property to comply with general zoning regulations and allow a reasonable return on investment; 
c.  The property owner has made diligent attempts to find a purchaser or tenant interested in acquiring or leasing the property and preserving it in compliance with historic preservation regulations, but all attempts have failed; and 
d.  The applicant has worked in good faith with the commission, any local preservation groups and other interested parties, in a diligent effort to seek an alternative that would result in preservation of the property.

(d)  Zoning district map. The boundaries of these base and overlay zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the official zoning map, which accompanies and is made part of this chapter. The city planner or designee shall be responsible for custody of the official zoning map and shall promptly make any changes approved by the city council. The provisions of an ordinance establishing a district, amending a district classification, or amending a district boundary shall control over any conflicting information shown on the official zoning map. The official zoning map, together with all notations, references, and other information shown thereon and all amendments thereto, shall be as much a part of this chapter as if fully set forth and described herein. The official zoning map, properly attested, is on file in the office of the city planner or designee and is fully accessible to the public during normal business hours. 
(e)  Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map accompanying and made a part of this chapter, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  In cases where a zoning district boundary line is given a position adjoining, coincident with, or within a street or alley or non-navigable stream, it shall be deemed to be in the center of the street, alley or stream, and if the actual location of such street, alley or stream varies slightly from the location as shown on the district map, then the actual location shall control. 
(2)  In cases where a zoning district boundary line is shown as being located a specific distance from a street line or other physical feature, this distance shall control. 
(3)  In cases where a zoning district boundary line is shown adjoining or coincident with a railroad, it shall be deemed to be in the center of the railroad right-of-way and distances measured from a railroad shall be measured from the center of the designated mainline track. 
(4)  Where the zoning district boundary lines are not otherwise indicated, and where the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the zoning district boundaries shall be considered to be the lot lines, and where the zoning districts designated on the official zoning map are bounded approximately by lot lines, said lot lines shall be considered to be the boundary of such zoning districts unless said boundaries are otherwise indicated on the map or by ordinance. 
(5)  In unsubdivided property, unless otherwise indicated, the zoning district boundary line on the official zoning map shall be determined by the use of the scale contained on such map. 
(6)  Zoning district boundary lines indicated as approximately following city limits shall be considered to follow the city limits. 
(7)  All water areas within the city limits are considered to be within a zoning district and controlled by applicable district regulations.

Sec. 125-70. - Residential single-family districts. 
    This section establishes regulations for five residential single-family zoning district types: Residential Single-Family 20 (RSF-20), Residential Single-Family 10 (RSF-10), Residential Single-Family 7 (RSF-7), Residential Single-Family 5 (RSF-5), and Residential Single-Family 2 (RSF-2). The development standards generally reflect current standards. 
(a)  Purposes. The specific purposes of the RSF Residential single-family districts are to create, maintain, and enhance neighborhood residential areas that are characterized by detached, single-unit structures with typical lot sizes ranging anywhere from 2,000 to 20,000 square feet in size. Future development must remain single-family residential in nature, although some attached single-family units, small-scale public, and non-residential uses may be permitted in certain districts. Five RSF Residential single-family districts are established: 
  RSF-20 Residential single-family. This district reflects existing "large lot" single-family areas of the city and is intended to provide for very low density suburban residential development. The minimum lot size is 20,000 square feet. 
  RSF-10 Residential single-family. This district reflects existing single-family areas of the city and is intended to provide for low density suburban residential development. The minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet. 
  RSF-7 Residential single-family. This district reflects existing single-family areas of the city and is intended to provide for medium density residential development. The minimum lot size is 7,000 square feet. This district is intended to replace the existing SD-R Suburban development-residential district in undeveloped areas of the city. 
  RSF-5 Residential single-family. This district reflects existing single-family areas of the city and is intended to provide for medium density residential development. The minimum lot size is 5,000 square feet. Zero-lot line and attached single-family units are permitted. Mobile homes are conditionally permitted but are regulated as a special use in this district. 
  RSF-2 Residential single-family. This district is intended to provide for high density, small lot single-family residential development with a minimum lot size of 2,000 square feet. Zero-lot line units are permitted. 
(b)  Land use regulations. Schedule 125-70.B. below prescribes the land use regulations for RSF residential single family districts. The regulations for each district are established by letter designations as follows: 
"P" designates permitted use classifications. 
"L" designates use classifications that are permitted, subject to certain limitations prescribed by the additional use regulations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. Number designations refer to the specific limitations listed at the end of Schedule 125-70.B. 
"S" designates use classifications permitted after review and approval of a special use permit by the city council. These uses are also subject to certain limitations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. 
Use classifications are defined in article V, division 1: Use classifications. In cases where a specific land use or activity is not defined, the city planner or designee shall assign the land use or activity to a classification that is substantially similar in character. Use classifications not listed in the schedule below are prohibited.

Commercial and mixed use areas are typically located on or near the city's major arterial roads and represent a range of development scales and intensities that may include residential uses where appropriate. Four C commercial and mixed use districts are established: 
  CN neighborhood commercial. This district is intended to provide for areas of smaller-scaled and pedestrian-oriented neighborhood-serving commercial and mixed use development (typically with floorplates of less than 10,000 square feet) that includes retail, services, office, eating and drinking, housing, smaller-scaled public uses, etc. 
  CG general commercial. This district reflects existing and future areas of larger-scaled pedestrian- and auto-oriented commercial development (typically with floorplates of more than 10,000 square feet) located on the city's major arterial roads and include a wide variety of community-serving uses that include retail, services, office, auto-related businesses, eating and drinking, recreation and entertainment, public and semi-public uses, etc. Residential uses are not permitted in this district. 
  CO commercial office. This district is intended to provide for areas of large-scale integrated professional office development of quality design in a landscaped setting serving high technology, and research and development. Secondary support uses-such as business services and institutional uses-serving the development are encouraged. 
  CM commercial mixed use. This district is intended to provide for areas of large-scale pedestrian- and auto-oriented region-serving mixed use development that includes a mix of retail formats (both large and small), office and business services, commercial lodging, office-oriented research and development, recreation and entertainment, etc. Multi-family residential uses are permitted in this district. Development in this district will occur under a master development plan. 
(b)  Land use regulations. Schedule 125-72.B below prescribes the land use regulations for C commercial and mixed use districts. The regulations for each district are established by letter designations as follows: 
"P" designates permitted use classifications.

Sec. 125-73. - Industrial districts. 
    This section establishes regulations for two industrial district types: Limited Industrial (IL) and General Industrial (IG). 
(a)  Purposes. The specific purposes of the I industrial districts are to create, maintain, and enhance industrial areas that serve as important employment generators while protecting the function of such industrial areas from the encroachment of potentially incompatible land uses, and protecting adjacent land use from adverse impacts from industrial uses. Industrial areas are typically located on or near the city's major arterial roads and may require rail access. Two I industrial districts are established: 
  IL limited industrial. This district is intended to provide for areas of large-scale industrial development with limited off-site impacts, including research and development, high technology, biotechnology, small-scale distribution, and activities requiring flexible floorspace. Secondary support uses-such as office, business services, and institutional uses-are encouraged. Such development will be screened and buffered from adjacent commercial and residential districts. Development in this district will occur under a unified plan. 
  IG general industrial. This district is intended to provide for areas of large-scale industrial development with potentially significant off-site impacts, including manufacturing, processing, and assembly; warehouse and distribution; large equipment supply and sales; etc. Such uses may occur outside buildings and may require heavy truck and/or rail access. Such development will be screened and buffered from adjacent commercial and residential districts. 
(b)  Land use regulations. Schedule 125-73.B. below prescribes the land use regulations for I industrial districts. The regulations for each district are established by letter designations as follows: 
"P" designates permitted use classifications. 
"L" designates use classifications that are permitted, subject to certain limitations prescribed by the additional use regulations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. Number designations refer to the specific limitations listed at the end of Schedule 125-73.B. 
"S" designates use classifications permitted after review and approval of a special use permit by the city council. These uses are also subject to certain limitations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. 
Use classifications are defined in article V, division 1: Use classifications. In cases where a specific land use or activity is not defined, the city planner or designee shall assign the land use or activity to a classification that is substantially similar in character. Use classifications not listed in the schedule below are prohibited.

DIVISION 3. - OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 125-80. - -PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District. 
(a)  Purposes. The -PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District is intended to encourage high quality development in the city by providing additional flexibility in the planning and development of projects. Such flexibility is intended to result in development that is more efficient, environmentally sensitive, visually pleasing, safe, and socially integrated than traditional zoning might provide. The -PUD Overlay District is also meant to provide the city with the ability to better manage development in areas that are adjacent to residential development. The specific purposes of the -PUD Overlay District are to: 
 Establish a procedure for the development of land under unified controls to increase flexibility from the strict application of land use regulations, development standards, and procedures intended primarily for individual lots; 
 Ensure orderly and thorough review procedures that will result in quality design, protection of open space and sensitive areas, and the creation and improvement of common open space and pedestrian and bicycle circulation, particularly in residential areas; 
 Achieve efficient land use patterns while permitting creative and innovative approaches to the development of urban and suburban residential, commercial, and industrial land; 
 Encourage mixed development patterns, architectural styles, and building forms to avoid monotony in large developments by allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access light, open space, amenities; and 
 Provide for flexibility in the strict application of certain of the land use regulations and performance standards found in the base zoning districts to take advantage of special site characteristics, location, and/or land uses. 
 Consider the impact on adjacent developed properties, particularly residential areas, and enter into a documented dialog to address their issues and concerns. 
 All -PUD Overlay Districts shall have an underlying zoning designation. 
(b)  Zoning map designator. A -PUD Overlay District will be combined with the base zoning district(s) applied to the area and will be shown on the zoning map by a -PUD designator applied to the base district(s) designation. 
(c)  Applicability. The applicability of the -PUD Overlay District shall be as follows: 
(1)  Allowable locations. No -PUD Overlay District may be applied to an area of the city that is not served by critical infrastructure, such as potable water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, and paved streets, except where one or more of such services not currently in place is included in the city's master plan for installation or construction within a three-year period from the date of the application for a planned unit development. In addition, no -PUD Overlay District may be applied to an area that is located more than one-mile from a major arterial street, as designated by the city planner or designee, or shown on the master transportation plan. 
(2)  Minimum area. No -PUD Overlay district may be applied to a land area less than five-acres for residential development and two-acres for non-residential development. 
(d)  Land use regulations. Any use authorized in article III, division 2: Base district regulations, may be included in a -PUD Overlay District, provided such use is consistent with the land use concepts in the comprehensive plan for the area to be included in the -PUD Overlay District, and is not disruptive or inconsistent with current neighboring development, particularly residential areas. Existing uses are permitted and may continue. All uses in the -PUD Overlay District shall be in accordance with the master plan approved for the district (refer to subsection (h)). 
(e)  Development regulations. The total number of dwelling units in a -PUD Overlay District shall not exceed that permitted by the comprehensive plan density for the total area of parcels designated for residential use. Other development regulations, such as for building scale, building form and location, pedestrian orientation, parking accommodation, open space and landscaping, and other standards shall be as prescribed by the development plan approved for the district and may depart from conformance with the standards specified in the base zoning district where the -PUD Overlay District is applied if specifically approved by the planning and zoning commission and/or city council. 
(f)  Initiation. A -PUD Overlay District may be initiated by a property owner or authorized agent, the planning and zoning commission, or the city council. If the property is not under a single ownership, then all owners shall join in the application and a map showing the extent of ownerships shall be submitted with concept plans and materials. 
(g)  Criteria for consideration of -PUD Overlay District application. The planning and zoning commission shall consider an application for rezoning to a -PUD Overlay District as prescribed under section 125-49 and shall at the same time consider a proposed concept plan for the area. A recommendation of the planning and zoning commission to rezone to a -PUD Overlay District shall be accompanied by a resolution recommending approval of the concept plan. In addition to the criteria for considering an application for a zoning map amendment under section 125-49, the planning and zoning commission shall recommend approval or conditional approval of the concept plan to the city council upon finding that: 
(1)  The concept plan is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and other applicable policies and is compatible with surrounding development; 
(2)  The concept plan will enhance the potential for superior urban design and amenities in comparison with the development under the base district regulations that would apply if the concept plan were not approved; 
(3)  Deviations from the base district regulations that otherwise would apply are justified by compensating benefits of the concept plan; and 
(4)  The concept plan includes adequate provisions for utilities, services, and emergency vehicle access; and public service demands will not exceed the capacity of existing and planned systems. See the adequate public facilities ordinance for these requirements. 
Refer to subsection (i) for the requirements of a concept plan. 
(h)  Procedures for -PUD Overlay District application. In addition to the procedures for an application for a zoning map amendment under section 125-49, an application for rezoning to a -PUD Overlay District shall be processed in the following manner. 
(1)  Pre-application conference. Prior to submitting an application for a planned unit development, the prospective applicant shall request a review by the city planner or designee and representatives from other city departments, as appropriate, to discuss the prospective development with respect to compatibility with existing and anticipated land uses in the vicinity and the city's adopted planning rationale. The pre-application conference is intended to guide the prospective applicant in the preparation of a concept plan to be submitted for planning and zoning commission consideration and city council approval. There is no fee associated with a request for a pre-application conference; however, additional requests for a pre-application conference for the same site within a period of one-year from the date of the initial conference may incur a fee associated with any city costs to do so. 
(2)  Submission and approval of concept plan. The applicant shall submit a concept plan (bubble plan) as part of the application for rezoning to a -PUD Overlay District, the required contents of which are noted in subsection (i) below. The city planner or designee shall prepare a written report on the concept plan that will summarize the anticipated impacts of the proposed development on planning goals, utilities, emergency services, vehicular traffic, taxes, and properties within a 500-foot distance of the site for which the development is proposed. The concept plan, a list of requested variances, and report by the city planner or designee shall be submitted for consideration by the planning and zoning commission and recommendation to city council. Upon approval by city council of the concept plan, the applicant may proceed with the preparation of a master plan and proceed to subsequent steps for approval with reasonable assurance that if the agreed upon concept is carried forth, then preliminary and final plat approvals will be granted by the city. Following approval of the concept plan by city council, the applicant shall prepare a master plan, the required contents of which are noted in subsection (i) below. Recommendation for approval or denial of a -PUD Overlay District shall be made by the planning and zoning commission and approved or denied by city council. 
(3)  Approval of master plan. After city council has approved the -PUD Overlay District, then the applicant shall submit a master plan for consideration and approval by the planning and zoning commission. The applicant may proceed with platting after approval of the master plan. The master plan must not have more than a 15 percent change in the land use or a significant change in geographic location from the previously approved concept plan for the -PUD Overlay District. Changes that alter the uses permitted by more than 15 percent and/or have a significant change in geographic location shall require submittal of a revised concept plan to be considered and approved by the commission and city council via a public hearing and notified in the same manner as a text or map amendment. When determining whether or not a "PUD" development has exceeded 15 percent and should be considered by city council, each of the following shall be considered: 
a.  The total acreage change in the "PUD" development based on the original concept plan document. The concept plan establishes the land use acreages, and represents the baseline in determining the percentage of change. (Example: In a 100-acre "PUD", an increase of ten acres of residential and a decrease of ten acres of commercial is still a total change of ten acres and the percentage of change of the total acreage is ten percent.) 
b.  Percentage of change (increased or decreased) within each land use category based on the original concept plan document. For residential uses, the density units per acre shall also be calculated. (Example: In a 100-acre "PUD", a decrease from 15 to ten acres in the residential land use category represents a five percent change in acreage. However, an increase in density units per acre (dua) from 100 dua to 150 dua represents a 50 percent density increase.) 
c.  Intangibles such as re-locating a thoroughfare shown on the transportation plan, changing the general concept or changing the location of uses that may not necessarily have anything to do with the acreage of land uses per se, but may be just as important in evaluating whether or not a "PUD" should be reconsidered by the commission and city council. 
(4)  Lapse of approval and renewal of master plan. A master plan shall be effective on the date the ordinance creating the -PUD Overlay District is approved and shall expire after two years unless a building permit has been issued and a vested right established. An approved master plan may specify a development staging program exceeding two years. The planning and zoning commission may recommend, and the city council may review, a master plan for a period of up to two years if it finds the renewal consistent with the purposes of this section. Application for renewal shall be made in writing to the city planner or designee not less than 30 days or more than 120 days prior to expiration. 
(5)  Revisions to master plan. Changes to the master plan that do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property; do not alter the uses permitted or increase the density, building height or coverage of the site; do not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site; and do not significantly alter the landscape plans or signage as indicated on the approved development may be recommended by the city planner or designee and approved by the planning and zoning commission. The master plan must not have more than a 15 percent change in the land use or a significant change in geographic location from the previously approved concept plan for the -PUD Overlay District. Changes that alter the uses permitted by more than 15 percent and/or have a significant change in geographic location shall require submittal of a revised concept plan to be considered and approved by the commission and city council via a public hearing and notified in the same manner as a text or map amendment. When determining whether or not a "PUD" development has exceeded 15 percent and should be considered by city council, each of the following shall be considered: 
a.  The total acreage change in the "PUD" development based on the original concept plan document. The concept plan establishes the land use acreages, and represents the baseline in determining the percentage of change. (Example: In a 100-acre "PUD", an increase of ten acres of residential and a decrease of ten acres of commercial is still a total change of ten acres and the percentage of change of the total acreage is ten percent.) 
b.  Percentage of change (increased or decreased) within each land use category based on the original concept plan document. For residential uses, the density units per acre shall also be calculated. (Example: In a 100-acre "PUD", a decrease from 15 to ten acres in the residential land use category represents a five percent change in acreage. However, an increase in density units per acre (dua) from 100 dua to 150 dua represents a 50 percent density increase.) 
c.  Intangibles such as re-locating a thoroughfare shown on the transportation plan, changing the general concept or changing the location of uses that may not necessarily have anything to do with the acreage of land uses per se, but may be just as important in evaluating whether or not a "PUD" should be reconsidered by the commission and city council. 
(6)  Annual report. The developer shall submit an annual progress report to the city planner by September 1 of each year for review and acceptance. The report shall contain a discussion of the development schedule and any deviations from the originally approved schedule. The city planner shall refer the annual report to the planning and zoning commission and the city council for review. Acceptance of the annual report by the city planner or designee is required prior to any staff review of any aspect of the -PUD Overlay District project, including building permits and revisions. 
(i)  Required plans and materials. An application for rezoning to a -PUD Overlay District requires the approval of a concept plan by city council and approval of a master plan by the planning and zoning commission. This section outlines the information required for each plan. 
(1)  Concept plan. The concept plan shall include the following information:

Sec. 125-81. - -RNC Residential Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District. 
(a)  Purposes. The -RNC Residential Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District is intended to encourage the conservation of the existing areas within the -RNC Overlay District which possess distinctive features, identity, and character worthy of retention and enhancement. The use regulations and development standards included in the -RNC Overlay District will facilitate neighborhood maintenance, upgrading, and the development of vacant or underutilized lots while reducing the potential for incompatible land uses. 
    The specific purposes of the -RNC Overlay District are: 
 To protect and enhance the historic and cultural character and traits of the area which make it unique, defined as an intimate scale, walkable neighborhoods, strong connectivity, and mixture of uses and public spaces that invite interaction and activity. 
 To preserve the old town culture and atmosphere and foster safe public use of the area through responsible public access planning, by encouraging beneficial use of public properties, and by establishing site design and architectural standards. 
(b)  Zoning map designator. The -RNC Overlay District will be combined with the base zoning district(s) and will be shown on the zoning map by an -RNC designator applied to the base district(s) designation. The -RNC Overlay District includes sub-areas in which more restrictive requirements apply (refer to sections 125-81.F et seq.). The boundaries of the those sub-areas, shall be shown on the zoning map, and they shall be considered separate districts under this article and V.T.C.A., Local Government Code Chapter 211. 
(c)  Applicability. 
(1)  Except as otherwise noted in this section, the regulations of the underlying base zoning district(s), and any other applicable overlay district, shall apply to property in the -RNC Overlay District. In the case of a conflict between the provisions of an underlying base zoning district and the -RNC Overlay District, the provisions of the -RNC Overlay District shall govern. 
(2)  In case of conflict with regulations applicable within a Historic Conservation Overlay District, the more restrictive regulations shall apply, except for non-mandatory guidelines and design recommendations. However, if a preservation plan makes specific exceptions from other regulations (or specifically relaxes other regulations), such specific provisions shall control over the other regulations. 
(d)  Land use regulations. Schedule 125-81.D below prescribes the land use regulations for the -RNC Residential Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District. The regulations for the RNC district are established by letter designations as follows: 
"P" designates permitted use classifications. 
"L" designates use classifications that are permitted, subject to certain limitations prescribed by the additional use regulations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. Number designations refer to the specific limitations listed at the end of Schedule 125-81.D. 
"S" designates use classifications permitted after review and approval of a special use permit by the city council. These uses are also subject to certain limitations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. 
Use classifications are defined in article V, division 1: Use classifications. In cases where a specific land use or activity is not defined, the city planner or designee shall assign the land use or activity to a classification that is substantially similar in character. Use classifications not listed in the schedule below are prohibited. Commercial uses permitted in Schedule 125-81.D shall only be allowed if currently permitted in the base zoning district, with the exception of bed and breakfast establishments which shall be permitted in any base zoning district.

Sec. 125-82. - -CRC Commercial Revitalization Overlay District. 
(a)  Purposes. The -CRC Commercial Revitalization Overlay District is intended to preserve the character of an established commercial corridor while providing opportunities for infill development that is consistent with and enhances the prevailing built character. The -CRC Overlay District applies to commercial development on the FM 518 corridor between Pecan Drive and FM 270, including the section of the corridor included in the -RNC Residential Neighborhood Conservation Overlay district established in section 125-81, and encourages small-scale commercial uses to locate nearer the street with parking located to the rear or side of buildings. The use regulations and development standards included in the -CRC Overlay District will facilitate neighborhood maintenance, upgrading, and the development of vacant or underutilized lots while reducing the potential for incompatible land uses. Circulation and access in the district will be consistent with the FM 518 Corridor Access Management Plan. 
(b)  Zoning map designator. The -CRC Overlay District will be combined with the base zoning district(s) applied to the area and will be shown on the zoning map by a -CRC designator applied to the base district(s) designation. 
(c)  Applicability. Except as otherwise noted in this section, the regulations of the underlying base zoning district(s), and any other applicable overlay district, shall apply to property in the -CRC Overlay District. In the case of a conflict between the provisions of an underlying base zoning district or other applicable overlay district and the -CRC Overlay District, the provisions of the -CRC Overlay District shall govern. 
(d)  Land use regulations. Schedule 125-82.D below prescribes the land use regulations for the -CRC Commercial Revitalization Overlay District. The regulations for the district are established by letter designations as follows:

Sec. 125-83. - -TND Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District. 
(a)  Purposes. The specific purposes of the -TND Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District are to: 
 Organize future large-scale residential development in the form of compact neighborhoods to discourage sprawl; 
 Design future residential development to ensure continuity in the citywide circulation network and connectivity between adjacent neighborhoods and major activity centers; 
 Encourage the development of neighborhood commercial centers proposed in the comprehensive plan and the associated residential development necessary to economically and socially support these centers; 
 Allow neighborhood-serving commercial uses to be within walking distance of the neighborhoods they serve; 
 Provide a range of housing types developed within close proximity so that a single neighborhood provides housing opportunities for all city residents; 
 Encourage built forms that add to the vitality and sense of place of the city's new neighborhoods and enhance business opportunities and property values; 
 Design neighborhood circulation systems and streetscapes that are safe, efficient, and pleasant for pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and automobile drivers; 
 Provide well designed, centrally located open space and public facilities of sufficient quantity and size to support the needs of neighborhood residents; and 
 Seamlessly integrate the private realm of businesses and dwellings with the public realm of streets, open space, and public and semi-public buildings to create cohesive neighborhoods. 
Three sub-districts are established under the -TND Overlay District. The additional purposes of each sub-district are: 
  Neighborhood Center (TND-NC). This sub-district provides opportunities for traditional small-scale "Main Street" retail and residential development. Development is scaled to the street and the pedestrian and is focused on a civic open space amenity, such as a square, plaza, boulevard, mall, common, or green. Neighborhood serving-retail activities continuously line pedestrian-oriented streets and allow residents to easily walk to multiple businesses; parking is provided on-street and/or behind buildings. Small-scale residential and office uses may be located on the upper stories of these buildings or in appropriately scaled single-use buildings at the edges of the sub-district. 
  Neighborhood Residential (TND-NR). This sub-district provides a mixture of single-, two-, and small-scale multi-family housing opportunities in the residential areas surrounding the Neighborhood Center. Housing is permitted in a variety of forms to allow occupancy by different household types and sizes. Residential architecture serves to frame, engage, and enliven the residential streets in a manner that adds to quality of life, personal safety, and property values. 
  Neighborhood Open Space (TND-NOS). This sub-district reflects a requirement that ten percent of a -TND Overlay District be established as open space. Open space should be provided both as a centrally located civic amenity, such as within the Neighborhood Center, as well as passive and active recreational amenities throughout the -TND Overlay District, such as squares, tot lots, greenways, play fields, and natural and preserves. 
(b)  Zoning map designator. A -TND Overlay District will be combined with the base zoning district(s) applied to the area and will be shown on the zoning map by a -TND designator applied to the base district(s) designation. 
(c)  Applicability. A -TND Overlay District may be applied as an alternative to future residential subdivision of any undeveloped or existing underutilized area designated for RSF residential single-family development that is between 40 and 260 acres in size. For land areas larger than 260 acres, additional -TND Overlay Districts will be required. In the case of a conflict between the provisions of an underlying base zoning district and the -TND Overlay District, the provisions of the -TND Overlay District shall govern. 
(d)  Land use regulations. Schedule 125-83.D below prescribes the land use regulations for the -TND Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District by sub-district. The regulations for each sub-district are established by letter designations as follows: 
"P" designates permitted use classifications. 
"L" designates use classifications that are permitted, subject to certain limitations prescribed by the additional use regulations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. Number designations refer to the specific limitations listed at the end of Schedule 125-83.D. 
"S" designates use classifications permitted after review and approval of a special use permit by the city council. These uses are also subject to certain limitations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. 
Use classifications are defined in article V, division 1: Use classifications. In cases where a specific land use or activity is not defined, the city planner or designee shall assign the land use or activity to a classification that is substantially similar in character. Use classifications not listed in the schedule below are prohibited.

(1)  Sub-district distribution. The -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district shall be a single contiguous sub-district located within the -TND Overlay District in order to maximize its geographic proximity to all neighborhood residents. The -NR Neighborhood Residential sub-district shall generally surround the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district. The -NOS Neighborhood Open Space sub-district need not be contiguous. At least ten percent of the required open space shall be fully bounded by the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district. All open space provided to satisfy the minimum requirement shall be accessible to the general public (refer to subsection N.). 
(f)  Building types. The -TND Overlay District uses building types to regulate development instead of land use designations. The following building types are permitted within the -TND Overlay District sub-districts as indicated in parenthesis: 
  Mixed use (-NC): A building containing retail, office, civic, residential, or a combination of these uses, and that actively addresses the street through transparency and little or no setback from the sidewalk and neighboring buildings. Non-residential uses are required on the ground floor; these uses are also permitted on upper floors. Mixed use buildings may face or abut on any side: apartment buildings, public and semi-public buildings, and neighborhood open space. Mixed use buildings may abut at the rear only: townhouse buildings, duplex buildings, and single-family buildings. 
  Apartment (-NR): A residential building containing three or more dwelling units on a single lot. Units may have individual exterior entrances or have interior entrances accessed from one or more exterior entrances. Apartment buildings may face or abut on any side: mixed use buildings, townhouse buildings, public and semi-public buildings, and neighborhood open space. Apartment buildings may abut at a corner or rear only: duplex buildings, and single-family buildings. 
  Townhouse (-NR): A dwelling unit on a single lot that is attached to or directly abuts similar adjacent houses so as to a create a consistent street wall. Townhouse buildings may face or abut on any side: duplex buildings, public and semi-public buildings, and neighborhood open space. Townhouse buildings may face and abut at the rear only: apartment buildings. Townhouse buildings may abut at the rear only: mixed use buildings, and single-family buildings. 
  Duplex (-NR): Two dwelling units attached at one lot line on separate lots, or vertically as two stacked flats on a single lot. Duplex buildings may face or abut on any side: townhouse buildings, single-family buildings, and neighborhood open space. Duplex buildings may abut at the rear only: mixed use buildings, apartment buildings, and public and semi-public buildings. 
  Single-family (-NR): A single unattached dwelling unit on a single lot. Single-family buildings may face or abut on any side: duplex buildings, and neighborhood open space. Single-family buildings may abut at the rear only: mixed use buildings, apartment buildings, townhouse buildings, and public and semi-public buildings. 
  Public and semi-public (-NC, -NR, -NOS): One or more buildings on single lot devoted to a public or semi-public purpose whose location, siting, and form express its purpose. Public and semi-public buildings may face or abut on any side: mixed use buildings, apartment buildings, townhouse buildings, and neighborhood open space. Public and semi-public buildings may abut at a corner or rear only: duplex buildings, and single-family buildings. 
In order to create greater diversity, the master plan for the district (refer to subsection (r) below) may identify additional building types consistent with but more specific than the regulations of this section. 
(g)  Building type distribution. The distribution of some building types is required within developable sub-districts. Schedule 125-83.G specifies the minimum distribution of non-residential building types as a proportion of land area and the minimum distribution of residential building types as a proportion of dwelling units. These requirements are intended to provide flexibility for the applicant while ensuring the diversity of building types necessary to support a viable neighborhood and neighborhood center. If development within a -TND Overlay District is completed in phases, each phase must meet the proportional distribution requirements presented in schedule 125-83.G.; "proportional" shall be determined by the city planner or designee.

(1)  Single-family residential. Single-family residential development within the -NR Neighborhood Residential sub-district shall reflect a range of building types. Although subsection (g) does not establish a minimum distribution of single-family residential building types, a variety of building types are permitted, including small-lot and patio homes. The master plan for the district (refer to subsection (r) below) shall identify the single-family residential building types proposed and their proportion of the total number of single-family residential units to be provided. 
(h)  Development regulations-All building types. Schedule 125-83.H. below prescribes the development regulations for the -TND Overlay District. The development regulations address building scale, building form and location, and other standards. No explicit standards are provided for stand-alone public and semi-public buildings, although these will be established by the approved master plan for the district (refer to subsection (r) below). Open space and other portions of the public realm, such as streets, landscaping, and parking, are regulated in the following sections. The number designations in right-hand column refer to the additional regulations listed at the end of schedule 125-83.H.

(2)  Maximum frontage. The maximum frontage standard shall apply separately to each public right-of-way adjacent to a lot. 
(3)  Minimum building height. Mixed use, apartment, and townhouse buildings shall be a minimum of two above-ground stories to provide a consistent street wall and a sense of enclosure of the public realm. 
(4)  Yards, front (minimum). In locations where a lot is adjacent to two public right-of-ways (e.g. a corner lot), the minimum front yard shall apply to both frontages. Stairs, stoops, porches, verandas, porticos, and other permanently unenclosed ground-level encroachments attached to primary building, including screened porches but excluding carports, porte cocheres, and other vehicular accommodations, are permissible and are encouraged in front yards. For building types with no minimum yard requirement, building features, such as awnings, porticos, bay windows, etc., may encroach into the adjacent public right-of-way provided that the encroachment does not interfere with the free movement of the public. A -TND Overlay District Master Plan may define how and where these encroachments may occur. 
(5)  Yards, front (maximum). At least 70 percent of a mixed use building shall be built to the front property line. Mixed use buildings may be setback up to 20 feet to permit outdoor seating areas for eating and drinking establishments or outdoor merchandise display areas. 
(6)  Yards, side (minimum). Single-family zero-lot line homes, also referred to as "side-yard" or "patio" homes, may have a zero-foot side yard on one side provided a ten-foot minimum side yard exists on the opposite side. A zero-lot line home's large side yard shall be adjacent to another zero-lot-line home or a public right-of-way. A perpetual easement related to maintenance, eaves, and drainage of at least four feet shall be provided the lot adjacent to the zero-lot line property which, with the exception of walls and fences, shall be kept clear of structures. 
(7)  Yards, side (maximum). For mixed use buildings, the side yard shall be no larger than necessary to accommodate vehicular access onto the site. 
(8)  Articulation and visual interest. Buildings shall be articulated both horizontally and vertically to break up of the facade and provide visual interest when viewed from the sidewalk. Structural and ornamental buildings features extending or retreating from the primary facade plane shall be designed to be substantial enough to cast shadows and provide visual depth. 
(9)  Entrance orientation. The primary entrance to all buildings shall be along the front facade of a building. Primary entrances shall be emphasized through entry features, such as porches, stoops, and awnings, building articulation, or other architectural techniques. If a building is setback from the front property line, a path shall be provided from the sidewalk to the front entry. 
(10)  Facade consistency. All facades visible from a public street shall have an appearance consistent with the front facade in terms of architectural form, material, and articulation. 
(11)  Equipment and garbage screening. All building systems and equipment shall be screened from public view by being located at the rear of a building, located on the roof out of public view, or being fully screened by the same materials as used in the primary facade. 
(12)  Fencing. Only non-opaque fencing shall be used, such as picket or rail fences where space is provided between fence pickets and/or rails, when visible from the street; such fencing shall be no taller than four feet and shall not continue across lot lines. Chain link fences shall only be permissible when not visible from a public street. Fences with barbs, razors, or spikes shall be prohibited. 
(i)  Development regulations-Mixed use buildings. The following regulations apply specifically to mixed use buildings.

(2)  Mixed use storefront continuity. A minimum 70 percent of ground floor building space along the principal building frontage shall have a retail storefront appearance. This requirement represents an average of the complete perimeter. At the edges of the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district, this requirement may be waived to permit buildings with a non-retail character on the ground floor; no more than 20 percent of development as measured by square feet of usable space within the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district shall be of this development type. 
(3)  Transparency. At least 50 percent of the ground floor facade shall be transparent. Views shall be provided by windows, window displays at least three feet deep, or doors in a zone of transparency of between two and eight feet above grade. Glass block shall not be considered transparent. Building transparency may be reduced by ten percent where building frontage exceeds of 50 feet. This requirement may be waived at the edge of the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district. 
(4)  Non-retail space. In mixed use buildings, non-retail, non-pedestrian-oriented uses, such as residences and professional offices shall be located on upper floors, in separate structures located at the rear of a retail building, or on the ground floor provided streetfront retail space with a minimum depth of 20 feet is provided. This requirement may be waived at the edge of the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district. 
(5)  Blank walls. No blank walls greater than 15 feet in length, excluding garage doors, are permitted on the streetfront. Building surfaces shall include an offset, recess, or projection providing shadows or visual interest for at least 25 percent of the frontage. 
(6)  Signage. Signage shall be scaled to pedestrians and attached to buildings as follows: 
a.  Signage letters and other elements attached to a building facade below the second floor elevation. 
b.  A single projecting sign over a sidewalk provided sign shall not be larger than three square feet on each side. 
c.  Signage letters and other elements imprinted onto an awning extending over a sidewalk. 
d.  No flashing, moving, or rear lit-signs are permitted. 
(7)  Driveway restrictions. Access shall be from a side street or rear service lane or alley wherever possible, but not from a residential street if alternate access is available. If access is not provided from a rear service lane or alley, a sole vehicular access point shall provide entrance to all parking facilities sufficient to accommodate necessary vehicular movement. 
(8)  Location of parking. If provided on-site, parking shall be located at the rear of the site or at the side of the building, except for drop-off areas which may be at the entry. Parking requirements may be satisfied through shared parking facilities. 
(9)  Parking lot landscaping. Shade trees shall be provided at a ratio of one tree for every six spaces. A minimum of ten percent of a surface parking lot shall be landscaped accompanied by an irrigation system that is permanent, below-grade, and activated by automatic timing controls. See also section 125-170: Off-street parking and loading. 
(10)  Truck docks; loading and service areas. These facilities shall be located at the side of buildings or in the rear of the site and screened so as not to be visible from public streets. Where a building abuts residential buildings, the preferred location of these facilities shall be a side away from the residential buildings. 
(j)  Development regulations-Apartment buildings. The following regulations apply specifically to apartment buildings. 
(1)  Building form and appearance. Despite their greater height and bulk, apartment buildings shall complement the form and appearance of single-family homes and other neighboring buildings. 
(2)  Multiple entrances. Apartment buildings are encouraged to have multiple primary entrances for different groups of dwelling units. 
(3)  Blank walls. No unadorned blank walls greater than 15 feet in length, excluding garage doors, are permitted on the streetfront. Building surfaces over 24 feet in height or 50 feet in length shall include an offset, recess, or projection providing shadows or visual interest for at least 25 percent of the frontage. 
(4)  Location of driveways and parking. Vehicular access to apartment buildings shall be from a rear alley or a street driveway or garage entrance. If access is not provided from a rear service lane or alley, a sole vehicular access point shall provide entrance to all parking facilities and shall be as narrow as possible to accommodate necessary vehicular movement. Parked vehicles shall be screened so as not to be visible from public streets or private open space provided for apartment residents. Rear garages may be attached or unattached. 
(k)  Development regulations-Townhouse buildings. The following regulations apply specifically to townhouse buildings. 
(1)  Vehicular access and location of parking. The preferred vehicular access to townhouse buildings shall be from a rear service lane or alley. Rear garages may be attached or unattached. 
(l)  Development regulations-Duplex buildings. The following regulations apply specifically to duplex buildings. 
(1)  Building form. Duplex buildings shall be of a similar form and appearance to single-family homes; duplexes on single lots shall not be distinguishable from single-family homes except for the presence of an additional exterior entrance. 
(2)  Vehicular access and location of parking. The preferred vehicular access point is from a rear alley, although street access may be provided under certain conditions. If street access is provided, garages shall be located at the rear of the primary dwelling and may be either attached or unattached. If street access is provided, driveways shared by adjacent lots shall are encouraged. 
(m)  Development regulations-Single-family buildings. The following regulations apply specifically to single-family buildings. 
(1)  Vehicular access and location of parking. The preferred vehicular access point is from a rear alley, although street access may be provided under certain conditions. If street access is provided, garages shall be located at the rear of the primary dwelling and may be either attached or unattached. If street access is provided, driveways shared by adjacent lots shall are encouraged. If street access is provided, driveways shared by adjacent lots are encouraged. 
(n)  Development regulations-Public and semi-public buildings. The following regulations apply specifically to public and semi-public buildings. 
(1)  Location. Public and semi-public buildings shall be given prominent locations within the -TND Overlay District, such as at the termination of a major street, the intersection of major thoroughfares, or within or adjacent to a public open space. Buildings should be framed by or serve to frame an important view corridor. 
(2)  Building siting and form. Building siting and form, such as height, bulk, articulation, materials, etc., shall reinforce the importance of a public or semi-public building and distinguish it from private development. Unique set backs, greater heights, interesting forms, distinctive materials and/or design techniques shall serve to establish the visual identity of a public or semi-public building. Standards for public and semi-public buildings shall be established on a case-by-case basis in response to the building's purpose and surroundings within the master plan for the district. 
(o)  Open space and landscaping. Improved open space shall be provided for the benefit of residents and the surrounding community in an amount greater than ten percent of the total land area of the -TND Overlay District. A -NOS Neighborhood Open Space sub-district shall be established in the following manner: 
(1)  Public access and maintenances. Open space provided to satisfy the minimum ten percent open space requirement shall be open to the public. Such open space shall either be deeded to the City of League City or a perpetual easement shall be established to guarantee reasonable public access at a manner that does not differ from that provided to residents of the district. The applicant shall be responsible for providing all open space improvements listed within the master plan for the district and necessary to make the open space suitable for its intended public use. If title is transferred to the city, the city shall assume the maintenance of such lands and facilities. 
(2)  Consistency with city goals. Open space shall be provided in a manner consistent with the City of League City Parks Master Plan, comprehensive plan, and any subsequently adopted plans. 
(3)  Open space resource inventory. The master plan shall include an inventory of significant open space features on the site, including vegetation and animal communities, sensitive habitats, heritage trees, views, water features, geologic formations, soils, and other relevant attributes. The -NOS Neighborhood Open Space sub-district shall include as many existing open space features as possible. 
(4)  Role of open space. Open space shall be framed by development and shall interconnect buildings, streets, and sub-districts of the -TND Overlay District. Open space shall be provided in a manner that allows convenient non-automotive access by all residents and shall located throughout the -TND Overlay District as multiple open space features. Open space shall be designed to complement buildings and vice versa. 
(5)  Central open space feature. The -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district shall be anchored by a central open space feature of at least 1/4-acre. Development may be directly adjacent to the feature or may be separated by a street. The open space feature shall serve both as a public amenity as well as a means of attracting customers to surrounding buildings. This open space feature may take the form of a square, circle, green, commons, plaza, pedestrian mall, pedestrian boulevard, or other suitable urban open space feature. This open space feature may satisfy the requirement for -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district-bounded open space (refer to subsection (e)). 
(6)  Other potential open space features. The following open space features may be included within a -TND Overlay District to satisfy the open space requirements. 
a.  Squares, plazas, and commons. Formal central open space features that are primarily designed for passive recreation. Development shall front upon such features either directly or across a street. These features may include children's play facilities or small active recreational facilities, such as a basketball or volleyball court. 
b.  Tot lots and pocket parks. Small passive parks or children's play areas that are no larger than two average adjoining parcels and that are interspersed within residential areas to provide highly localized open space, allow through pedestrian access, and/or break up development monotony. 
c.  Small athletic fields. Small active recreation facilities designed to fit within the context of surrounding compact development, such as a single soccer field or a pair of basketball courts where required parking can be accommodated on an adjacent street frontage. Small athletic fields shall be located and designed to allow neighborhood children to safely travel to and from the field unaccompanied. 
d.  Greenways and parkways. Linear open space features which allow walking, running, and bicycling for both recreation and everyday transportation. Greenways are non-automotive while parkways allow for automotive travel. Development shall front onto greenways and parkways. Greenways shall only be counted toward the open space requirement if they have an average width of 50 feet and a minimum width of 20 feet. Parkways shall only be counted toward the open space requirement if they have an average width of 100 feet and a minimum width of 50 feet excluding automotive travel and parking lanes. 
e.  Natural preserves. Passive recreation areas for the preservation wildlife or agricultural resources. Trails and small interpretative display shall allow for public access and understanding; temporary or permanent access restrictions may be necessary to protect sensitive resources. 
(7)  Open space connectivity. Open Space features shall be connected, when feasible, with existing open space features outside of the -TND Overlay District as well as other newly created open space features within the district. Connections may be provided through greenways, paths, boulevards, etc. 
(8)  Streetscapes. Streets provide one of the largest forms of un-built space within a - TND Overlay District, and while not open space, streets shall be appropriately appointed so as to provide an attractive environment for pedestrians and drivers. The -TND Overlay District Master Plan shall designate guidelines for the following: 
a.  Street trees. Location, species, caliper size, planting boxes, spacing, etc. In general, street trees shall be provided on all streets and shall form a canopy over the street and sidewalk; no understory tree species shall be used. 
b.  Other planting areas. Location, species, etc. 
c.  Street lighting. Size, frequency, and type of luminaries. Guidelines shall ensure that street lighting is scaled and directed to both sidewalks as well as travel lanes. 
d.  Street amenities. Spaces, such as corners, bulb-outs, etc. and furniture, such as benches, refuse receptacles, newspaper boxes, etc. 
e.  Streets shall not be used to satisfy the open space requirement. 
(p)  Circulation. A -TND Overlay District shall provide a range of circulation options for residents and visitors and establish the circulation system as a key part of a district's public realm. In order to promote a circulation system consistent with the district's built form, the following regulations apply. 
(1)  Arterial roads. A -TND Overlay District shall not be bisected by a major arterial road. 
(2)  Gates and entry signage. All streets within a -TND Overlay District shall be dedicated to the City of League City. No gates, guard houses, or other obstructions shall be used to restrict public access to a -TND Overlay District. While temporary signage at the entries to a -TND Overlay District are permitted during the initial sale of properties, no signs, except as permitted below, shall permanently mark the entrance to a -TND Overlay District. Public art, special roadway features, or entry monuments may be used to visually define the entrance to a -TND Overlay District provided they are scaled and oriented to both pedestrians and automobile drivers; all text on monuments at a given entry shall cover an area of less than four square feet. 
(3)  Street connectivity. The circulation system within a -TND Overlay District shall be highly interconnected to ease non-automotive travel, efficiently distribute traffic throughout the district, and improve the efficiency of public services, such as emergency response, solid waste collection, and utilities. The traditional orthogonal street grid of early American cities exemplifies such a system, although streets within a -TND Overlay District need not be either straight or meet at right angles. Additionally: 
a.  A -TND Overlay District shall meet a minimum connectivity ratio of at least 1.5 street links: One street node (refer to figure 125-83.O). A street node is the intersection of three or more street links (excepting cul-de-sacs), where street links are segments of street extending from such an intersection and terminating at the next node (excepting at arterials). Intersections with arterials and links extending out from such intersections beyond a -TND Overlay District shall not be counted. Stub streets shall only be counted as segments if four or more parcels directly front upon the stub street. Cul-de-sacs shall be counted as links and their termini shall be counted as nodes. Rear service lanes and alleys shall neither be considered street links nor be used to constitute a node. 
b.  The circulation system of a -TND Overlay District shall not only connect internally but also with surrounding development. Where abutting existing development, the street system shall be integrated with the existing street pattern at all possible current or future connection points. Where immediately abutting undeveloped land that has the potential to be developed, the district street system shall provide potential connection points, such as publicly dedicated lots or stub streets, so that future development can connect to the district at the same degree that streets within the district are connected. Connections to arterial roads adjacent to the development shall be provided so that no such connection is farther than 1,250 feet from another such connection. 
c.  Street alignments shall serve to create and terminate views, give prominence to important buildings and places, and control traffic speeds. Cul-de-sacs and other dead-end streets shall not be permitted unless required because of topography or natural resources as determined by the city; if permitted, such streets shall be no longer than 200 feet and shall allow, if feasible, the through travel of non-motorized modes. 
(4)  Block length. Blocks within a -TND Overlay District shall be scaled to the pedestrian and facilitate street connectivity. No block face shall be longer than 650 feet. A block face shall be measured as the length of the boundary between the public right-of-way and subdivided parcels from a point closest to the center of an intersection to the point closest to the center of the next closest intersection (refer to Figure 125-83.O). Rear alleys shall not be considered when calculating block lengths. A mid-block alley or pedestrian right-of-way is required on any block longer than 500 feet. 
(5)  Rear alleys. Rear alleys shall be the preferred means for providing vehicular access to properties within a -TND Overlay District; the master plan for the district shall include all alleys within its circulation diagram. 
(6)  Street standards. Street standards and designs within a -TND Overlay District shall reflect slower design speeds, on-street parking, and the presence of pedestrians and bicyclists. The city engineer may approve context-sensitive street widths, lane widths, and turning radii that are smaller than otherwise permitted within the city. Context-sensitive street designs shall be consistent with current professional understanding of traffic engineering best practices for neo-traditional urban development; for example, refer to the Institute of Transportation Engineers "Traditional Neighborhood Street Design" (1999), or the City of Austin, TX, "Traditional Neighborhood District Criteria Manual" (1997). Approved street designs shall permit adequate police, fire, and other emergency response; emergency access on narrow streets and turning radii may be provided limiting on-street parking at intersections or appropriate other means. Reduced street widths shall serve to discourage non-local through-traffic while reducing applicant costs and water quality issues associated with higher street connectivity. 
(7)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of all streets within a -TND Overlay District, except on parkways. Sidewalks shall be at least six feet wide and shall include a planting strip in the -NR Neighborhood Residential sub-district or a planting zone within the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district of at least three feet between the sidewalk and street curb to accommodate required street trees. Street furniture are permitted within the planting strip or zone. 
(8)  Public right-of-ways. The minimum public right-of-way for a given street shall be the sum of the widths of vehicular travel lanes, parking lanes, sidewalks, planting strips and any utilities necessary to adequately serve a particular street and the surrounding development; the minimum right-of-way requirements of the subdivision ordinance shall not apply. 
(9)  Traffic calming. Traffic calming measures, such as bulb-outs, neck-downs, chicanes, deflectors, traffic humps, raised crosswalks, special paving, medians, roundabouts and traffic circles shall be encouraged as appropriate within a -TND Overlay District provided they are approved by the city engineer. Traffic calming measures shall be used to reduce non-local through-traffic on the interconnected street system. 
(10)  Bicycle travel. A circulation system for bicycle travel shall be provided throughout the -TND Overlay District; the system may include dedicated or shared bicycle paths, on-street bicycle lanes, or bicycle routes marked through signage or pavement markings. Within the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district, adequate on-street bicycle parking shall be provided. 
(11)  On-street parking. On-street parking shall be provided on all streets within a -TND Overlay District. Within the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district, on-street parking shall be provided on both sides of a street and individual stalls shall be marked. Within the -NR Neighborhood Residential sub-district, on-street parking shall be provided on at least one side of a street. Street tree boxes, bulb-outs, and other traffic calming encroachments are permitted within the parking lane. 
(12)  Parking plan. The master plan for the district shall identify how required parking shall be provided within the -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district through an included parking plan. Parking lots shall be encouraged to be shared by adjacent properties or throughout the entire -NC Neighborhood Center sub-district. Shared off-site lots or parking structures, which may be privately or publicly owned, shall be located behind buildings, on side-streets or alleys, or in the middle of a block. Shared off-site lots shall not be adjacent to the central open space feature. On-street parking spaces directly and entirely in front of a property may be counted toward satisfying its off-street parking requirement. Individual parking lots for individual businesses shall be discouraged. The city engineer may reduce minimum parking requirements established elsewhere in this ordinance based upon the efficiencies gained through shared parking arrangements and higher rates of non-automotive travel within a -TND Overlay District. In no case shall there be more than 120 percent of the required parking spaces within a -TND Overlay District. 
(13)  Truck routes. Truck routes be designated and marked to minimize truck travel through the -NR Neighborhood Residential sub-district. 
(q)  Procedures for -TND Overlay District application. In addition to the procedures for an application for a zoning map amendment under section 125-49, an application for rezoning to a -TND Overlay District shall be processed in the following manner. 
(1)  Pre-application conference. Prior to submitting an application for a Traditional Neighborhood Development, the prospective applicant shall request a review by the city planner or designee and representatives from other city departments, as appropriate, to discuss the prospective development with respect to compatibility with existing and anticipated land uses in the vicinity and the city's adopted planning rationale. The pre-application conference is intended to guide the prospective applicant in the preparation of a concept plan to be submitted for planning and zoning commission consideration and city council approval. There is no fee associated with a request for a pre-application conference; however, additional requests for a pre-application conference for the same site within a period of one-year from the date of the initial conference may incur a fee associated with any city costs to do so. 
(2)  Submission and approval of concept plan. The applicant shall submit a concept plan (bubble plan) as part of the application for rezoning to a -TND Overlay District, the required contents of which are noted in subsection P below. The city planner or designee shall prepare a written report on the concept plan that will summarize the anticipated impacts of the proposed development on planning goals, utilities, emergency services, vehicular traffic, taxes, and properties within a 200-foot distance of the site for which the development is proposed. The concept plan and report by the city planner or designee shall be submitted for consideration by the planning and zoning commission and recommendation to city council. Upon approval of the concept plan by city council, the applicant may proceed with the preparation of a master plan, the required contents of which are noted in bsection R. below, and proceed to subsequent steps for approval with reasonable assurance that if the agreed upon concept is carried forth, then preliminary and final plat approvals will be granted by the city. 
(3)  Approval of master plan. After city council has approved the -TND Overlay District, then the applicant shall submit a master plan for consideration and approval by the planning and zoning commission. The applicant may proceed with platting after approval of the master plan. The master plan must not have more than a 15 percent change in the land use or a significant change in geographic location from the previously approved concept plan for the -TND Overlay District. Changes that alter the uses permitted by more than 15 percent and/or have a significant change in geographic location shall require submittal of a revised concept plan to be considered and approved by the commission and city council via a public hearing and notified in the same manner as a text or map amendment. When determining whether or not a "TND" development has exceeded 15 percent and should be considered by the commission and city council, each of the following shall be considered: 
a.  The total acreage change in the "TND" development based on the original concept plan document. The concept plan establishes the land use acreages, and represents the baseline in determining the percentage of change. (Example: In a 100-acre "TND", an increase of ten acres of residential and a decrease of ten acres of commercial is still a total change of ten acres and the percentage of change of the total acreage is ten percent.) 
b.  Percentage of change (increased or decreased) within each land use category based on the original concept plan document. For residential uses, the density units per acre shall also be calculated. (Example: In a 100-acre "TND", a decrease from 15 to ten acres in the residential land use category represents a five percent change in acreage. However, an increase in density units per acre (dua) from 100 dua to 150 dua represents a 50 percent density increase.) 
c.  Intangibles such as re-locating a thoroughfare shown on the transportation plan, changing the general concept or changing the location of uses that may not necessarily have anything to do with the acreage of land uses per se, but may be just as important in evaluating whether or not a "TND" should be reconsidered by the commission and city council. 
(4)  Lapse of approval and renewal of master plan. A master plan shall be effective on the date the ordinance creating the -TND Overlay District is approved and shall expire after two years unless a building permit has been issued and a vested right established. An approved master plan may specify a development staging program exceeding two years. The planning and zoning commission may recommend, and the city council may renew, a mater plan for a period of up to two years if it finds the renewal consistent with the purposes of this section. Application for renewal shall be made in writing to the city planner or designee not less than 30 days or more than 120 days prior to expiration. 
(5)  Revisions to master plan. Changes to the master plan that do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property; do not alter the uses permitted or increase the density, building height or coverage of the site; do not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site; and do not significantly alter the landscape plans or signage as indicated on the approved development may be recommended by the city planner or designee and approved by the planning and zoning commission. The master plan must not have more than a 15 percent change in the land use or a significant change in geographic location from the previously approved concept plan for the -TND Overlay District. Changes that alter the uses permitted by more than 15 percent and/or have a significant change in geographic location shall require submittal of a revised concept plan to be considered and approved by the commission and city council via a public hearing and notified in the same manner as a text or map amendment. When determining whether or not a "TND" development has exceeded 15 percent and should be considered by city council, each of the following shall be considered: 
a.  The total acreage change in the "TND" development based on the original concept plan document. The concept plan establishes the land use acreages, and represents the baseline in determining the percentage of change. (Example: In a 100-acre "TND", an increase of ten acres of residential and a decrease of ten acres of commercial is still a total change of ten acres and the percentage of change of the total acreage is ten percent.) 
b.  Percentage of change (increased or decreased) within each land use category based on the original concept plan document. For residential uses, the density units per acre shall also be calculated. (Example: In a 100-acre "TND", a decrease from 15 to ten acres in the residential land use category represents a five percent change in acreage. However, an increase in density units per acre (dua) from 100 dua to 150 dua represents a 50 percent density increase.) 
c.  Intangibles such as re-locating a thoroughfare shown on the transportation plan, changing the general concept or changing the location of uses that may not necessarily have anything to do with the acreage of land uses per se, but may be just as important in evaluating whether or not a "TND" should be reconsidered by the commission and city council. 
(r)  Required plans and materials. An application for rezoning to a -TND Overlay District requires the approval of a concept plan by city council and approval of a master plan by the planning and zoning commission. This section outlines the information required for each plan. 
(1)  Concept plan. The concept plan shall include the following information: 
a.  A site inventory analysis showing existing vegetation, natural watercourses or standing water, flood-prone areas, and any other known hazard areas. This analysis shall include graphic and textural materials indicating how the proposed development will affect such natural features and identify what, if any, trees intended for removal. 
b.  An accurate survey of the subject property showing the existing topographical contour intervals of not more than five feet, and a plan showing the proposed topography at minimum five-foot contour intervals and significant change in drainage. 
c.  A summary of the proposed development program, including: detailed tabulation showing the proposed acreage of each land use; the approximate size and number of residential units; the approximate square footage of nonresidential buildings; description of the open space program, including the location and function of developed and/or improved open space, its relationship to any natural or historic values on the site, and its status as either public or private open space. 
d.  The location of -TND Overlay District sub-districts, land uses, and building types. 
e.  Analysis showing compliance with sub-district, land use, and building minimum provision requirements. 
f.  A scale drawing showing the proposed street and circulation system design, including a layout diagram, street changes (including the location and width of all curb cuts), width of travel lanes, landscaping, and pedestrian amenities; building sites or lots; areas reserved for use as parks, playgrounds, utility easements, and school sites; lands to be dedicated to the city; general location and description of existing and proposed utility services (including size of water and wastewater mains); and the existing zoning classification of all abutting properties. 
g.  A determination that adequate public facilities exist to service the proposed development (road, sewerage, water, fire-suppression, and storm drainage) as defined by the city's adequate public facilities ordinance. 
h.  An estimate of the projected population within the -TND Overlay District to assist the city and the applicable school district(s) in determining future needs. 
i.  A summary of requested variance(s) from any provision in the League City Code of Ordinances. 
j.  A development schedule indicating the rate of anticipated development to completion from the date on which construction begins. As part of the -TND plan, the development schedule shall be adhered to by the owner, applicant, and any successor in interest. 
k.  Perspective illustrations, either hand drawn or computer generated, indicating the general form and character of development, including representative examples of residential and nonresidential buildings. 
(2)  Master plan. In addition to presenting in final form the various elements required in the concept plan above, the master plan shall include the following information: 
a.  A description of proposed governance institute or institutions, such as homeowners associations, and initial governance documents, if applicable. 
b.  A plot plan showing adherence to the buffer yards requirements (refer to subsection 125-190.C.) 
c.  A depiction of existing surface drainage patterns and proposed retention and detention areas is required. 
(s)  Review of plans. All development is subject to development review in accordance with the city's applications and procedures, pursuant to article II, division 2: Applications and procedures, and shall be in accordance with the adopted master plan for the area. 
(Ord. No. 2005-24, 8-30-2005; Ord. No. 2007-34, § 2, 7-24-2007; Ord. No. 2011-40, § 2(Exh. A), 8-9-2011; Ord. No. 2015-08, § 2(Exh. A), 3-24-2015) 
Sec. 125-84. - -MAC Major Activity Center Overlay District. 
(a)  Purposes. The specific purposes of the -MAC Major Activity Center Overlay District are to: 
 Encourage the development of major activity centers in new areas of the city as prescribed in the comprehensive plan that provide opportunities for shopping, employment, and entertainment for residents of both the city and region; 
 Ensure that major activity centers are convenient and beneficial to city residents and are designed to accommodate both auto- and pedestrian-orientation in their location, access, layout, scale, and design; 
 Provide for a range of commercial, public and semi-public, and residential uses and activities that encourage interest, vitality, and social interaction in the area and create a sense of place; and 
 Provide for circulation systems and streetscapes that are safe, efficient, and pleasant for pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and automobile drivers. 
Three sub-districts are established under the -MAC Overlay District. The additional purposes of each sub-district are: 
  Mixed Format Retail (MFR). This sub-district provides opportunities for an active mix of retail-oriented uses in a "Main Street" format that balances vehicular and pedestrian access. Development in the sub-district will result in a pedestrian-friendly environment in terms of building orientation and scale, pedestrian circulation, and outdoor amenity. A range of building sizes are encouraged in this sub-district with floorplates generally ranging between 1,500 and 25,000 square feet so as to accommodate a variety of retail uses, such as deli/coffee, gifts, books/news, music/video, restaurant, clothing/linens, housewares/furniture, electronics, and hardware. Offices and related business services may also be accommodated on upper floors and will generally take the form of small-scale professional practices, such as medical and legal offices, although larger-scale office developments are possible provided they contain pedestrian-oriented retail uses on the ground floor. Residential uses on upper floors may also be permitted. 
Buildings in this sub-district must establish a well-defined street wall through the consistent placement of retail storefronts and will be at least two stories tall. Careful articulation of the buildings and storefronts should be used in conjunction with wide sidewalks to create interesting, pedestrian-scaled outdoor spaces that provide opportunities for seating areas, water features, sculpture, as well as protection from the elements. Such outdoor spaces may be provided where there is a small break in the storefronts. Such breaks in the storefront should be used as paseos or mid-block connections via paths, ramps or stairs to rear parking areas. With the exception of on-street parking, parking must be located behind the buildings. Landscaping, lighting, and signage should be subdued and present a unified appearance and theme. It is important that development in this sub-district provide connections to neighboring sub-districts to allow easy pedestrian movement within the -MAC Overlay District. 
  Large Format Retail (LFR). This sub-district is intended to accommodate retail land uses requiring larger floorplates-generally in excess of 25,000 square feet and up to 150,000 square feet. Accessory uses are also permitted, including garden centers, tire centers, deli/coffee, and ATM. This sub-district encourages the creation of a unique and integrated form of large format retail development by requiring buildings to establish a consistent street wall that includes pedestrian amenities and provides opportunities for shoppers to walk from store to store along the sidewalk. Building facades must meet requirements for transparency and articulation and should create opportunities for outdoor spaces for seating and other amenities. Mid-block connections to parking areas are encouraged. 
Development in this sub-district is intended to complement development in neighboring sub-districts and will incorporate many design elements from the smaller-scaled -MFR Mixed Format Retail sub-district as a means of establishing an attractive and comfortable public realm-with respect to building orientation and scale, access, and outdoor amenity-and reducing the dominance of the auto on the built form. Landscaping, lighting, and signage should present a unified appearance and theme and help create a sense of place. Buildings will typically be one or two stories in height, although three-story buildings are permitted. It is important that development in this sub-district provide connections to neighboring sub-districts to allow easy pedestrian movement within the -MAC Overlay District. 
  Office/Institutional (OI). This sub-district provides for the development of single-use, large floorplate office and institutional buildings. It differs in scale and concentration from the office use allowable in the -MFR Mixed Format Retail sub-district, where office must be located above ground-floor retail and is one of many uses within a single building. This sub-district encourages both traditional office uses and complementary office-related uses, such as research and development, business services, and educational uses. A range of accessory uses are also permitted, such as a dry cleaner, snack bar, or daycare. Development in this sub-district will be of high-quality design that contributes to community character while enhancing employment opportunities for residents of the city. 
As in the -LFR Large Format Retail sub-district, development in the -OI Office/Institutional sub-district will complement the pedestrian orientation of neighboring development. Building frontages will be oriented toward internal streets to encourage pedestrian activity. Building walls on these streets must meet requirements for transparency and building articulation should create opportunities for outdoor spaces for seating and other amenities. Landscaping, lighting, and signage should present a unified appearance and theme and help create a sense of place. Structured parking is encouraged where possible to serve a multi-building complex. 
(b)  Zoning map designator. A -MAC Overlay District will be combined with the base zoning district(s) applied to the area and will be shown on the zoning map by a -MAC designator applied to the base district(s) designation. 
(c)  Applicability. A -MAC Major Activity Center Overlay District may be applied as an alternative to the - PUD Planned Unit Development Overlay District in any undeveloped area that is greater than 40 acres in size. In the case of a conflict between the provisions of an underlying base zoning district and the -MAC Overlay District, the provisions of the -MAC Overlay District shall govern. 
(d)  Land use regulations. Schedule 125-84.D. below prescribes the land use regulations for the -MAC Major Activity Center Overlay District by sub-district. The regulations for each sub-district are established by letter designations as follows: 
"P" designates permitted use classifications. 
"L" designates use classifications that are permitted, subject to certain limitations prescribed by the additional use regulations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. Number designations refer to the specific limitations listed at the end of Schedule 125-84.D. 
"S" designates use classifications permitted after review and approval of a special use permit by the city council. These uses are also subject to certain limitations in article IV, division 1: Standards for specific uses. 
Use classifications are defined in article V, division 1: Use classifications. In cases where a specific land use or activity is not defined, the city planner or designee shall assign the land use or activity to a classification that is substantially similar in character.

(1)  Maximum lot coverage. Includes buildings, parking areas, and driveways and maneuvering areas, but excludes common open space amenities and landscaped areas. 
(2)  Blank walls. No blank walls greater than 15 feet in length, excluding garage doors, shall be permitted on the primary street frontage. Building surfaces shall include an offset, recess, or projection providing shadows or visual interest for at least 25 percent of the frontage. 
(3)  Storefront continuity. Ground floor of retail buildings shall have a storefront appearance along the primary street frontage. This requirement may be reduced to 50 percent to accommodate non-retail frontage occupied by entertainment or outdoor eating areas. 
(4)  Building transparency. Ground floor of buildings shall have views into occupied space provided by windows, displays, or doors along the primary street frontage. This requirement may be reduced to 50 percent to accommodate non-retail frontage occupied by entertainment or outdoor eating areas. 
(5)  Minimum build-to lines. Ground floor of buildings shall be built to the sidewalk along the primary street frontage. 
(6)  Location of parking and loading. Parking shall be located behind or at the side of buildings, except for passenger drop-off areas which may be located at the building entry. Loading areas shall be screened so as not to be visible from public streets. Where the building abuts a residential district, the preferred location of loading facilities shall be the side away from the residential district boundary. 
(7)  Landscape setback. A minimum ten-foot-wide landscaped area shall be located between all portions of the parking lot and the street and shall contain the following: 
a.  One shade tree for every 30 feet of linear street frontage, excluding driveways. Trees may be planted in clusters or spaced linearly rather than being on 30-foot centers. The minimum size of the tree should be one and one-half-inch caliper (15 gallons) upon installation. 
b.  A continuous hedge consisting of shrubs that are not less than three feet or more than four feet in height and planted in three- or five-gallon container stocks upon installation. The landscape hedge shall be set back a minimum of three feet and a maximum of six feet from the perimeter of any parking space, driveway, or any access aisle. 
c.  In lieu of a landscape hedge, a berm measuring not less than three feet or more than four feet in height from finish grade of the parking lot may be utilized. The berm shall be set back a minimum of three feet and a maximum of six feet from the perimeter of any parking space, driveway, or any access aisle. The maximum slope shall not exceed 4:1. 
(g)  Procedures for -MAC Overlay District application. In addition to the procedures for an application for a zoning map amendment under section 125-49, an application for rezoning to a -MAC Overlay District shall be processed in the following manner. 
(1)  Pre-application conference. Prior to submitting an application for a major activity center development, the prospective applicant shall request a review by the city planner or designee and representatives from other city departments, as appropriate, to discuss the prospective development with respect to compatibility with existing and anticipated land uses in the vicinity and the city's adopted planning rationale. The pre-application conference is intended to guide the prospective applicant in the preparation of a concept plan to be submitted for planning and zoning commission consideration and city council approval. There is no fee associated with a request for a pre-application conference; however, additional requests for a pre-application conference for the same site within a period of one-year from the date of the initial conference may incur a fee associated with any city costs to do so. 
(2)  Submission and approval of concept plan. The applicant shall submit a concept plan (bubble plan) as part of the application for rezoning to a -MAC Overlay District, the required contents of which are noted in subsection (h) below. The city planner or designee shall prepare a written report on the concept plan that will summarize the anticipated impacts of the proposed development on planning goals, utilities, emergency services, vehicular traffic, taxes, and properties within a 200-foot distance of the site for which the development is proposed. The concept plan and report by the city planner or designee shall be submitted for consideration by the planning and zoning commission and recommendation to city council. Upon approval of the concept plan by city council, the applicant may proceed with the preparation of a master plan, the required contents of which are noted in subsection (h) below, and proceed to subsequent steps for approval with reasonable assurance that if the agreed upon concept is carried forth, then preliminary and final plat approvals will be granted by the city. 
(3)  Approval of master plan. After city council has approved the -MAC Overlay District, then the applicant shall submit a master plan for consideration and approval by the planning and zoning commission. The applicant may proceed with platting after approval of the master plan. The master plan must not have more than a 15 percent change in the land use or a significant change in geographic location from the previously approved concept plan for the -MAC Overlay District. Changes that alter the uses permitted by more than 15 percent and/or have a significant change in geographic location shall require submittal of a revised concept plan to be considered and approved by the commission and city council via a public hearing and notified in the same manner as a text or map amendment. When determining whether or not a -MAC development has exceeded 15 percent and should be considered by city council, each of the following shall be considered: 
a.  The total acreage change in the -MAC development based on the original concept plan document. The concept plan establishes the land use acreages, and represents the baseline in determining the percentage of change. (Example: In a 100-acre "MAC", an increase of ten acres of residential and a decrease of ten acres of commercial is still a total change of ten acres and the percentage of change of the total acreage is ten percent.) 
b.  Percentage of change (increased or decreased) within each land use category based on the original concept plan document. For residential uses, the density units per acre shall also be calculated. (Example: In a 100-acre -MAC, a decrease from 15 to ten acres in the residential land use category represents a five percent change in acreage. However, an increase in density units per acre (dua) from 100 dua to 150 dua represents a 50 percent density increase.) 
c.  Intangibles such as re-locating a thoroughfare shown on the transportation plan, changing the general concept or changing the location of uses that may not necessarily have anything to do with the acreage of land uses per se, but may be just as important in evaluating whether or not a -MAC should be reconsidered by the commission and city council. 
(4)  Lapse of approval and renewal of master plan. A master plan shall be effective on the date the ordinance creating the -MAC Overlay District is approved and shall expire after two years unless a building permit has been issued and a vested right established. An approved master plan may specify a development staging program exceeding two years. The planning and zoning commission may recommend, and the city council may renew, a master plan for a period of up to two years if it finds the renewal consistent with the purposes of this section. Application for renewal shall be made in writing to the city planner or designee not less than 30 days or more than 120 days prior to expiration. 
(5)  Revisions to master plan. Changes to the master plan that do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property; do not alter the uses permitted or increase the density, building height or coverage of the site; do not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site; and do not significantly alter the landscape plans or signage as indicated on the approved development may be authorized by the city planner or designee. Changes that alter the uses permitted by more than 15 percent and/or have a significant change in geographic location shall require submittal of a revised concept plan to be considered and approved by the commission and city council via a public hearing and notified in the same manner as a text or map amendment. When determining whether or not a -MAC development has exceeded 15 percent and should be considered by the commission and city council, each of the following shall be considered: 
a.  The total acreage change in the -MAC development based on the original concept plan document. The concept plan establishes the land use acreages, and represents the baseline in determining the percentage of change. (Example: In a 100-acre "MAC", an increase of ten acres of residential and a decrease of ten acres of commercial is still a total change of ten acres and the percentage of change of the total acreage is ten percent.) 
b.  Percentage of change (increased or decreased) within each land use category based on the original concept plan document. For residential uses, the density units per acre shall also be calculated. (Example: In a 100-acre -MAC, a decrease from 15 to ten acres in the residential land use category represents a five percent change in acreage. However, an increase in density units per acre (dua) from 100 dua to 150 dua represents a 50 percent density increase.) 
c.  Intangibles such as re-locating a thoroughfare shown on the transportation plan, changing the general concept or changing the location of uses that may not necessarily have anything to do with the acreage of land uses per se, but may be just as important in evaluating whether or not a -MAC should be reconsidered by the commission and city council. 
(h)  Required plans and materials. An application for rezoning to a -MAC Overlay District requires the approval of a concept plan by city council and approval of a master plan by the planning and zoning commission. This section outlines the information required for each plan. 
(1)  Concept plan. The concept plan shall include the following information: 
a.  A site inventory analysis showing existing vegetation, natural watercourses or standing water, flood-prone areas, and any other known hazard areas. This analysis shall include graphic and textural materials indicating how the proposed development will affect such natural features and identify what, if any, trees intended for removal. 
b.  An accurate survey of the subject property showing the existing topographical contour intervals of not more than five feet, and a plan showing the proposed topography at minimum five-foot contour intervals and significant change in drainage. 
c.

f.  A determination that adequate public facilities exist to service the proposed development (road, sewerage, water, fire suppression, and storm drainage) as defined by the city's adequate public facilities ordinance. 
g.  An estimate of the projected population within the -MAC Overlay District to assist the city and the applicable school district(s) in determining future needs. 
h.  A summary of requested variance(s) from any provision in the League City Code of Ordinances. 
i.  A development schedule indicating the rate of anticipated development to completion from the date on which construction begins. As part of the PUD plan, the development schedule shall be adhered to by the owner, applicant, and any successor in interest. 
j.  Perspective illustrations, either hand drawn or computer generated, indicating the general form and character of development, including representative examples of residential and nonresidential buildings. 
(2)  Master plan. In addition to presenting the final form of the various elements required in the concept plan above, the master plan shall include the following information: 
a.  A description of proposed governance institute or institutions, such as homeowners associations, and initial governance documents, if applicable. 
b.  A plot plan showing adherence to the buffer yards requirements (refer to subsection 125-190.C.) 
c.  A depiction of existing surface drainage patterns and proposed retention and detention areas is required.

DIVISION 5. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

Sec. 125-170. - Off-street parking and loading. 
(a)  Purposes. This section combines the city's existing site off-street parking and loading requirements and development standards and includes an updated use list to match the use classification scheme. New standards are included for screening, landscaping, lighting, and bicycle parking. The purposes of the off-street parking and loading regulations are to: 
(1)  Ensure that adequate but not excessive parking is provided for new land uses and major alterations to existing uses to meet the parking needs created by such uses. 
(2)  Establish regulations for new uses, new or relocated buildings and buildings that have been altered or expanded. 
(3)  Ensure that off-street parking and loading areas are designed and located to protect the public safety, minimize congestion, reduce solar heat gain, minimize traffic conflicts and congestion on parking aisles and public streets, and buffer surrounding land uses and public areas from visual and noise impacts. 
(4)  Ensure pedestrian-friendly parking areas by providing for safe pedestrian routes, parking lot lighting, parking spaces sized for contemporary vehicles, and trees for shade. 
(5)  Provide for the accessibility needs and requirements of disabled and elderly persons. 
(b)  Applicability. These regulations shall apply to new uses and to alterations and additions to nonconforming structures. No building permit shall be issued for a use unless the use complies with this section. 
(c)  General provisions. 
(1)  Required parking. All required parking shall be provided on site, except as provided in subsection (7) below. The number of parking spaces required for individual uses in this zoning ordinance is set forth in subsection (d) below. 
(2)  Required parking and parking lot landscaping for structures that are altered. The parking and parking lot landscaping requirements of this section shall apply to the new portion of the parking lot when an existing structure is altered. 
(3)  Uses not mentioned. Parking requirements for a use not identified in this section shall be determined by the city planner or designee based on parking requirements for the most similar use listed in division 1 or article V of this zoning ordinance. The city planner or designee may require submission of a parking study prepared by a person licensed to prepare such study. 
(4)  Fractional spaces. If the number of parking spaces required in this section results in a fraction, then the required number shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, if the computed requirement equals 9.5 spaces, then ten spaces are required. If the computed requirement equals 9.4 spaces, then nine spaces are required. 
(5)  Computation of required parking for residential use. Residential parking for multi-family uses shall be based on the number of bedrooms. Any rooms defined as bedrooms by the city building code shall be counted as a bedroom for the purpose of determining off-street parking requirements. 
(6)  Visitor parking. On-street parking may be counted toward the visitor-parking requirement for developments in all residential district, provided that the street has a minimum eight-foot wide legal parking area exclusive of travel lanes. To qualify as one visitor parking space, there shall be an uninterrupted 20-foot long space and a sidewalk adjacent to the parking side of the street. The city may require on-street visitor parking spaces to be striped. 
(7)  Shared parking. Where a use generates parking demand primarily during hours when an adjacent use or uses are not in operation or generate shared trips, a reduction of up to 50 percent of the required parking may be approved by means of a special use permit. The special use permit shall terminate if the use changes. The application shall include: 
a.  Submission of a parking study prepared by a person licensed to prepare such study; 
b.  Proposed documents for recordation of cross-easements for parking purposes satisfactory to the city attorney; and 
c.  Proposed documents satisfactory to the city attorney to ensure maintenance of the shared parking spaces. 
(8)  Temporary use of parking area. The temporary use of parking areas for uses other than parking is permitted provided that: 
a.  The non-parking use complies with all temporary use and license requirements; 
b.  The use does not interfere with fire or emergency vehicle access; 
c.  The use does not create a traffic hazard or interfere with vehicular or pedestrian circulation on the site; 
d.  The use provides accessible parking in accordance with applicable laws; and 
e.  The non-parking use is conducted with written property owner authorization. 
(9)  Parking for age restricted uses or to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. A reduction in parking requirements for a multi-family age-restricted use may be approved by an special use permit where the project is restricted by covenant or deed restriction to an age-restricted use. Any such approval shall be based on a parking study or other acceptable evidence that supports the requested parking reduction. In no event shall required parking be reduced below 0.5 parking spaces per dwelling unit. Parking requirements for the multi-family use shall revert to those specified in this section if age restrictions are no longer in effect. 
(10)  Restrictions on parking in commercial and office districts. Recreational vehicles, trailers, commercial vehicles, or combinations of vehicles exceeding 21 feet in length shall not be parked within any commercial zoned property, except for the purpose of loading, unloading, service, or patronizing a commercial use on the site. In commercial districts, no vehicle shall be parked overnight and used for permanent or temporary habitation. 
(11)  Prohibited parking. Parking shall be prohibited in the following locations: 
a.  Fire lanes; 
b.  Required landscape areas; 
c.  Unimproved properties or portions of properties in nonresidential and multi-family districts; and 
d.  Outside areas not designated for parking on an approved site plan. 
(12)  Separation from buildings. Parking spaces shall be separated from a multi-family residential building or non-residential building by: 
a.  A raised walkway of at least four feet in width exclusive of any overhang permitted in subsection (18) below and in compliance with minimum ADA requirements, or; 
b.  A raised landscape planter of at least five feet in width exclusive of any overhang permitted in subsection (18) below. 
(13)  Parking overhang. Vehicles may overhang landscape areas or sidewalks by 24 inches provided that: 
a.  The overhang does not interfere with the base of any structure, raised planter, seating bench, fence, utility equipment, light pole or base, or trunk of any tree; 
b.  The unobstructed width of the sidewalk, exclusive of the 24 inch overhang, is not less than four feet; 
c.  The allowable overhang does not reduce any landscape planter width below five feet; and 
d.  No part of any parked vehicle extends into any required landscape area or beyond any property line. 
(14)  Opposing overhangs. Where parking spaces are on opposite sides of the landscaping or sidewalk or combination thereof, the landscape area or sidewalk shall be at least nine feet in width. 
(15)  Parking wheel stops. Concrete or metal parking wheel stops held in place by steel posts or placed directly on the parking surface are prohibited. 
(16)  Side clearance. Each parking space located at the end of a row of spaces shall provide a three-foot wide area clear of vertical obstructions more than six inches in height, exclusive of landscaping, next to the side of the space. 
(17)  Tandem parking, non-residential. Tandem parking spaces shall only be approved for full-time valet or attended parking. Tandem parking spaces may be used to satisfy a portion of the parking requirement for non-residential uses, subject to the approval of an special use permit. The special use permit shall terminate if the use changes. 
(18)  Striping. One or more four-inch wide lines of white or other contrasting color paint shall delineate all multi-family residential and non-residential parking spaces. Such lines shall be maintained to clearly identify each space. 
(19)  Pavement edge protection. All permanent uses other than single family residential lots shall provide a six-inch, poured-in-place concrete curb or other approved material for all parking areas and drive aisles abutting landscaped areas. 
(20)  Parking on single-family residential lots. One additional uncovered parking space may be constructed next to the driveway or adjacent to a garage or carport. On corner lots, the parking space shall not be constructed in the street side setback area. No vehicle or trailer shall be parked in the front or side yard setback area visible from the street, except on a driveway or additional parking space permitted in this subsection. The additional parking space permitted by this subsection shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  The parking space shall have a surface of asphalt, concrete, decomposed granite or gravel; 
b.  The surface may consist of two parallel concrete or cement strips. The area between such parallel strips shall be landscaped with vegetative or non-vegetative ground cover; 
c.  No parked vehicle may obstruct or encroach on a sidewalk; and 
d.  Access to the parking space shall be via a curb cut, rolled curb, or driveway.

ARTICLE V. - MISCELLANEOUS 
DIVISION 1. - USE CLASSIFICATIONS 

Sec. 125-260. - Use classifications. 
(a)  Purposes. The existing zoning ordinance does not define specific uses and thereby fails to clearly establish the city's intent for each specific use. This section rectifies this omission by clearly defining the specific uses referenced in earlier chapters. These definitions will assist the city planner or designee, the zoning board of adjustment, and the city council interpret, apply, and enforce use regulations. 
    A new expanded and inclusive use classification system is used here to regulate land uses. This system also integrates, where appropriate, use categories from the new North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). These categories are based on the types of production activities performed, and are intended to define and classify newer land uses and reflect recent planning trends. 
    Use classifications describe one or more uses of land having similar characteristics, but do not list every use or activity that may appropriately be within the classification. Article III of this chapter relies on these defined use classifications and specify in separate schedules the land uses permitted, uses subject to specific limitations, and uses requiring approval of a special use permit. 
(b)  Uses not classified. If an application is submitted for a use type that is not listed in any use table, the city planner or designee shall be authorized to make a similar use interpretation in accordance with section 125-41. If the city planner or designee determines that the proposed use does not fit any of the uses, no similar use interpretation shall be made, and an amendment to this zoning ordinance to permit the use must be processed in accordance with section 125-49. 
(c)  Residential use classifications.

A mixture of residential and commercial uses within walking distance, cottage style retail and office; including plazas, parks and nature open spaces. A suburban village development with majestic oak trees and landscaping developed in a street grid pattern, walkable and bike friendly. 
This classification shall be an integral part of the City's system for the survey and inventory of historic properties. 
b.  Amendments to existing regulations are as follows: 
1.  Parking. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may issue a special exception to relax parking regulations in this District, to the extent necessary to preserve or protect an historic building or place (or large tree). Relaxation may include the use of off-site spaces, leased spaces, tandem spaces, shared spaces, on-street spaces, etc. 
2.  Sidewalks are not required in this District, except adjacent to non-residential occupancies. The historic preservation officer may approve alternate sidewalk designs and materials (including flexible pavement and crushed stone) to the extent necessary to preserve or protect an historic building or place (or large tree). 
3.  Curbs and gutters are not required in this District, except along major arterials or thoroughfares. 
4.  Platting decisions affecting property in this District shall not be made until the proposed decision is referred to the Historic Commission for review and comment. 
5.  Interpretations and variances. All City officials, boards and commissions are authorized and encouraged to: (i) interpret and apply other ordinances, rules and regulations liberally to minimize conflicts with this Preservation Plan and to preserve and protect historic buildings and places, (ii) consider the need to preserve or protect an historic building or place as grounds for "hardship," whenever a hardship is required for an exception or variance, subject to applicable state law. 
c.  Architectural regulations to guide the issuance of certificates of appropriateness are the League City Historic District Design & Materials Guidelines, originally adopted by City Council by Resolution No. 2008-53, December 9, 2008, and hereby readopted and incorporated into this Ordinance by reference. Such regulations apply to other structures and places, even if no certificate of appropriateness is required. 
d.  Health and safety regulations shall apply within this District, but subject to the provisions of Section "b" of this Plan. Also, city officials, boards and commissions are authorized and encouraged to seek and approve creative and alternative means of compliance with health and safety regulations, to the extent necessary to preserve or protect historic buildings and places. 
e.  Buildings or places which lack historical, architectural, or cultural importance or value must comply with the provisions of this Preservation Plan. However, all city officials, boards and commissions are authorized and encouraged to: (i) interpret this Preservation Plan liberally in connection with buildings or places which lack historical, architectural or cultural importance or value, with the objective of achieving compatibility with properties nearby and to preserve and protect the integrity of the overall District, and (ii) consider the circumstances of such buildings or places in connection with any requested exception or variance from the provisions of this Preservation Plan.
