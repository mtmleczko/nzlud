PREFACE 
    The Part II, Code of Ordinances constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rowlett, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through Supplement 23(a), September 2001, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code Part II, Code of Ordinances. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code Part II, Code of Ordinances, have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code Part II, Code of Ordinances, together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code Part II, Code of Ordinances, is included at the back of volume II. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Part II, Code of Ordinances is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in volumes I and II is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Part II, Code of Ordinances, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of parts III-V and an appendix, the letters immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to George Harris, Fire Marshal, Kaythie Darnell, former City Secretary and the other members of the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(Code 1982, § 7-1-5) 
Sec. 30-36. - Assessment and collection of impact fees. 
(a)  Impact fees shall be assessed at the time the plats are released for recordation. Transportation impact fees shall be collected prior to issuance of a building permit; water and wastewater impact fees shall be collected prior to placement of a utilities meter. Fees for property which was platted prior to June 19, 1990, and for property proposed to occur without platting shall be assessed at any time and shall be collected prior to the issuance of any building permit or site excavation. 
(b)  Additional impact fees or increases in fees shall not be assessed unless the number of service units to be developed on the tract increases. Should the service units be increased, impact fees shall be increased in an amount equal to the current impact fee per service unit multiplied by the difference in number of service units. 
(c)  Except for roadway facilities, impact fees may be assessed but not collected for property where service is not available unless: 
(1)  The city commits to commence construction of necessary facilities identified in the capital improvements plan within two years and have service available in a reasonable time not exceeding five years; or 
(2)  The city agrees in writing to permit the owner of the property to construct or finance the required capital improvement or facility expansion and agrees that the costs incurred or funds advanced will either: 
a.  Be credited against the impact fees otherwise due from the new development; 
b.  Reimburse the owner for such costs from impact fees paid from other new developments that will use such capital improvements or facility expansions in which case fees shall be reimbursed to the owner at the time collected as other new development plats are recorded; or 
c.  The owner voluntarily requests that the city reserve capacity to serve future development and the city and the owner enter into a valid written agreement. 
(d)  The owner of the property for which there is a recorded plat may enter into a written agreement with the city providing for the time and method of payment of impact fees, which agreement shall prevail over any contrary provision of this article. 
(Code 1982, § 7-1-6) 
Sec. 30-37. - Calculation of impact fees. 
(a)  Impact fees shall be determined by multiplying the number of service units in the proposed development by the amount per service unit. The number of service units shall be determined by using the conversion table contained in the capital improvements plan. 
(b)  The determination of impact fees shall be reduced by any allowable credits for the category of capital improvements as provided by section 30-38. 
(c)  The total amount of unpaid impact fees shall be attached to the development application, or, if to be paid at some later date, to the request for other permit or connection. 
(d)  Replatting shall not require recalculation of impact fees unless the number of service units is increased. If a proposed development increases the number of service units, the impact fee shall be recalculated as provided by section 30-36. 
(e)  In many instances, a specific proposed new development will not be clearly listed within the impact fee ordinance schedule of fees. In such case, the city manager shall utilize an expanded list of land users to more clearly identify such new development. If the proposed new development is also not included on the expanded list of land users, the city manager may utilize data from the latest edition of the Trip Generation Report of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) or current reliable meter flow equivalencies, to determine appropriate impact fees for the new development in question. 
(f)  Nonresidential new development may include a mixture of land uses. In such instances, impact fees shall be calculated only on those land uses comprising at least 25 percent of the total square footage. Remaining square footage, if any, shall be assessed on a pro rata basis with the portions equaling or exceeding 25 percent. 
(Code 1982, § 7-1-7) 
Sec. 30-38. - Alternative impact fee calculations. 
(a)  If an applicant believes that the impact to the capital improvements of the city necessitated by a new development is less than the fees established by this article, such applicant may, prior to issuance of final plat approval for such new development, submit a calculation of an alternative impact fee to the city manager pursuant to the provisions of this section. The city manager shall review the calculations and make a determination within ten business days of submittal as to whether such calculations comply with the requirements of this section. 
(b)  The alternative impact fee calculations shall be based on data or assumptions contained in this article, its support schedules and studies, or independent sources, provided that: 
(1)  The independent source is a generally accepted standard source of planning information and cost impact analysis performed pursuant to a generally accepted methodology of planning and cost impact analysis consistent with the impact fee studies; 
(2)  The independent source is a local study supported by a data base adequate for the conclusions contained in such study performed to a generally accepted methodology of planning and costs impact analysis which is consistent with the impact fee studies; or 
(3)  The independent source is based upon recent available data from the Trip Generation Report by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), Criteria for Sewerage Systems of the Texas Natural Resources Commission, or current reliable meter flow equivalencies for the land use in question. 
(c)  Submittal of an alternative impact fee calculation must be accompanied by a review fee as established by resolution of the city council for each type for which alternative calculations are prepared. Such fee will be held in escrow by the city until a final determination is made on the actual impact fee payment to be made. However, should an applicant submit an alternative utility impact fee calculation on the sole basis of having placed multiple tenant meters within a single structure, no review fee shall be required. 
(d)  If the city manager determines that the data and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative impact fee comply with the requirements of this section, the alternative impact fee shall be paid by that new development in lieu of the fees established by this article. However, should the alternative impact fee vary from the fee schedule by more than $50,000.00, approval by a majority of the city council shall be required. The review fee shall be applied to the amount owed by the applicant. Should the review fee exceed the amount of the impact fee, the difference will be returned to the applicant within 30 calendar days of a final decision. 
(e)  If the city manager determines that the data and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative impact fee do not comply with the requirements of this section, then the city shall provide to the applicant written notification of the rejection of the alternative impact fees and the reason therefor. The review fees shall not be refunded in this event. The applicant shall have 30 calendar days from receipt of this written notification of rejection to request a hearing before the city council pursuant to section 30-42. 
(Code 1982, § 7-1-8; Ord. No. 013-07, § 1, 5-15-2007) 
Sec. 30-39. - Changes of size and use; exemptions for replacement. 
(a)  Impact fees shall be imposed and calculated for the alteration, expansion, or replacement of a building or dwelling unit or the construction of an accessory building if the alteration, expansion, or replacement of the building or dwelling or the construction of an accessory building results in a land use determined to increase the number of dwelling units; increase the usable square footage (or other type of service unit measure); change the land use so as to constitute a different impact fee land use category; or increases the size of the utility meters. Such fees shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  The impact fees shall be the amounts due under the applicable rate for the land use or meter size category resulting from the alteration, expansion, or replacement, less the impact fee that would be imposed under the applicable impact fee rate for the land use or meter size category prior to alteration, expansion, or replacement. In determining the impact fee which would have been in place for the land use category prior to alteration, expansion, or replacement, the use of land during the previous three years which provided the highest impact upon the city's capital improvements shall be utilized. 
(2)  The transportation impact fee for any accessory building shall be that applicable under the rate for the land use of the primary structure. 
(b)  The following shall be exempted from payment of impact fees: 
(1)  Alterations, expansion, or replacement of an existing dwelling unit which does not increase the number of families for which such dwelling unit is arranged, designed, or intended to accommodate for the purpose of providing living quarters. 
(2)  The alteration or expansion of an accessory building or structure which will not create additional dwelling units or will not increase the usable square footage space (or other service unit measure) associated with the principal building or of the land or will not change the utility meter size. 
(3)  The replacement of a dwelling unit or a building with a new dwelling unit or building of the same size and use, and same utility meter size, which will not increase the square footage associated therewith; provided, however, that the replacement of the dwelling unit or building which has been destroyed, moved, or otherwise rendered uninhabitable must be replaced within three years of the date it was destroyed, moved, or otherwise rendered uninhabitable in order to be exempt from payment of impact fees. 
(Code 1982, § 7-1-9) 
Sec. 30-40. - Credits. 
(a)  Any construction of, contributions to, or dedications of any facility appearing on the capital improvements plan which is required to be constructed by the city as a condition of development shall be credited against the impact fees otherwise due for the same category of impact fees otherwise due from the development. 
(b)  The amount of each credit for required construction of a facility on the capital improvements plan shall be calculated by multiplying the value of the facility assessed for the capital improvements plan by a fraction, the numerator of which is the impact fee per service unit due for the new development computed and the denominator of which is the maximum impact fee per service unit computed using the plan. 
(c)  As an alternative to the foregoing, the city and the owner may enter into an agreement providing that in addition to the credit, the owner will be reimbursed for all or a portion of the costs of such facilities from impact fees as received from other new developments that will use such capital improvements or facility expansions. 
(d)  An owner shall be entitled to a credit against any category of impact fee as provided in any written agreement between the city and the owner. 
(e)  No credit for construction of any facility shall exceed the total amount of impact fees due from the development for the same category of improvements.

(a)  All impact fees collected shall be deposited in interest bearing accounts clearly identifying the category of capital improvements or facility expansions within the service area for which the fee is adopted. 
(b)  Interest earned shall be credited to the account and shall be subject to the same restrictions on expenditures as the funds generating such interest. 
(c)  Impact fees and the interest earned thereon may be spent only for the purposes for which such fees were imposed as shown in the capital improvements plan. 
(d)  The records of the accounts into which impact fees are deposited shall be open for public inspection and copying during ordinary business hours. 
(Code 1982, § 7-1-11) 
Sec. 30-42. - Appeals. 
(a)  The property owner or applicant for new development may appeal the following decisions to the city council: 
(1)  The applicability of an impact fee to the development; 
(2)  The amount of the impact fee due; 
(3)  The availability or the amount of an offset or credit; 
(4)  The application of an offset or credit against an impact fee due; 
(5)  The amount of a refund due, if any. 
(b)  The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that the amount of the fee or the amount of the offset or credit was not calculated according to the applicable schedule of impact fees or the guidelines established for determining offsets and credits. 
(c)  The applicant must file a notice of appeal with the city secretary within 30 days following the decision. If the notice of appeal is accomplished by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the city attorney in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact fee due, the development application may be processed while the appeal is pending. 
(Code 1982, § 7-1-12) 
Sec. 30-43. - Refunds. 
(a)  On the request of an owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid, impact fees shall be refunded if existing facilities are available and service is denied or if the city failed to commence construction of facilities required for service within two years of payment of the fee or if such construction is not completed within a reasonable time but not, in any event, in more than five years from the date of payment of the fee. 
(b)  Upon completion of capital improvements or facility expansions identified in the capital improvements or facility expansions identified in the capital improvements plan, the impact fee shall be recalculated utilizing actual costs. If the impact fee based on actual cost is less than the impact fee paid, the city shall refund the difference if such difference exceeds the impact fee paid by more than ten percent. 
(c)  Any impact fee funds not expended within ten years after payment shall be refunded. 
(d)  If a building permit issued for a new development expires prior to completion of the development for which it was issued, the applicant may, within 90 days of the expiration of the building permit, apply for a refund of the impact fees, less three percent of the amount paid. Failure to apply for a refund within the 90 days shall waive any right to a refund. 
(e)  Refunds shall bear interest calculated from the date of collection the date of refund at the statutory rate set forth in Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 5067-11.03, or its successor statute. 
(f)  All refunds shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid. However, if the impact fees were paid by another political subdivision or governmental entity, payment shall be made to the policy subdivision or governmental entity. 
(g)  The owner of the property on which an impact fee has been paid or another political subdivision or governmental entity that paid the impact fee has standing to sue for a refund under this section. 
(Code 1982, § 7-1-13)

(Ord. No. 007-15, § 1, 2-17-2015) 
Sec. 40-15. - Amended permits. 
(a)  An operator shall submit an application to the city to amend an existing oil/gas well permit to commence drilling from a new drill site that is not shown on (or incorporated by reference as part of) the existing permit, to relocate a drill site or operation site that is shown on (or incorporated by reference as part of) the existing permit, or to otherwise amend the existing permit. 
(b)  Applications for amended oil/gas well permits shall be in writing, shall be on forms provided by the city, shall be signed by the operator, and shall include the following: 
(1)  The application fee as set by the city's adopted fee schedule; 
(2)  A description of the proposed amendments; 
(3)  Any changes to the information submitted with the application for the existing oil/gas well permit (if such information has not previously been provided to the city); 
(4)  Such additional information as is reasonably required by the city to demonstrate compliance with the applicable development plat, site plan, applicable special use permit or planned development zoning district; and 
(5)  Such additional information as is reasonably required by the city to prevent imminent destruction of property or injury to persons. 
(c)  All applications for amended oil/gas well permits shall be filed with the city secretary who shall then immediately forward said amended application to the planning and zoning commission for review. Incomplete applications may be returned to the applicant, in which case the city shall provide a written explanation of the deficiencies; however, the city may retain a processing fee as determined by the city. The city may return any application as incomplete if there is a dispute pending before the railroad commission regarding the determination of the operator. 
(d)  If the activities proposed by the amendment are not materially different from the activities covered by the existing oil/gas well permit, and if the proposed activities are in conformance with the applicable development plat, site plan, or applicable special use permit, then the planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to approve the amendment within ten days after the application is filed. 
(e)  If the activities proposed by the amendment are materially different from the activities covered by the existing oil/gas well permit, and if the proposed activities are in conformance with the applicable development plat, site plan, or the applicable special use permit, then the planning and zoning commission shall approve the amendment within 30 days after the application is filed. If, however, the activities proposed by the amendment are materially different and, in the judgment of the planning and zoning commission, might create a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons that was not associated with the activities covered by the existing permit or that was not otherwise taken into consideration by the existing permit, the planning and zoning commission may require the amendment to be processed as a new oil/gas well permit application. 
(f)  The failure of the planning and zoning commission to review and issue an amended oil/gas well permit within a reasonable specified time limit shall not cause the application for the amended permit to be deemed approved.

(1)  For any closure of a traffic lane or blocking of a sidewalk or alley lasting six days or less, the permittee shall conspicuously mark its vehicles with the permittee's or contractor's name and telephone number. 
(2)  For projects scheduled to last more than six calendar days a three feet by three feet informational sign stating the identity of the person doing the work, a local telephone number and owner's identity shall be placed at the location where construction is to occur prior to the beginning of work in the public rights-of-way and shall continue to be placed at the location during the entire time the work is occurring. The informational sign will be posted on public right-of-way 100 feet before the construction location commences, unless other posting arrangements are approved or required by the director. 
(3)  When projects last more than two calendar days, the owner shall also provide written notification to all adjacent property occupants prior to the beginning of construction. Informational fliers shall include identity of the person doing the work, a local telephone number, owner's identity, and proposed schedule. 
(4)  Projects in public easements on private property, or in rights-of-way adjacent to private property that is likely to be disturbed, require notification by flier as in (3) above. 
(d)  Approved erosion control measures and advance warning signs, markers, cones and barricades must be in place before construction begins. Advance warning must comply with the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(e)  Lane closures on major thoroughfares will be limited to one lane between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. unless the director grants prior approval or in case of emergency. Arrow boards will be required for lane closures on all arterials and collectors, with all barricades, advanced warning signs and 36-inch reflector cones placed according to the Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(f)  Without affecting the legal relationship between the owner and their contractor, owners are responsible for any damages by their contractors or subcontractors. A responsible representative of the owner will be reasonably available to the department at all times during construction. 
(g)  Owner shall be responsible for storm water management, dust control, erosion control, employee sanitation and excavation safety measures that comply with city, state and federal guidelines effective at time of permit issuance.

(i)  No open trench or cut shall be permitted in an alley or street with a pavement condition index (PCI) greater than 85 unless in the case of emergency. Such open cuts in pavements with PCI>85 shall be considered to deplete the useful life of that segment of pavement, causing owner to replace the pavement fill width and length of the entire disturbed or cut panel (limits identified by nearest existing sawed control joint or construction joint). Pavements with PCI<86 may be permitted to be open cut. Repair of all street and sidewalk removals must be made promptly to avoid safety hazards to vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and shall be in accordance with city general construction specifications. All disturbances in the public rights-of-way shall be restored as required in section 54-160.

No work will be done, except for emergencies, on Sundays or city holidays. 
(o)  Persons working in the public rights-of-way are responsible for obtaining line locates in accordance with state and federal underground facility damage prevention and safety laws (one-call/call before you dig laws) from all affected utilities or others with facilities in the public rights-of-way prior to any excavation. Use of a geographic information system or the plans of records does not satisfy this requirement. 
(p)  Owner will be responsible for verifying the location, both horizontal and vertical depth, of all facilities. When required by the department, owner shall verify locations by pot holing, hand digging or other method approved by the department prior to any excavation or boring. 
(q)  Placement of all manholes and/or handholes must be approved in advance by the department. Handholes or manholes will not be located in sidewalks, unless approved by the director. 
(r)  Locate flags shall not be removed from a location while facilities are being constructed. 
(s)  When construction requires pumping of water or mud, the water or mud shall be contained in accordance with federal and state law and the directives of the department. 
(t)  A person shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements, at time of permit issuance including the obligation to use trench-less technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations on other similar users of the public rights-of-way. The city shall waive the requirements of trench-less technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information provided to the city by the person. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. A person shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city in order to minimize any such interference. 
(u)  Excavation safety. On construction projects in which excavation will exceed a depth of five feet, the agency must have detailed plans and specifications for excavation safety systems. The term "excavation" includes trenches, structural or any construction that has earthen excavation subject to collapse. The excavation safety plan shall be designed in conformance with state law and occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) standards and regulations.

All the requirements specified for the plans submitted for the initial permit, as set forth in section 54-154(b), shall be submitted and updated in the "record drawings or plans." Users which have facilities in the public rights-of-way existing as of the date of this article who have not provided "record drawings or plans" shall provide one-quarter of the information concerning facilities in city right-of-way within one year after the passage of this article and one-quarter each six months thereafter. The detail and accuracy will concern issues such as location, size of facilities, materials used, and any other health, safety and welfare concerns. Public rights-of-way users will provide the director with updates to the "record drawings or plans" of facilities in the public rights-of-way annually. The record drawings or plans shall represent the actual facilities as detailed and accurately as reasonably possible. Submittal of "record drawings or plans" shall be in digital format and one set of plans in a paper format. 
(b)  If record drawings or plans submitted under this section include information expressly designated by the owner as a trade secret or other confidential information protected from disclosure by state law, the director may not disclose that information to the public without the consent of the owner, unless otherwise compelled by an opinion of the attorney general pursuant to the Texas Open Records Act, as amended, or by a court having jurisdiction of the matter pursuant to applicable law. This subsection may not be construed to authorize an owner to designate all matters in its as-built plans as confidential or as trade secrets. 
(c)  Record drawings or plans submitted under this section are for the general informational purposes of the city only. They shall not be relied upon by city or other owners performing construction in the public rights-of-way. City and owners will be responsible for verifying the location of all facilities.

The permittee shall not interfere with any existing improvements without the written consent of the director and the person owning the improvements. If it becomes necessary to remove an existing improvement, its owner shall do this. No improvements owned by the city shall be removed to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work is borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned improvements shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless he makes other arrangements with the person owning the improvement. The permittee shall protect any improvements that may be in any way affected by his work. In case any of said improvements should be damaged, they shall be repaired in conformance with all applicable requirements by the permittee, and his or its bond shall be liable therefor.

The copy of the required permit shall be admissible in evidence in any cause in which the gross registered weight of such vehicle is an issue, and shall be prima facie evidence of the gross weight for which such vehicle is permitted. Such copy of the permit shall be displayed to any officer authorized to enforce this article, upon request by such officer. The issuance of a permit for an overweight movement shall not be a guarantee by the city that the streets can safely accommodate such movement, and the owner of any vehicle involved in any overweight movement, whether with or without permit, shall be strictly liable for any damage such movement shall cause the streets or any of its structures or appurtenances. 
(d)  Fees. It is recognized that the movement of such overweight vehicles is a privilege not accorded to every user of the city streets, and its logical and proper that the fees to be charged for special transportation will be established by resolution of the city council.

If the gross weight of the vehicle exceeds the permitted gross weight, the police officer shall cite the operator/owner of such vehicle for being in violation of the provisions of this article; provided, however, that if such load consists of livestock or perishable merchandise, then such operator or owner shall be permitted to proceed with his vehicle to the nearest practical point in the direction of his destination where his load may be protected from damage or destruction if he is required to secure an additional permit before being allowed to proceed. It shall be conclusively presumed and deemed prima facie evidence that where an operator or owner is apprehended and found to be carrying a greater gross load than that for which he is permitted, he has been carrying similar loads from the date of purchase of such permit.

(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-212. - General sewer use requirements. 
(a)  Prohibited discharge standards. No industrial user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass-through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all industrial users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirement. Furthermore, no industrial user may contribute the following substances to the POTW: 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in either the municipal wastewater collection system or POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
(2)  Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 11.0, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment, or endangering city personnel. 
(3)  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow either in the conveyance system or in the POTW resulting in interference. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, for example), released in a discharge at a flow rate or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with either the POTW or any wastewater treatment or sludge process, or which will constitute a hazard to humans or animals. 
(5)  Any wastewater having a temperature greater than 150 degrees F (65 degrees C), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees F (40 degrees C). 
(6)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through. 
(7)  Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(8)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the city and in accordance with subsection 70-213(e). 
(9)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance, a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(10)  Any wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the POTW's effluent. 
(11)  Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, and unpolluted industrial wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the control authority. 
(12)  Any sludge, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes. 
(13)  Any wastewater containing pollutants deemed highly toxic by the city and discharged at a flow volume capable of causing toxicity at the POTW. 
(14)  Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents, or other substances which cause excessive foaming in the POTW. 
(15)  Any discharge of fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in excess of 200 mg/l (1668 pounds per million gallons) which causes sewer clogs, interference, pass-through, or which exceeds the grease handling capacity of the POTW. 
(16)  Any wastewater from an underground storage tank or tank hole containing gasoline, motor oils or lubricating oils, unless specifically authorized by the control authority. 
(17)  Any pollutant in an amount which singly or in combination with discharges from other industrial users creates an influent or sludge concentration at the POTW approaching, equal to or exceeding the MAHL for that pollutant as established by the city except as specifically approved by the control authority. 
    Wastes prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. All floor drains located in process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's pretreatment facility before connecting with the POTW. 
(b)  Federal categorical pretreatment standards. The national categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated by reference. 
(c)  Specific pollutant limitations. 
(1)  The following uniform concentration-based pollutant limits are established to protect against pass-through, sludge contamination, and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following maximum allowable discharge limits: 
Allowable 
Pollutant Sample 
Concentration Type Arsenic 1.00 mg/l Composite Chromium 2.50 mg/l Composite Copper 2.20 mg/l Composite Mercury 0.10 mg/l Composite Nickel 3.00 mg/l Composite Zinc 3.0 mg/l Composite  
(2)  The following industrial contributory flow-based pollutant limits are established due to the pollutant's risk of producing toxicity in the receiving streams. All industrial users shall be prohibited form discharging industrial contributory flow-based pollutants at concentrations exceeding those normally found in domestic sewage, unless specifically allowed by the control authority in the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit. The maximum allowable concentration of industrial contributory flow-based pollutants shall be: 
Maximum 
Pollutant Allowable 
Concentration Sample 
Type Cadmium 0.50 mg/l Composite Cyanide 1.00 mg/l Grab Lead 1.50 mg/l Composite Silver 1.50 mg/l Composite  
Concentrations apply at the point where the industrial waste is discharged to the POTW unless otherwise specified by the control authority. All concentrations are for "total" substance unless indicated otherwise. At his discretion, the control authority may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitation above. 
(d)  City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance, or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in subsection 70-211(a) of this article or the general and specific prohibitions in subsection 70-212(a) of this article. 
(e)  Special agreement. The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. An industrial user may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user proves that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions of 40 CFR 403.13. 
(f)  Dilution. No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The city may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-213. - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
(a)  Pretreatment facilities. Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in Section 22.141(A) above within the time limitations specified by the approval authority, the control authority, or the city, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's sole expense. Detailed plans (sealed by a registered, professional engineer) showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All intersection units shall be of type and capacity approved by the city and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, maintained in proper operating condition and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his expense. No in-line provisions for bypass of grease, oil or sand interceptors shall be allowed. 
(2)  Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(3)  At no time shall two readings on a combustible gas detection meter at the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, be more than ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. 
(c)  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. The city may require any industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. At least once every two years, the city shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such a plan. Any industrial user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the city and the control authority of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any of the prohibited discharges in subsection 70-212(a) of this article; and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(d)  Tenant responsibility. Where an owner of property leases premises to another person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this article. 
(e)  Hauled wastewater. The discharge of hauled industrial wastes as "industrial sewage" requires prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit from the city. The city or the control authority shall have authority to prohibit the disposal of such wastes. Waste haulers are subject to all other sections of this article. 
(f)  Vandalism. No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in sections 70-220 and 70-221 of this article. 
(g)  Act of God defense. 
(1)  The act of God defense constitutes a statutory affirmative defense (see V.T.C.A. Texas Water Code, § 7.251) in an action brought in municipal or state court. If a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance, or a permit issued under the ordinance, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe, the event is not a violation of the ordinance or permit. 
(2)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the act of God affirmative defense shall demonstrate through relevant evidence that: 
a.  An event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under the ordinance occurred, and the sole cause of the event was an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe; and 
b.  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event that would otherwise be in violation of a pretreatment ordinance or a permit issued under the ordinance (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
i.  A description of the event, and the nature and cause of the event; 
ii.  The time period of the event, including exact dates and times or, if still continuing, the anticipated time the event is expected to continue; and 
iii.  Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent the event. 
(3)  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the act of God affirmative defense shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a pretreatment ordinance, or a permit issued under the ordinance, was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe. 
(h)  Bypass. No industrial user shall intentionally divert waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility (bypass) unless all procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.17 are met. 
(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-214. - Wastewater discharge permit eligibility. 
(a)  Wastewater survey. When requested by the city, all industrial users must submit information on the nature and characteristics of their wastewater by completing a wastewater survey. The city is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require industrial users to update the survey. Failure to complete this survey shall be reasonable grounds for terminating service to the industrial user and shall be considered a violation of this article. 
(b)  Wastewater discharge permit requirement. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user to discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the city. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in sections 70-220 and 70-221. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and local law. 
(2)  The city may require other industrial users, including liquid waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article. 
(c)  Wastewater discharge permitting for existing connections. Any significant industrial user which discharges industrial waste into the POTW prior to the effective date of this article and which wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall, within 60 days after the effective date, apply to the city for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with subsection 70-214(f) below, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 90 days of the effective date of this article except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the city. 
(d)  Wastewater discharge permitting. Any significant industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging industrial wastes into the POTW must obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge permit must be filed at least 30 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin. 
(e)  Wastewater discharge permit application contents. In order to be considered for a wastewater discharge permit, all industrial users required to have a wastewater discharge permit shall submit the information required by subsection 70-216(a)(2) of this article. The city shall provide a form to be used as a permit application. In addition, the following information shall be submitted: 
(1)  Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on the premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used or stored at the facility which are, or could accidentally or intentionally be, discharged to the POTW; 
(2)  Number and type of employees, hours of operation, hours of discharge and proposed or actual hours of operation of the industrial user; 
(3)  Each product produced by type, amount, process or processes, and rate of production; 
(4)  A map of the property showing accurately all sewers and drains; 
(5)  The site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans, and details to show all sewers, floor drains, and appurtenances by size, location, and elevation, and all points of discharge; 
(6)  Time and duration of all the discharges; 
(7)  Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the city to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit application; and 
(8)  Plans and specifications sealed by a registered professional engineer detailing all pretreatment facilities and processes including any grease, oil or sand interceptors and control manholes. 
    Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the industrial user for revision. 
(g)  Application signatories and certification. All wastewater discharge permit applications and industrial user reports must contain the following certification statement and be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user: 
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(h)  Wastewater discharge permit decisions. The city shall evaluate the data furnished by the industrial user and may require additional information. Within 20 working days of receipt of a complete wastewater discharge permit application, the city shall determine whether or not to issue a wastewater discharge permit. If no determination is made within this time period, the application shall be deemed denied. The city may deny any application for a wastewater discharge permit based upon the provisions of this article, other applicable local law, or applicable state or federal law. Any applicant denied a wastewater discharge permit may appeal the city decision to the industrial waste board in accordance with subsection 70-215(f).

(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-216. - Reporting requirements. 
(a)  Baseline monitoring reports. 
(1)  Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing significant industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW, shall submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subsection (2), below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subsection (2), below. A new source shall also report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged. 
(2)  The industrial user shall submit the following information required by this section including: 
a.  Identifying information. The name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners. 
b.  Wastewater discharge permits. A list of any environmental control wastewater discharge permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description shall include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  Identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process; 
2.  Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (and mass, where required by the standard or by the city) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-term average concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection 70-216(j). 
3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection 70-216(k). 
f.  Certification. A statement reviewed and signed by the industrial user's authorized representative indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and operations and maintenance (O&M) will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and O&M shall be required. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
h.  All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 70-214(g). 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress report. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by subsection 70-216(a)(2)g. The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed 30 days. The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the city no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than 30 days elapse between such progress reports to the city. 
(c)  Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in subsections 70-216(a)(2)d-f. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), the report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 70-214(g). 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard shall, on the dates and at a frequency determined by the city but in no case less than twice per year, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by such pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 70-214(g). 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in subsections 70-216(j) and (k) of this article the results of such monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Report of changed conditions. Each industrial user is required to notify the city of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least five working days before the change. 
(1)  The city may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection 70-214(f). 
(2)  The city may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 70-215. 
(3)  No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the city has responded to the industrial user's notice. 
(4)  For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 100 percent of the average daily or monthly flow (based on the previous year averages) or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed significant. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in subsection 70-212(a) of this article), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the city and control authority of the incident. Notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other law. 
(3)  Failure to notify the city and control authority of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this article. 
(4)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (1), above. Industrial users shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)  Reports from nonsignificant industrial users. All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as required by the city. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user shall notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the city, the control authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification shall include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges shall be submitted under subsection 70-216(e). 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user shall notify the city, the control authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  Industrial users that are permitted by the city shall submit a copy of all manifests to the city documenting offsite disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous waste. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (2), below, the industrial user shall collect wastewater samples using proportional composite collection techniques. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals shall be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(l)  Determination of noncompliance. The city may use a grab sample(s) to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards. 
(m)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date post-marked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(n)  Recordkeeping. Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records and information required to be retained under this article. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this article, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city. 
(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-217. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Inspection and sampling. The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof. Industrial users shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, control authority, state, and EPA will be permitted to enter without substantial delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The city, control authority, state, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the industrial user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the industrial user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated periodically to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the industrial facility to be inspected and sampled shall be promptly removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the industrial user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city personnel access to the industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the city has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any part thereof, and if the city has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the control authority designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then upon application the municipal court judge may issue a search and seizure warrant describing therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the city in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city. In the event of an emergency affecting public health or safety, inspections may be made without the issuance of a warrant. 
(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-218. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, except as may be required by the V.T.C.A. Texas Public Information Act, Ch. 552, Texas Government Code, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the TPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-219. - Publication of industrial users in significant noncompliance. 
    The city will publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the city, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous five quarters, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria [1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH]; 
(3)  Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through (including endangering the health of personnel or the general public); 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; and 
(8)  Any other violation(s) which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-220. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the city may serve upon the user a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of the receipt of a notice of violation, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city. Submission of the plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Show cause hearing. The city may order any user which causes or contributes to violation(s) of this article, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing may be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) and shall be served at least five working days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(c)  Emergency suspensions. The city may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of any person. The city may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any person. The city shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the city, prior to the date of any show cause hearing under subsection 70-220(b). 
    Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(d)  Permit suspension/termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions of subsection 70-214(e) of this article, any user that violates the following conditions of this section, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is subject to permit suspension and discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of any wastewater discharge permit condition or conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in subsection 70-211(a) of this article. 
    Such user shall be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection 70-220(b) of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-221. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  Any user that intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence, violates any provision of this article, any orders or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $2,000.00 per day per violation. 
(2)  Any user that intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence, introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not less than $1,000.00 nor more than $2,000.00 per violation per day. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. This penalty shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other enforcement remedy or cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under law. 
(3)  Any user that knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $2,000.00 per violation. 
(b)  Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this article, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the city may petition a court of proper jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas, through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the industrial user. Such other action as appropriate for legal or equitable relief may also be sought by the city. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions of this section are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations shall at minimum be consistent with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently. 
(Ord. No. 036-09, § 1, 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 70-222. - Supplemental enforcement action/water supply termination.

Subdivision IV. - Grease Interceptors 

Sec. 70-230. - General standards. 
(a)  The provisions of this subdivision shall apply to new and existing establishments, businesses, institutions, industrial users and any building, structure, facility or installation (collectively referred to in this subdivision as "establishments") from which there is or may be a recurring discharge of fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin into the city's sanitary sewer system in excess of normal household discharge. This subdivision is not intended to repeal any provision of subdivision III ("discharge regulations") of this article and, to the extent that any provision of subdivision III may conflict or be inconsistent with any provision of this subdivision, the more stringent provision shall apply. 
(b)  All Establishments shall use a grease interceptor or trap for every pre-sewer connection so as to prevent the discharge of fats, oils and greases into the sanitary sewer system. The grease trap shall be of a design approved by the city and shall be installed and used in compliance with this subdivision, the manufacturer's specifications, the provisions of the International Plumbing Code, as adopted and amended by the city, the food establishment rules applicable in the city, and all other applicable ordinances, codes and regulations. 
(c)  A grease trap shall be of adequate size and design to accommodate the discharge from the establishment at peak operating times. The minimum requirements for grease interceptors are as follows: 
(1)  All establishments shall install and use grease interceptors according to the following requirements: 
a.  All grease interceptors shall be located below grade on the exterior of the facility; provided, however, that indoor grease interceptors may be approved by the city. 
b.  Establishments with four fixtures or less shall have a minimum of a 250-pound capacity grease interceptor. 
c.  Establishments with more than four fixtures shall have a minimum of a 750-pound capacity grease interceptor. 
d.  The following items are considered a fixture: 
1.  each utensil sink (a three or four compartment utensil sink). 
2.  each food preparation sink. 
3.  each dishwasher. 
4.  each mop sink. 
5.  all floor drains will be considered as one fixture. 
6.  all hand sinks will be considered as one fixture. 
e.  Non-grease producing fixtures shall not be included in calculating fixture numbers (for example, items such as ice machine condensate, dipping wells, and hand sinks in restrooms). 
f.  All grease-bearing waste streams must be routed through an appropriate grease interceptor, including but not limited to three-compartment sinks, pot/pan sinks, soup kettles, kitchen-area hand-washing sinks, dishwashers, mop sinks and floor drains. Drains that receive "clear waste" only, such as from ice machines or condensate from coils and drink stations, may be plumbed to the sanitary sewer system without passing through the grease interceptor so long as the receiving drain is a "hub" type that is a minimum of two inches above the finished floor. 
g.  Grease interceptors shall be constructed with a minimum of two chambers, installed at a minimum distance of ten feet from sinks and dishwashers to allow for adequate cooling of the wastewater Water and wastewater temperatures must be less than 120 degrees prior to entering the grease interceptor. All grease interceptors must be installed with an effluent sampling well. 
(2)  No establishment shall use a grease interceptor with a capacity smaller than required by this section; provided, however, that the City may approve the use of a smaller capacity grease interceptor if, based on engineer-sealed plans containing drawings and flow calculations, the grease interceptor has a minimum two hour retention time, or if the nature of food preparation at the establishment involves the preparation of non-greasy food types or products. City approval of smaller capacity interceptors may be revoked or suspended at any time if the discharge from the establishment exceeds the capacity of the grease interceptor. 
(3)  The city may exempt existing establishments from the 750-pound interceptor requirement (five or more fixtures) if: 
a.  The existing interceptor is functional and is a two-compartment interceptor with a capacity of greater than 100 pounds; 
b.  There is no history of sewage backups, public sewer line blockages or BOD/COD violations from the establishment; 
c.  The anticipated meal-per-day volume or grease-produced volume is low such that the existing grease interceptor is adequate to accommodate anticipated peak time discharges; and 
d.  The establishment's interceptor service or pumping frequency is less than 90 days. Alternate service or pumping frequency may be authorized by the city if inspection or sample analyses support such actions. A state-licensed waste hauler must be hired for pumping and the establishment must retain records or manifests on-site of waste hauler service for at least two years.

Sec. 70-245. - Customer review. 
(a)  If a customer places pretreatment equipment in the business process or for any other reason improves the quality of effluent, a review process may be requested by the industrial customer. To obtain this review, all of the following steps must be taken: 
(1)  The customer must make a formal written request to the city council through the city secretary for this rate to be examined. 
(2)  Formal assurance must be supplied that a change in the effluent due to sewage pretreatment, product manufacturing change, or any other reason must be expected to remain in effect for at least 12 months or until the next scheduled rate review and change. 
(3)  The customer must agree that the cost of sampling by city staff (or any independent party at the city's election) to determine the new loading factors, plus the cost of two more samples to be taken at the city's own discretion, must be prepaid by the customer. If the city elects not to take additional samples or if the next samples are part of the regularly scheduled sampling plan, the cost of the prepaid samples will be refunded by the city to the customer. The cost for sampling will be as established by resolution of the city council each for a total of an amount established by resolution of the city council. 
(b)  The city shall have 45 days from the date the written request is received by the city secretary to take action. This will be in the form of a resolution acted upon by the city council. The effective date of the credit shall be the regular bills to the customer subsequent to the approved resolution by the council. 
(c)  A rate credit may be in order to be approved by the city council. The credit shall remain in effect until the next regular rate schedule has been put into effect by the city council unless the user's effluent increases significantly, in which case the provisions set forth in section 70-244 concerning surcharges shall apply. Should the rate be deemed entitled to be reduced, the maximum amount of the reduction to be allowed would be the variable costs associated with the new effluent loadings. The credit will be computed in the same manner as the surcharge.

PREFACE 
    The Part II, Code of Ordinances constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rowlett, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through Supplement 23(a), September 2001, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code Part II, Code of Ordinances. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code Part II, Code of Ordinances, have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code Part II, Code of Ordinances, together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code Part II, Code of Ordinances, is included at the back of volume II. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Part II, Code of Ordinances is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in volumes I and II is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Part II, Code of Ordinances, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of parts III-V and an appendix, the letters immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to George Harris, Fire Marshal, Kaythie Darnell, former City Secretary and the other members of the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

B.  Application to governmental units. To the extent allowed by law, the provisions of this Code shall apply to all land, buildings, structures, and uses owned by government agencies, including all municipal, state, and federal lands, within the corporate limits of the City of Rowlett and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
C.  Compliance required. No building or structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or altered for use, nor shall any land, building, or structure be used or changed, except in accordance with all of the applicable regulations established by this Code.

However, where conditions, standards, or requirements imposed by any provision of this Code are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable standards imposed by any other public law, ordinance, or regulation, the provisions that are more restrictive or that impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.

However, where the regulations of this Code are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easement, covenant, or other private agreement, then the requirements of this Code shall govern.

(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-106. - Transitional regulations.

A.  Violations continue. Any violation of the previous versions of Chapters 82, 90, 94, 98, or 102 of the Rowlett Code of Ordinances shall continue to be a violation under this Code and shall be subject to the penalties and enforcement set forth in Chapter 77-1000, Enforcement, unless the use, development, construction, or other activity complies with the provisions of this Code. Payment shall be required for any civil penalty assessed under the previous regulations, even if the original violation is no longer considered a violation under this Code. 
B.  Uses, structures, and lots rendered nonconforming. 
(1)  When a lot is used for a purpose that was a lawful use before the effective date of this Code, and this Code no longer classifies such use as an allowed use in the zoning district in which it is located, such use shall be considered nonconforming and shall be controlled by Chapter 77-900, Nonconformities. 
(2)  Where any building, structure, or lot that legally existed on the effective date of this Code does not meet all standards set forth in this Code, such building, structure, or lot shall be considered nonconforming and shall be controlled by Chapter 77-900, Nonconformities. 
C.  Processing of applications commenced or approved under previous ordinances.

Preliminary approvals granted under the previous code may be extended no more than once, and for no longer than 12 months, pursuant to the extension procedures applicable under the previous ordinance. 
(3)  Approved projects. 
(a)  Conditional use permits, subdivision plats, development plan approvals, grading permits, building permits, sign permits, variances, deviations, waivers, or minor modifications any of which are valid on the effective date of this Code, shall remain valid until their expiration date. Projects with valid approvals or permits may be carried out with the development standards in effect at the time of approval, provided that the permit or approval is valid and has not lapsed. 
(b)  Any building or development for which a building permit was granted prior to the effective date of this Code shall be permitted to proceed to construction even if such building or development does not conform to the provisions of this Code.

A.  If any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any provision of this Code, then such judgment shall not affect the validity and continued enforcement of any other provision of this Code.

CHAPTER 77-200. - ZONING DISTRICTS 

Sec. 77-201. - General provisions. 
    This chapter establishes the zoning districts and contains basic information pertaining to zoning districts, primarily statements of purpose and district-specific regulations. Chapter 77-300, Use regulations, and Chapter 77-400, Dimensional standards, set forth the uses allowed within the districts and the dimensional standards applying to development in the districts. 
A.  Districts established; zoning map. 
(1)  Zoning districts established. The city is divided into the following zoning districts:

(2)  Explanation of zoning district abbreviations. Zoning district abbreviations depict the category of use allowed (i.e. SF for single-family, C for commercial, MU for mixed use, etc.). In the residential zoning districts, the first set of numbers separated by a slash represents the minimum lot size in thousands of square feet, and the second number following the slash represents the minimum dwelling size in hundreds of square feet. (For example, i.e. SF-20/24 would indicate a minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet with a minimum dwelling size of 2,400 square feet). 
(3)  Zoning map. The zoning districts are shown on the official zoning map. Procedures for amending the official zoning map are set forth in subchapter 77-805, Rezonings. 
(a)  Boundaries generally. The boundaries of zoning districts set out in this Code are delineated upon the official zoning map, adopted as part of this Code as fully as if the same were set forth in this section in detail.

(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-204. - Mixed-use districts. 
A.  General purposes of all mixed-use districts. The mixed-use districts are established to provide for and encourage development and redevelopment that contains a compatible mix of residential and nonresidential uses within close proximity to each other. Mixed-use districts define the uses of land and the siting and character of the improvements and structures to promote compatibility between uses. Buildings are typically oriented so as to maximize visibility and provide a higher level of open space, landscaping, and architectural features. The districts are also intended to recognize areas where redevelopment of underutilized parcels and infill development of vacant parcels should consider pedestrian-oriented development. The mixed-use districts specifically are intended to: 
1.  Promote higher-density residential development near and within neighborhood and town centers, redevelopment/mixed use areas, major employment centers, and other areas as appropriate; 
2.  Concentrate higher-intensity commercial and office employment growth efficiently in and around major employment centers, town centers, and other centers of community activity; 
3.  Encourage mixed-use redevelopment, conversion, and reuse of aging and underutilized areas, and increase the efficient use of available commercial land in the city; 
4.  Create pedestrian-oriented urban environments that encourage transit use and pedestrian access; 
5.  Concentrate a variety of commercial retail/services and public facilities that serve the surrounding community; and 
6.  Ensure that the appearance and function of residential and nonresidential uses are of high and unique aesthetic character and quality, and are integrated with one another and the character of the area in which they are located. 
B.  Specific purposes of individual mixed-use districts. 
1.  Mixed-Use Waterfront District-MU-WF. The MU-WF district is intended to accommodate a variety of moderate-intensity nonresidential entertainment and retail uses that take advantage of lakefront locations and views. It is intended to be applied to waterfront locations, including, but not limited to, that area proposed for retail-waterfront uses in the downtown plan. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 013-13, § 2, 5-21-2013; Ord. No. 022-14, § 2, 6-3-2014) 
Sec. 77-205. - Special purpose and overlay districts. 
    The following special purpose and overlay zone districts are hereby established by the city, and each such district is intended for the purposes described below. 
A.  Planned Development District-PD. The PD district is a district that accommodates planned associations of various uses such as manufacturing, offices, commercial or service centers, shopping centers, residential developments of multiple or mixed housing, or any appropriate combination of uses that may be planned, developed, or operated as integrated land uses. 
The PD district is intended to be used to: 
1.  Allow integrations of various land uses, or 
2.  Accommodate the use of alternative development standards and integration of uses that result in a higher quality of development that can be achieved by other zoning districts. 
3.  Permit the imposition of development regulations specifically tailored to the development and the provisions of this Code; and, the city council shall establish, as part of the approving ordinance, appropriate plans and development standards which may conform, alter or except any of the designs standards and requirement adopted under this Code. 
B.  Take Line District-TL. Lake Ray Hubbard is owned by the City of Dallas. In addition to the lake, the City of Dallas owns areas adjacent to the lake. The TL district is intended for the regulation of those areas along the shores of Lake Ray Hubbard that are owned and/or are regulated by the City of Dallas. The City of Dallas and the City of Rowlett have imposed additional requirements for land use activities and development in such areas, and the City of Rowlett implements those requirements. Development or construction proposals in these areas will be subject to said regulations as adopted, as amended. 
C.  Industrial Overlay District-IO. The IO industrial overlay district is intended to accommodate industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and assembly plants and facilities typically allowed in the light manufacturing (M-1) and general manufacturing (M-2) districts by modifying certain development and use standards in order to facilitate economic development. The regulations applicable within this district are designed to accommodate entrepreneurship and function as an incubator area for small businesses, maintain development consistent with the comprehensive plan, protect the character of this area and neighboring residential areas, and enhance two major entryways into the city-The DART Rail Corridor and Lakeview Parkway. 
D.  Form Based District-FB District. The FB district is designed to achieve a more positive and sustainable outcome for development, to improve the quality of life both within new and infill development, to enhance property values, and to improve the overall perception of the city within the region. The regulations combine minimum and maximum specifications with standards for site layout, building design and streetscaping. It provides for flexibility among compatible uses to allow developers and the city to respond to changing market demands, and encourages parking that increases land use efficiency and minimizes disruption of the public realm. Except where noted, FB district regulations supplant the application of conflicting provisions in this Code. 
The City of Rowlett's Form Based Code, containing the comprehensive regulations applicable to all areas zoned as FB district will be maintained in the office of the city secretary and in the office of the city's planning department and will be made available for review and copying. 
Any provision in the FB district regulations that conflicts with this Code or any other city regulation will govern and control. The specifications for and quality of construction and installation of all infrastructure will comply with the rules, regulations, standards and requirements of the city. The codes and ordinances of the city will continue to be applicable to matters not covered by the FB district regulations except where the city's other codes and ordinances would contradict the intent and purpose stated in the FB district regulations, in which case the conflict will be resolved in favor of the FB district regulations. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 002-12, § 2, 1-3-2012; Ord. No. 028-12, § 2, 11-6-2012) 
Editor's note- Section 5 of Ord. No. 028-12, adopted Nov. 6, 2012, states "that an offense committed before the effective date (11-6-2012) of said ordinance is governed by the prior law and the provisions of the Code of Ordinances, as amended, in effect when the offense was committed and the former law is continued in effect for this purpose." 
Sec. 77-206. - Special use permits. 
A.  Special use permits-SUP. A special use permit is a formal zoning action that encourages public review and evaluation of site development features and is intended to ensure that proposed uses will not have a significant adverse impact on surrounding uses, infrastructure, the transportation corridors, or on the community at large. The purpose is not to relieve particular hardships, nor to confer special privileges or rights on any person. The special use permit review and approval procedure provides a discretionary approval process for development and uses that may have unique or widely varying operating characteristics or unusual site development features. Special use permits shall not be used as a way to legitimize nonconforming structures or uses, and shall not be used when a variance, deviation, waiver or minor modification could be used to achieve the same result. Special use permits shall be required for any use designated as such in Table 3.1-1 (Table of Allowed Uses). 
B.  Relationship to development plan requirements. 
1.  Coordination with review of development plans. A development plan may be submitted concurrently with the application for a special use permit. However, development plans will not be approved until and unless the special use permit is approved by the city council. Approval of the special use permit does not constitute approval of a development plan. 
2.  Lapse and expiration of special use permit. A building permit shall be applied for and secured within two years from the time of granting the special use permit; provided, however, that the city council may authorize an extension of this time upon recommendation by the planning and zoning commission. If no building permit has been applied for within two years of approval, the special use permit and all rights and privileges granted thereunder shall automatically terminate without formal action by the city council or planning and zoning commission. After two years has elapsed, the planning and zoning commission and city council, upon application of the owner, may review the special use permit for continued validity. If the special use permit is not extended, the property owner shall submit a new or revised special use permit application for approval prior to any construction or application for building permit for the area designated for the special use permit. 
C.  Procedure. 
1.  Application. A special use permit application shall contain the information specified in the user's guide and shall be submitted to the director of planning. 
2.  Hearing notice. Notice of hearings shall be published, mailed, and posted following the same procedures associated with rezoning and in accordance with Section 77-803(F). 
3.  Director's review and report. The director of planning or designee shall review each proposed special use permit application in accordance with this section. Upon review, the director shall provide a report to the planning and zoning commission. 
4.  Planning and zoning commission review, hearing, and recommendation. The planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed application and recommend approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the special use permit, based on the criteria of subsection D below. 
5.  City council review, hearing, and decision. The city council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed application and shall, based on the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and the criteria of subsection D below, approve, approve with conditions, or deny the special use permit. The decision by the city council shall be final and binding. 
D.  Approval criteria. Recommendations and decisions on special use permits shall be based on consideration of the following criteria: 
1.  The proposed special use permit is consistent with the comprehensive plan and other infrastructure-related plans, all applicable provisions of this Code, and applicable state and federal regulations; 
2.  The proposed special use permit is consistent with the purpose and intent of the zoning district in which it is located; 
3.  Whether the proposed special use permit meets the challenge of some changing condition, trend, or fact; 
4.  Whether the proposed special use permit will protect or enhance the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public; 
5.  Whether the municipality and other service providers will be able to provide sufficient transportation and utility facilities and services to the subject property, while maintaining sufficient levels of service to existing development; 
6.  Whether the proposed special use permit is consistent with or will have significant adverse impacts on other property in the vicinity of the subject tract; and 
7.  The suitability of the subject property for the existing zoning and the proposed use sought by the special use permit. 
E.  Changes to terms and conditions of approval. Any changes to the terms and conditions of approval of the special use permit that cannot be made using the minor modification process (see section 77-811) shall require separate review and approval by the planning and zoning commission and city council. Any application for approval of such changes shall be filed, processed, reviewed, and approved or denied in the manner set forth in this section for the original application. 
F.  Zoning map. All special use permits approved in accordance with the provisions of this section in its original form, or by subsequent amendments thereto, shall be referenced on the official zoning map, and a list of such special use permits shall be maintained as part of this Code. 
G.  Successive applications. Following denial of a special use permit, no new application for the same or a substantially similar request shall be accepted within one year of the date of denial unless it is determined by the director of planning that substantial changes are proposed that could affect the outcome of the approval. 
H.  Board of adjustment. The board of adjustment shall not have jurisdiction to hear, review, reverse, or modify any decision, determination, or ruling with respect to a special use permit. 
(Ord. No. 019-08, § 1, 7-15-2008; Ord. No. 016-09, § 3, 6-2-2009)

(Ord. No. 002-12, § 3, 1-3-2012) 
CHAPTER 77-300. - USE REGULATIONS 

Sec. 77-301. - Table of allowed uses. 
    Table 3.1-1 below lists the uses allowed within all base zoning districts. Each of the listed uses is defined in Chapter 77-1100, Definitions. 
A.  Explanation of table abbreviations. 
1.  Allowed by-right uses. "A" in a cell indicates that the use is allowed by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this Code, including the use-specific standards set forth in this chapter and the requirements of Chapter 77-500, Development and design standards. 
2.  Special Uses. "S" in a cell indicates that, in the respective zoning district, the use is allowed only if reviewed and approved as a special use permit in accordance with subchapter 77-206(A). 
3.  Prohibited uses. A blank cell indicates that the use is prohibited in the respective zoning district. 
4.  Use-specific standards. Regardless of whether a use is allowed by right or permitted as a special use, there may be additional standards that are applicable to the use. The existence of these use-specific standards is noted through a cross-reference in the last column of the table. Cross-references refer to subchapter 77-302, Use-specific standards. These standards apply in all districts unless otherwise specified. 
B.  Table organization. In Table 3.1-1, land uses and activities are classified into general "use categories" and specific "use types" based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. This classification provides a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. This classification does not list every use or activity that may appropriately exist within the categories and specific uses may be listed in one category when they may reasonably have been listed in one or more other categories. The use categories are intended merely as an indexing tool and are not regulatory. 
C.  Use for other purposes prohibited. Approval of a use listed in Table 3.1-1, and compliance with the applicable use-specific standards for that use, authorizes that use only. Development or use of a property for any other use not specifically allowed in Table 3.1-1 and approved under the appropriate process is prohibited. 
D.  Classification of new and unlisted uses. It is recognized that new types of land use will develop and forms of land use not anticipated may seek to locate in the city. In order to provide for such situations, a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use shall be made. When application is made for a use category or use type that is not specifically listed in Table 3.1-1, the procedure set forth below shall be followed. 
1.  The director of planning shall provide an interpretation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. In making such interpretation, the director shall consider the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity; sales; processing; type of product, storage and amount, and nature thereof; enclosed or open storage; anticipated employment; transportation requirements; the amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material, and vibration likely to be generated; and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer. 
2.  Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted as those of a similar use. 
3.  Appeal of the director's decision shall be made to the board of adjustment following procedures under subchapter 77-813, Appeals of administrative decisions. 
E.  Table of allowed uses.

Sec. 77-302. - Use-specific standards. 
A.  Residential uses. 
1.  Dwelling, HUD-code manufactured home. A new HUD-code manufactured home may be permitted in any residential or agricultural district, provided that the dwelling and lot conform to all applicable construction standards, and zoning standards for the respective zoning district. For purposes of this provision, a "new" manufactured home has never been occupied. 
2.  Dwelling, manufactured housing park. 
(a)  Effective January 1, 2005, no mobile home dwelling, except those already being used as a dwelling, shall be located within the City of Rowlett. 
(b)  Only a HUD-code manufactured home no more than five years old may be located within a manufactured housing or mobile home park, so long as the park has a minimum of seven acres. 
(c)  Masonry construction standards shall not apply to approved manufactured housing within a manufactured housing or mobile home park. 
3.  Dwelling, multi-family. 
(a)  Refuse facilities. 
(1)  Every dwelling unit shall be located within 250 feet of a refuse facility measured along the designated pedestrian or vehicular travel way. There shall be available at all times at least six cubic yards of refuse container per 30 multi-family dwelling units. For complexes with less than 30 units, no less than four cubic yards shall be provided. 
(2)  Each refuse facility shall be enclosed within a building, or shall be screened pursuant to the requirements for screening of dumpsters and trash compactors in subchapter 77-504F.2. 
(3)  Refuse containers shall be provided and maintained in such a manner to satisfy local public health and sanitary regulations. Each refuse facility shall be located so as to provide safe and convenient pickup by refuse collection agencies. 
B.  Institutional and public uses. 
1.  Telecommunication antennas. 
A.  Purpose. These regulations are adopted for the following purposes: 
(1)  To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city. 
(2)  To enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community safely, effectively, and efficiently. 
(3)  To provide regulations for antenna support structures and antennas that provide secure mounting and construction and prevent interference with public safety communications equipment. 
(4)  To encourage the users of support structures and antennas to collocate where possible and to locate all facilities, to the extent possible, in areas where adverse impact on the community is minimal. Stealth designs are required for all antenna support structures, antennas, and supporting equipment. 
(5)  To protect and enhance the city's environmental and aesthetic quality. 
(6)  To identify standards in order to ensure equitable treatment of providers of functionally equivalent telecommunications services. 
B.  Applicability. 
(1)  This article applies to all telecommunications towers, support structures, and antennas installed, built or modified unless exempted in (2) below. 
(2)  Exemptions. 
(a)  In any zoning district, antennas that are two meter or less in diameter including satellite earth stations. 
(b)  In any zoning district, any receive-only antennas and antenna support structures that are owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator where the combined height does not exceed 40 feet provided an amateur radio antenna shall be installed according to manufacturer's requirements and approved by the building official. 
(3)  Support structures or antennas legally installed before adoption of this ordinance are not required to comply with this ordinance but must meet all applicable state and federal requirements, building codes, and safety standards. However, if a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent where the replacement cost is greater than 50 percent of its appraised value at the time of damage or destruction as determined by the latest tax rolls, then such nonconformity shall not be re-established and such structure may only be rebuilt in compliance with the requirements of this Code except upon action by the board of adjustment to permit reconstruction of such structure and continuance of the nonconforming use. The board of adjustment shall have due regard for the rights of the person or persons affected, and shall consider such in regard to public welfare, character of the area surrounding, nature of the use in relation to the intent of the area, and the conservation, preservation and protection of property. In addition, no nonconforming structure shall be enlarged or extended to occupy a greater area than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the regulations that make the structure nonconforming. Any nonconforming use on a lot or portion of a lot may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(4)  An AM array shall be subject to these regulations. An AM array consisting of one or more support structure units and supporting ground equipment, which functions as one AM broadcasting antenna, shall be considered one support structure. Measurements for setbacks and separation distances shall be measured from the outer perimeter of the support structures, including the guide wires, in the array. Additional support structure units may be added within the perimeter of the AM array by right. 
C.  Definitions. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the respective meanings as ascribed to them: 
    Antenna: Any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on or within a support structure, building, or structure and used in communications that radiate or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio frequencies (excluding radar signals), wireless telecommunications signals, television signals, or other communication signals. 
    Antenna support structures: The transmitting or receiving system, its supporting structures, and any appurtenances mounted thereon, including a free-standing structure built specifically to support or act as an antenna or a structure mounted on some other man-made object such as a building or bridge. 
    Backhaul network: The lines that connect a communications provider's support structure/cell sites to one or more telephone switching offices and/or long distance providers, or the public switched telephone network. 
    Collocation: The use of a single-support structure and/or site by more than one communications provider. Collection also means locating a telecommunications facility on an existing structure (for example: buildings, water tanks, towers, utility poles, etc.) without the need to construct a new support structure. 
    The Federal Aviation Administration. 
    The Federal Communications Commission. 
    Height: The distance measured from the finished grade of the parcel to the highest point on the support structure or other structure including the base pad and any antenna. 
    Monopole: A structure composed of a single spire used to support telecommunications equipment. 
    Omni antenna: A thin, vertical, whip-type antenna that delivers an omni directional signal. 
    Pre-existing support structures and pre-existing antennas: Any support structure or antenna for which a building permit or use permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance, including permitted support structures or antennas that have not yet been constructed so long as such approval is current and not expired. 
    Stealth antenna support structure: The design of a tower or tower structure that blends into the surrounding environment and is visually unobtrusive. Examples of a stealth design or tower are: architecturally screened, roof-mounted antenna/array/equipment; building-mounted antenna/array/equipment that is painted and treated as an architectural element to blend with the existing building; designs that conceal the antenna/array/equipment, such as manmade trees, clock towers, bell towers, steeples, light poles, and similar alternative-design mounting structures. 
    Telecommunications facility: Any unmanned facility consisting of equipment for the transmission, switching, and/or receiving of wireless communications. Such facility may be elevated (either structure-mounted or ground-mounted) transmitting and receiving antennas, low-power mobile radio service base station equipment, and interconnection equipment. The categories of facility types include both roof and/or structure-mount facilities and telecommunications support structures. 
    Telecommunication tower: A structure constructed for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas designed to transmit or receive wireless signals (i.e. cellular, radio, or television). 
    Temporary antenna: An antenna and supporting equipment used on a temporary basis in conjunction with a special event, emergency situation, or in case of equipment failure. 
    Transceiver radio: Radio equipment rectangular in shape that attaches to lighting fixtures and/or utility poles and meets wind load requirements. Transceiver radios may have an attached omni-directional whip antenna. 
D.  General requirements. 
(1)  Antennas and support structures may be considered either principal or accessory uses. 
(2)  Antenna installations shall comply with all other requirements of all city ordinances and the zoning ordinance with the exception of those specified within this article. 
(3)  All commercial attachments including but not limited to signs, flags, lights and attachments, other than those required for emergency identification, communications operations, structural stability, or as required for flight visibility by the FAA and FCC shall be prohibited on any antenna or antenna support structure. However, lights may remain or be replaced on light standards that are altered or replaced to serve as antenna support structures with fixtures that comply with the lighting regulations of the city. However, this provision shall not preclude the inclusion of an antenna within or mounted on a flag pole. 
(4)  All antennas and support structures must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other state and federal agency with regulatory authority over support structures and antennas. If standards change, owners must comply within six months or as required by the regulating authority. 
(5)  A building permit is required to erect or install an antenna, antenna support structure, and related equipment, unless the particular antenna is exempt from regulations of this article. All installations must comply with applicable state and local building codes and the standards published by the Electronic Industries Association as may be amended from time to time. In addition to any other approvals required by this section, no new antenna, tower, or support structure shall be erected prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(6)  All support structures and antennas must be constructed and operated in a manner that does not create electromagnetic or other interference with the City of Rowlett's radio frequencies and public safety operations as required by the FCC. 
(7)  No commercial antenna, antenna support structure, microwave reflector/antenna, or associated foundations or support wires may be located within any required front, side, or rear yard setback. 
(8)  All antennas and antenna support structures owned and/or operated by a governmental entity shall be permitted by right in any district. 
(9)  Design. 
(a)  Subject to the requirements of the FAA or any applicable state or federal agency, towers shall be painted a neutral color consistent with the natural or built environment of the site. 
(b)  Stealth structures must be designed so they are reasonably consistent with the surrounding built or natural environment. In order to determine compliance with this requirement, the city will consider the following criteria: 
i.  Scale; 
ii.  Color; 
iii.  The compatibility of the proposed facility with surrounding built and natural features; 
iv.  Extent to which the proposed facility has been designed to reasonably replicate a non-wireless facility; and 
v.  Extent to which the proposed facility is not readily identifiable as a wireless communications facility. 
(c)  Towers shall not exceed the height limitations of any airport overly zone as may be adopted by the city. 
(d)  Antenna attached to a building or stealth support structure shall be of a color identical to or closely compatible with the surface to which they are mounted. 
(e)  All towers and equipment shelters or cabinets shall be surrounded by a minimum 6 foot high decorative wall constructed of (1) brick, stone or other approved materials as listed in this Code or (2) wrought iron fence and a landscape strip of not less than 10 feet in width planted with evergreen materials, which will provide a visual barrier to a minimum height of six feet within two years. The landscape strip shall be exterior to any security wall. In lieu of the required wall and landscape strip, an alternative means of screening may be approved by administrative permit. An acceptable alternative shall be in accordance with living screen requirement of the Code, or by an equivalent method approved by the planning director where visual screening will be achieved that meet the intent of this Code. 
(f)  If the equipment cabinets or storage buildings contain machinery that produces noise, the cabinet, or building shall be designed so that the noise is not perceptible outside the structure." 
(g)  All towers and structures shall be set back from the property line of any adjacent use, and any thoroughfare, collector and above as indicated on the Master Thoroughfare Plan, at least a distance equal to the height of the tower. An exception to this exists where there is provided an engineered break or collapse point of the tower, in which case the setback may be 110 percent of the distance of the breakpoint to the bottom of the tower. The setback shall consider the combined fall distance of the remaining supported base and any collapsed sections so as to prevent encroachment onto adjacent property, public street, overhead utility lines or ground or pad-mounted utility services. 
(h)  Vehicle or outdoor storage on any tower site is prohibited. 
(i)  On-site parking on an approved concrete surface for periodic maintenance and service must be provided at all antenna or tower locations consistent with the underlying zoning district. 
(10)  All antennas and support structures shall be protected from unauthorized access by appropriate security measures. A description of proposed security measures shall be provided as part of any application to install, build, or modify antennas or support structures. Additional measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit and/or conditional use permit as deemed necessary. 
(11)  Temporary antennas shall only be allowed in the following instances: 
(a)  In conjunction with a festival, carnival, or other special event. 
(b)  In case of an emergency as required by the police or fire departments. 
(c)  When needed to restore service on a temporary basis after failure of an antenna installation. The city must be notified within 72 hours of the placement of a temporary antenna. If the temporary antenna is to be needed for more than seven days, then the provider must acquire a permit for the use. 
(12)  Applicants must notify the city of any change in collocation or backhaul providers within 30 days of the exchange. 
(13)  Obsolete non-complying tower structures. Any portion of a tower, which is not occupied by an active antenna for a period of six consecutive months, shall be removed at the owner's expense. Failure to comply with this provision shall constitute a public nuisance that may be remedied by the city at the tower or property owner's expense. Any applicant for a new tower or disguised structure shall place a bond or other security with the city prior to any final approval for the purpose of removing any tower or disguised structure as required herein and to compensate the city for performing proper maintenance of such towers or disguised structures to ensure such structures do not become unsafe or otherwise fail to be maintained in compliance with this Code. The bond or security shall be in the form approved by the planning director, and in the amount of $15,000.00, or such other amount as is determined by the planning director to satisfy the requirements hereof with regard to the specific tower or structure to which it would apply. 
(14)  Wind-load. A tower shall be designed with a minimum 90 mile per hour wind-load. The wind load characteristics of the tower shall consider the addition of up to two antennas. 
E.  Collocation. Collocation shall be accomplished as follows: 
(1)  All new stealth support structures over 60 feet in height must be constructed to support antennas for at least two carriers unless the support structure is replacing an existing utility structure or light standard. Sufficient area for associated structures and equipment must also be provided. A written agreement committing to shared use as required by this subsection shall be submitted by the tower applicant prior to approval of the application. The failure of the owner of a tower built for shared use shall be in violation of this ordinance and, among other remedies of the city, shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same owner to install, build or modify antennae or towers within the city. 
(2)  Telecommunications area map. Any tower approved within the city or ETJ, indicated within that jurisdiction on the telecommunications area map, shall be designed and constructed to accommodate the number of users indicated on the map to the extent feasible. The failure of the owner of the tower built for shared users to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be a violation of this Code and, among other remedies of the city, shall be cause for the withholding or revocation of a conditional use permit. 
(3)  Appeal of shared use violations. Any party seeking shared use of a tower subject to this provision shall, after responding to notice of an application, negotiate with the tower owner for such use. The tower owner may, on a legitimate and reasonable business basis, choose between multiple requests for shared use on the same tower or structure, and may reject any request where legitimate technical obstacles cannot be reasonable overcome or where the party requesting shared use will not agree to reasonable financial terms. Any party believing that the applicant has breached its duty to negotiate in good faith for shared use shall notify the applicant and the planning director in writing within 20 days. The planning director may reject the application upon a finding that shared use has been improperly denied. A notice of breach of duty shall explain the precise basis for the claim and shall be accompanied by payment of an administrative review fee as established by resolution of the city council. After the tower owner's receipt of the notice, the tower owner shall have 20 days to provide a written submission to the planning director responding to the alleged violation of the shared use requirement. If deemed necessary by the planning director, he/she may engage, at the cost of the party alleging the violation, a neutral, qualified technical consultant to provide an opinion on feasibility or costs of the shared use request. If the planning director receives a notice alleging a violation of the shared use requirement, the time for a decision on an administrative permit is automatically extended until the planning director has determined that the tower owner has complied. 
(4)  A support structure which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate collocation shall be of the same type or design as the existing structure and is subject to the following regulations: 
(a)  The support structure may be modified or rebuilt to a height not to exceed 30 feet over the support structure's existing height, with a maximum height of 150 feet above ground level (AGL).

Sec. 77-304. - Temporary uses and structures. 
A.  Purpose. This section allows for the establishment of specifically enumerated uses for a temporary period when such activities are desirable for the community in the short term but may have detrimental effects if allowed to continue on a long term basis, provided that (1) a temporary use permit is properly obtained pursuant to [section] 77-810 of this Code; (2) the proposed temporary use complies with the requirements of this section. 
B.  Permitted temporary uses and structures. The following temporary uses and structures may be permitted in accordance with the requirements of this section: 
1.  Temporary expansion or replacement facilities. Expansion or replacement facilities, consisting of transportable buildings that are pre-constructed and arrive at the site ready for occupancy and are readily removed and installed at other sites, may be permitted in accordance with the requirements herein. Such facilities may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(a)  Religious assembly facilities, health care facilities, entertainment uses, and government offices, following the approval of filed plans and applications for the permanent alteration/expansion of these facilities, if required.

2.  Temporary parking areas. 
(a)  Temporary parking areas located within projected rights-of-way. Parking required by this Code may be provided temporarily within a setback area required under this Code if approved in accordance with the site plan. 
(b)  Temporary parking on unimproved surfaces. Temporary parking on unimproved surfaces such as dirt and gravel may be approved in conjunction with events provided the grass is maintained and kept short to reduce the risk of fire. 
3.  Real estate sales offices and model homes. 
(a)  A non-transportable real estate sales office is allowed for residential development in any residential zoning district until all lots or houses are sold. 
(b)  A transportable sales office may be used for a period of six months, or until the first six lots or ten percent of the lots, whichever is less, are sold. 
4.  Temporary semitrailer, wheeled vehicle, or containerized freight container. 
(a)  A temporary semitrailer, wheeled vehicle, or containerized freight container may be approved for 60 days where used for temporary storage of seasonal merchandise for a continuous period one time per year for a retail use exceeding 50,000 square feet. 
(b)  A temporary semitrailer, wheeled vehicle, or containerized freight container may be approved for the duration of a project where used as a construction office or for construction equipment storage for an ongoing commercial or utility construction project. 
5.  Seasonal uses. Seasonal uses, including but not limited to, Christmas tree sales and pumpkin sales, may be approved for up to 45 days. 
6.  Similar temporary uses. Similar temporary uses which, in the opinion of the planning director, are compatible with the zoning district and surrounding land uses, and meet the general requirements of this section may be approved for up to 30 days.

Sec. 77-402. - General measurement rules and exceptions. 
A.  Lot size and density requirements. 
1.  Minimum lot dimensions. Any lot that is created, developed, used, or occupied shall meet the minimum lot area, width, depth, and coverage requirements set forth in Tables 4.1-1, 4.1-2, and 4.1-3 for the zoning district in which it is located, except as otherwise established in this Code for particular uses. New lots shall also meet the development standards set forth in [subchapter] 77-603F, Lots. 
2.  Number of principal buildings or uses per lot. 
(a)  Only one main building for single-family, two-family, or multiple-family use, with permitted accessory buildings, may be located upon a lot or unplatted tract. Every dwelling shall face or front upon a street or officially approved place, other than an alley, with means of access having a minimum width at the building line of 50 feet and a minimum street frontage of 35 feet. 
(b)  Where a lot or tract of land is used for local retail or manufacturing purposes, more than one main building may be located upon the lot but only when such buildings conform to all requirements of this Code applicable to the uses and district, and when all main buildings face upon a street or otherwise approved place. 
3.  Setback requirements. 
(a)  Required setbacks. 
(1)  A building, structure, or lot shall not be developed, used, or occupied unless it meets the minimum setback requirements set forth in Tables 4.1-1, 4.1-2, and 4.1-3 for the zoning district in which it is located, except as otherwise established in this Code for particular uses or unless a variance has been granted. 
(2)  Setbacks shall be unoccupied and unobstructed by any structure or portion of a structure from 30 inches above grade upward; provided, however, that fences, walls, trellises, poles, posts, ornaments, furniture, and other customary yard accessories may be permitted in any setback subject to height limitations and requirements limiting obstruction of visibility. 
(3)  A setback or other open space required by this Code shall not be included as part of a setback or other open space required by this Code for another building or structure or lot. 
(b)  Measurement of front setbacks. 
(1)  In the case of rounded property corners at street intersections, the front setback is measured as if the corner is not rounded and the front property lines are extrapolated to intersect. 
(2)  For cul-de-sac lots and lots abutting a curved street, the front setback follows the curve of the front property line. 
(3)  In the case of flag lots, a front setback extends across the entire flag portion of the lot and does not include the flagpole portion of the lot. 
(4)  In the case of corner, through, and three-sided lots, there will be no rear setbacks, but only front and side setbacks. 
(c)  Projections into required setbacks. The following structures may project into required front, side, or rear setbacks as specified in this subsection, and shall not be considered in determining lot coverage: 
(1)  Open porches of dwellings may extend into the front setback a distance of ten feet from the building line. 
(2)  Windowsills, fireplace chases, belt courses, cornices, eaves and similar incidental architectural features may project not more than four feet into any required setback. 
(3)  Paved terraces may project into required front, side, or rear setbacks, provided that no structures placed there shall violate other requirements of this Code. 
(4)  Unroofed landings, decks, and stairs may project into required front and rear setbacks only, provided that no portion other than a handrail shall extend higher than 30 inches above the landing, deck, or stairs. 
(5)  The director may allow the installation of temporary handicap access ramps in required front, side, and rear setbacks. Ramps shall not remain installed for longer than one year from the date the building or land use permit is granted. The design and placement of the ramps shall be reviewed to insure that: 
a.  The ramp has minimal visual impact on abutting properties; and 
b.  The ramp is architecturally compatible with the structure in design and bulk, and 
c.  The width of the ramp does not exceed 48 inches, and 
d.  That no portion of the ramp, other than a handrail, shall extend higher than 30 inches above the ramp. 
(6)  Bay windows may project no more than two feet into any required yard setback. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, bay windows shall not be included in determining lot coverage. 
(d)  Dwellings must front on streets; exception. No residential dwelling shall be erected on a lot that does not abut on at least one street, at least 50 feet in width (at building line), for at least 35 feet. An exception to this provision exists where a paved mutual access easement of at least 35 feet in width is provided and recorded for record. 
(e)  Corner lots with two frontages. In the case of corner lots, unless otherwise specified in Tables 4.1-1 through 4.1-3, a front setback of the required depth (the "primary front setback") shall be provided in accordance with the prevailing setback pattern and a second front setback of half the depth required generally for front setbacks in the district (the "secondary front setback") shall be provided on the other frontage. The interior side yard of a corner lot shall be the same as for dwellings and accessory buildings on an interior lot. Where the corner lot is a key lot, the required front yard shall be provided on both streets. 
(f)  Double-frontage lots. In the case of double-frontage lots, unless the prevailing front setback pattern on adjoining lots indicates otherwise, front setbacks shall be provided on all frontages. Where one of the front setbacks that would normally be required on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing setback pattern, the administrative official may waive the requirement for the normal front setback and substitute therefore a special front setback requirement, which shall not exceed the average of the setbacks provided on adjacent lots. 
(g)  Vision clearance. On any corner lot on which a front and side yard are required, no wall, fence, structure, sign, or any plant growth that obstructs sight lines at elevations between 2.5 feet and six feet above any portion of the crown of the adjacent roadway shall be maintained in a triangle formed by measuring from the point of intersection of the front and exterior side lot lines a distance of 25 feet along the front and side lot lines and connecting the points so established to form a right triangle on the area of the lot adjacent to the street intersection. 
(h)  Setbacks adjacent to certain transportation corridors. If adjacent to the PGB Turnpike, Lakeview Parkway/SH 66, or Interstate 30, additional setbacks may be required based on the setbacks of adjacent land uses or adjacent platted properties. If no established front or exterior side setback exists, front and exterior side setbacks shall be 50 feet. The front and exterior side setback areas shall be landscaped so as to provide the heaviest vegetation cover, using combinations of canopy and understory trees and shrubs to the extent that such landscaping will enhance the architectural features of the building. 
(i)  Residential setbacks adjacent to railroads. 
(1)  In any district zoned for single-family residential or two-family residential development that is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, there shall be a required 100-foot setback buffer between the railroad right-of-way edge and the closest portion of the main building. This buffer is to minimize intrusion on adjacent residential uses, including noise, vibration, and air pollution. 
(2)  A heavily landscaped line of shrubs or trees is recommended along the residential property that abuts the railroad right-of-way. 
(3)  Subsection (h) shall not apply to residential uses within the downtown area, as indicated on the official zoning map, as amended, that conform to plans for the downtown area. 
B.  Height requirements. 
1.  Increase in height based on larger setbacks. Buildings may exceed the height limitation of the district if the minimum depth of rear yards and the minimum width of the side yards required in the district are increased one foot for each two feet by which the height of such structure exceeds the prescribed height limit. 
2.  Height exceptions for appurtenances. Except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Code, the height limitations contained in this Code do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, flagpoles, chimneys, antennas, heating and ventilation equipment, elevator housings, stairwell towers or similar appurtenances; provided, however, the following: 
(a)  The appurtenance does not interfere with Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace; 
(b)  The appurtenance does not extend more than 25 feet above the maximum permitted building height, except as allowed herein; 
(c)  The appurtenance is not constructed for the purpose of providing additional floor area in the building; 
(d)  The appurtenance complies with the screening requirements for mechanical equipment and appurtenances in section 77-507.

(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-502. - Protection of drainage areas and creeks; stormwater management. 
A.  Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to protect creeks and drainage areas, to ensure adequate stormwater drainage and flood control within the city, to protect public health and safety, to minimize property damage due to flooding, to limit runoff rates to equitably distribute the cost of necessary drainage improvements, and to minimize the maintenance cost of drainage facilities constructed. Any development or improvement of property affecting storm drainage and flood control in the city is subject to the provisions of this chapter and other applicable requirements of this Code, pertaining to floods. It also applies to individual building structures, subdivisions, excavation and fill operations. 
B.  Protection of drainage and creek areas. 
1.  Definitions and methodology for determining floodway management area (FMA). The definitions for the terms "floodway" and "floodway fringe" shall correspond to those set forth by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the concept of a floodway is used as a tool to assist the local community in floodplain management. Under this concept, the area of the 100-year floodplain is divided into a floodway and floodway fringe or flood fringe. The floodway is the channel of a stream plus any area that is part of the channel or stream that includes moving water and as determined on the latest Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The area between the floodway and boundary of the 100-year flood is termed the flood fringe. The flood fringe, or 100-year flood plain, is an area that, in any given year, has a one-percent chance of flooding, and is the area that may be considered for development based on established city engineer criteria. For the purposes of this division, the floodway management area (FMA) will correspond to the floodway as defined by FEMA. 
2.  Areas where FMA is required. All special flood hazard areas, as referenced by the currently effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), shall be included in the FMA. If FEMA does not specify a floodway zone in any of the flood hazard areas, it shall be the developer's responsibility to establish and identify the FMA. The determination shall be made by a state-registered professional engineer and in accordance with the Drainage and Stormwater Control Ordinance, as amended, and approved by the city engineer and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Where improvements to a drainage area are required by other ordinances of the city for the purpose of public health, safety, or welfare, those ordinances shall take precedence. The FMA is intended to apply to a creek or channel, which is to remain open, or in its natural condition unless improvements are required by the city due to the pending development of properties adjacent to or upstream of the required improvements. No construction shall occur within a FMA without an approved flood plain permit. 
3.  Ownership and maintenance of FMA. The areas determined to be FMA shall be designated on and as part of the preliminary and final plan or plat. At the discretion of the city, any portion of the FMA may be accepted for dedication and designated as a park or for other public use. The FMA shall not qualify as required park dedication unless recommended by the park board and approved by the city council. 
4.  Design criteria. The following design criteria shall be required for development adjacent to the FMA: 
(a)  Adequate access must be provided along the FMA for public or private maintenance. 
(b)  If lots back onto an FMA, at least two reasonable points of access to the FMA, each a minimum of 20 feet in width, shall be provided. Streets and alleys may qualify as access points. All areas of the FMA must be accessible from the access points. 
(c)  No open detention facility shall be located adjacent to a public street. To the greatest extent practical, detention facilities shall be located underground, and the site designed in such a way as to maximize the surface area for parking. 
5.  Exemptions. Drainage areas that have been altered and are not in a natural condition may be exempted from FMA requirements herein at the discretion of the city council upon recommendation of the city engineer. 
C.  General requirements for stormwater management. 
1.  Generally. 
i.  The construction of all improvements shall be in accordance with the standards and requirements of this Chapter 77-502C., and the standards set forth in the current paving and drainage specifications and details. 
ii.  The frequency chart in years (Figure 1 from the Handbook), the inlet capacity for low point inlets (Figure 2), the drainage capacity road sections (Figure 3), and the city criteria are hereby adopted as a part of this section. 
iii.  Complete engineering plans for storm drainage facilities shall be prepared by a professional engineer registered in the state and experienced in civil engineering work. The total cost for such engineering plans and specifications shall be borne by the owner or the developer and shall be furnished to the city engineer for his review and approval. 
iv.  In any development, alteration, or improvement of property, the owner may be required to provide, at his expense, a preliminary drainage study for the total area to be ultimately developed. This study shall be submitted to the city engineer as a part of the submitted data for consideration of preliminary plat, or site plan approval. 
v.  Storm water detention facilities shall not be located within the front or exterior side yard unless an underground detention facility is proposed. 
2.  Storm sewer inlets. Storm sewer inlets shall be provided along paved streets at such intervals as are necessary to limit the depth of flow as follows: 
(a)  Residential streets. Based on parkway slopes of one-fourth of an inch per foot behind the curb, the 100-year design frequency flows shall not exceed a depth of one and one-half inches over the top of the curb. A maximum flow of 45 cfs will be allowed in the street. 
(b)  Collector streets. Based on parkway slopes of one-fourth of an inch per foot behind the curb, in industrial and commercial areas, the 100-year design frequency flows shall not exceed a depth of one-half of an inch over the top of the curb. A maximum flow of 45 cfs will be allowed in the street. 
(c)  Major thoroughfares. Based on a transverse slope of one-fourth of an inch per foot on the pavement, the 100-year design frequency flow shall not exceed the elevation of the lowest top of the curb. A maximum of 45 cfs will be allowed in the street. 
(d)  Alleys. The 100-year design frequency flows shall not exceed the capacity of the alley sections. A maximum of 45 cfs will be allowed for an alley with curbs, and 25 cfs for alleys without curbs. 
(e)  Positive overflow. The approved drainage system shall provide for positive overflow at all low points. The term "positive overflow" means that when the inlets do not function properly, or when the design capacity of the conduit is exceeded, the excess flow can be conveyed over land along a paved course. Normally, this would mean along a street or alley, but can require the dedications of special drainage easements on private property. 
3.  Closed storm sewer system design velocities. A closed storm sewer system shall be required to accommodate a runoff exceeding the street capacity, as provided in this section, up to and including the design capacity of a 72-inch concrete pipe. The following are recommended maximum design velocities: 
i.  Culverts: 15 feet per second (fps). 
ii.  Inlet laterals: 10 fps. 
iii.  Storm sewers: 12.5 fps. 
Discharge velocities cannot exceed the permitted velocity of the channel or conduit at the outfall. 
4.  Open channels. An open channel may be permitted to accommodate runoff exceeding the design capacity of a 72-inch pipe, as provided in the following: 
(a)  Channels draining an area with a "CA" factor (coefficient to runoff and drainage area, as used in the "rational formula") of less than 600 shall be concrete-lined to the design depth, plus six-inch freeboard, except that a closed system as set forth in subsection 3.c. of this section may be used. 
(b)  Channels draining an area with a "CA" factor between 600 and 1,000 shall be improved to a capacity of the 100-year design discharge by excavation, straightening and realignment. The construction of a concrete-lined channel shall have a width of not less than the bottom width with concrete lined to a depth of at least three feet on the banks. Earthen side slopes shall be no steeper than four to one, horizontal to vertical, and shall have approved ground cover to prevent erosion. Where drainage conditions or velocities of water will exceed that condition which would create erosion, provisions shall be made for the placement of riprap, gabion, etc., along the stream and channel banks by the developer. 
(c)  Channels draining an area with a "CA" factor over 1,000 shall be designed to carry the capacity of a 100-year flood frequency storm. The specific design and type of construction improvements for this drainage facility shall have specific approval by the city engineer after review of the maintenance, erosion, and site conditions. 
(d)  All areas of an earth channel section shall be improved by the developer with low-maintenance vegetation as approved by the city engineer, prior to planting. The selection of materials shall comply with the current ground cover listing for North Central Texas furnished through the state agricultural extension service. 
(e)  The setback for the building line shall be as follows: 
(1)  A 20-foot wide access easement shall be provided along at least one side parallel to the channel. The top width of the channel at the design depth must not exceed 50 feet unless specifically approved by the city engineer and shown on the file plans. 
(2)  A drainage flume section which provides for limited flow of stormwater shall be located within a drainage easement of sufficient width which permits future maintenance accessibility. 
5.  Natural drainage features. A drainage feature which is to remain in its natural state of native growth may be accepted by the city to remain as an unimproved facility so long as the water conveyance capacity of the area is adequate to handle the future and/or planned drainage requirements. 
6.  Dedication of floodway land in lieu of a channel or canal. In lieu of the improvements of a channel or canal draining an area with a "CA" factor in excess of 600, the city council may elect to accept the dedication of all land within the 100-year floodway of the existing drainage channel as a permanent drainage right-of-way. 
7.  Applicability of section provisions to publicly owned land. The criteria for drainage improvements as set forth in subsection C.2. through 5. of this section shall be applicable to publicly owned lands at the discretion of the city. 
8.  Excavation, fill, and grading operations; permit required. Excavation, fill, and grading operations within the city limits shall be undertaken only after a proper permit has been obtained from the city engineer. Failure to obtain the proper permit may result in the requirement for the developer to replace the soils, as required by the city engineer. 
9.  Easements. Drainage and floodway easements shall be provided for all open channels. Easements shall encompass all areas beneath a ground elevation defined as being the highest elevation of the following: 
(a)  One foot above a design storm having a recurrence interval of 100 years, calculated by the city's criteria. 
(b)  The top of the high bank. 
(c)  Maintenance access. 
D.  Responsibility of owner or developer for storm drainage. 
1.  The owner or developer of property to be developed shall be responsible for all storm drainage flowing through or abutting such property. This responsibility includes the drainage directed to that property by ultimate development as well as the drainage naturally flowing through the property by reason of topography. It is the intent of this section that provision be made for storm drainage in accordance with subchapter 77-502C at such time as any property affected is proposed for development. 
2.  Where the improvement or construction of a storm drainage facility is required along a property line common to two or more owners, the owner hereafter proposing development of his property shall be responsible for the required improvements at the time of development, including the dedication of all necessary right-of-way or easements, to accommodate the improvements. 
3.  Where a property owner proposed development or use of only a portion of his property, provision for storm drainage in accordance with subchapter 77-502C shall only be required in that portion of the property proposed for immediate development, except as construction or improvements of a drainage facility outside that designated portion of the property is deemed essential to the development of that designated portion. 
4.  When a property owner proposes a development, provisions shall be made in the development plan for control of excess siltation and downstream erosion. An erosion control plan shall be approved by the city engineer. 
5.  The owner shall dedicate to the city the required drainage easements. Determination of the minimum easement required shall be made by the city engineer, or as outlined in subchapter 77-502C. 
6.  If a property owner or developer desires to modify an existing pond or lake or desires to impound stormwater by excavation, filling or construction of a dam within a property, for retention or detention, thereby creating a lake, pond, or lagoon or basin as a part of the planned development of that property, the standard provisions for storm drainage as established in subchapter 77-502C shall be applicable, and shall also provide: 
(a)  An engineering plan for such construction, accompanied by complete drainage design information, prepared by a registered professional engineer, shall have been approved by the city. 
(b)  The owner or developer shall have agreed to retain under private ownership the lake, pond, or lagoon or basin constructed, and to assume full responsibility for the protection of the general public from any health or safety hazards related to the lake, pond, or lagoon constructed. 
(c)  The owner or developer shall have agreed to assume full responsibility for the maintenance of the lake, pond, or lagoon or basin constructed. 
(d)  The obligations in this section shall run with the land and shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of such land. 
(e)  All federal, state, and county laws pertaining to impoundment of surface water are complied with, including the design construction and safety of the impounding structure. Any existing structure which is included in a project development area shall be improved to comply with the applicable federal, state, and county and city safety requirements for structures. The design flows shall be based upon the urbanized drainage flows which can result from a 100-year flood. All improvements shall be made to the dam structure at the expense of the developer, prior to acceptance of the adjacent street, utilities and drainage improvements as required in this Code. 
(f)  On any existing structure, the owner will furnish a study by a professional engineer to the city for approval prior to any proposed alteration. Compensatory storage shall be provided in some manner such that equal or comparable flood retention capacity is maintained. 
7.  The maintenance of private drainage facilities shall be provided for by the property owner or assigned agent. The city shall be kept advised of the responsible agent. 
8.  All existing water seepage springs, or flowing water shall be connected into an underground storm sewer system, of they shall be discharged into an appropriate facility which is intended to carry stormwater runoff. Such flow will not be permitted to discharge directly into the street gutter line. 
9.  Fences and screening shall be constructed such that blockage of surface water flow does not occur. This includes the requirement that erosive conditions shall not be created around, under or near a fence structure. 
10.  The developer shall provide detail off-site drainage plans for the proper transition to natural ground or stream elevations. Criteria for on-site development shall apply to off-site improvements as required by the city engineer. 
11.  Detention is not required on subdivisions of one acre or less provided it does not adversely affect adjoining property or public health, safety and welfare as determined by the city engineer. 
_____
E.  Engineering design. 
1.  Each storm drainage facility, including street capacities, shall be designed to convey the runoff which results from a certain prescribed design storm. Drainage design requirements for open and closed systems shall provide protection for property during a storm having a 100-year recurrence interval with this projected flow carried in the streets and closed drainage systems in accordance with the following: 
TABLE 5.2-1: DRAINAGE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS Drainage Facility Design Recurrence Interval Closed storm sewer systems 10-year with emergency 100-year overflow Closed storm sewer systems at street low point or sag 25-year with emergency 100-year overflow Culverts and bridges 100-year (unless otherwise directed) Concrete lined channels 50-year with emergency 100-year overflow Earthen channels 100-year  
2.  Computation of stormwater runoff for drainage areas less than 200 acres shall be by the rational method, which is based on the principle that a maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge. The formula for calculation of runoff by the rational method is: 
TABLE 5.2-2: CALCULATION OF RUNOFF BY RATIONAL METHOD Q = CIA, where Q = The maximum rate of discharge expressed in cubic feet per second C = A runoff coefficient which varies with the topography, soil, soil cover, land use and moisture content of the soil at the time the runoff producing rainfall occurs. This runoff coefficient shall be based on the ultimate use of the land as recommended by the land use plan for the city, and shall be selected from Table 1 of this chapter on the basis of the use shown on land use and zoning map of the comprehensive zoning ordinance for the city. If an area has had a change of zoning to give the area land use for which the "C" in Table I is higher than use shown on land use and zoning maps, the higher "C" factor shall be used. I = Rainfall intensity in inches per hour from the applicable curves of Figure 1. Time of concentration or duration of rainfall for use in Figure 1 shall be calculated by velocity data shown in Table II. A = The drainage area, expressed in acres, contributing to the runoff at the point in question. Calculation of the drainage area shall be made from an accurate topographic map, a copy of which shall be submitted with the engineering plans for approval  
For drainage areas in excess of 200 acres, where the use of "rational method" does not provide reliable data, the use of unit hydrograph flow determination shall be made. The use of a unit hydrograph calculation will be based upon standard and accepted engineering principles normally used in the professional subject to the approval of the city engineer. The Soil Conservation Service Technical Release No. 55 is an acceptable method. Computation of runoff shall be based on a fully developed drainage area, or watershed, in accordance with the land use projected in the then current comprehensive land use plan for the city. The developer or builder shall develop their site development plans so that the rate of runoff created by the development of their property does not exceed the rate of runoff resulting from that which presently exists. The runoff rate which will exit the project shall not be greater than that volume or velocity determined through the defined design criteria, as outlined in this chapter. When development can, or does provide direct drainage outlet works into Lake Ray Hubbard, consideration will be given to allow the design of storm runoff without detention or retention within the project limits. 
3.  The two basic methods suggested for predicting the volume of runoff with time and the peak flow rate are the rational method and the unit hydrograph method. The rational method may be used for drainage areas less than or equal to 200 acres. Drainage basins that exceed 200 acres must use the unit hydrograph method. The Soil Conservation Service Technical Release No. 55 is an acceptable unit hydrograph method. When the rational method is used and detention is required, the volume of water supplied by the design storm may be calculated by converting the runoff rate, during a specific duration, to volume. The inflow volume should be determined for a period of at least twice the time concentration for the site. Retention and detention are two generalized types of storm runoff storage used to control the rate of runoff. All detention ponds should be designed to empty within a 24-hour period.

The data shown in Table 5.2-4 are average velocity of the runoff for calculating time of concentration or duration of rainfall for use in Table 5.2-2. These average velocities in this table shall be used unless the designer shows calculation of velocities by streets and/or storm sewers, or overland flows. Using the average velocities from this table, the designer shall calculate the time of concentration by the following formula unless more data is shown on the plans for calculating time of concentration. "Inlet time" = five minutes for property zoned for multiple-family, local business, central business, commercial or industrial; ten minutes for property zoned for parks, schools, single-family residential and duplex. 
T = "Inlet Time" + D / V x 60 Where: T = Time of concentration in minutes for use in Figure 1. D = Distance in feet from point of concentration to upper end of drainage area under consideration. V = Velocity in feet per second from this table or velocity calculated by designer by streets and/or storm sewers.  
The existing soils are such that erosive conditions are created at certain velocities. The following velocities are considered to be maximum acceptable design conditions:

4.  The minimum curb inlet size shall be ten feet in length with a capacity of eight cfs. 
F.  Construction in areas subject to flooding. 
1.  In all areas subject to flooding, the finished floor elevation shall be a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation as determined by the FIRM as published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or, in absence of such, as calculated for the runoff from a rainfall event having a recurrence interval of 100 years, in a completely developed watershed. The owner/developer shall furnish, at his expense, to the city engineer, sufficient engineering information to confirm that the minimum floor elevations proposed are as required by this subsection. Permits for new residential construction will not be issued until structures are elevated in accordance with requirements adopted by the city. 
2.  No structure, excavation, filling, or construction shall be permitted within a floodplain unless an engineering design is furnished to the city engineer confirming that such will not increase the base flood elevation within that floodplain. 
3.  The provisions of the city's current flood hazard prevention ordinance (F.I.M.A. criteria) shall be observed in preparing land development plans. 
4.  New construction and any addition to any structure shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation, plus two feet, unless acceptable flood-proofing is designed into the construction. 
G.  Minimum lot and floor elevations. Minimum lot and floor elevations shall be established as follows: 
1.  Lots abutting a natural or excavated channel shall have a minimum elevation for the buildable area of the lot at least equal to the highest elevation of the drainage floodway easement, and a finished floor elevation at least two feet above the 100-year design storm or FIRM floodway elevation, whichever is greater. The minimum finished floor elevation shall be set at an elevation of two feet above the top of curb elevation, except when the terrain feature slopes, such that drainage is not a critical element to the project. 
2.  Where lots do not abut a natural or excavated channel, minimum floor elevations shall be a minimum of one foot above the street curb or edge of alley, whichever is lower, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Where a lot is adjacent to a drainage flume or channel, the finished floor shall be a minimum of two feet above the high water elevation. Where the structure is below a street or alley, the builder shall grade and construct facilities such that a positive drainage system of swales are capable of discharging the resultant flows which may flow across the yard area into the structure. 
3.  The minimum finished floor elevation shall be shown on the final file plat for record purposes. Prior to final acceptance of utilities and street construction by the city, a certified statement shall be prepared by a registered public surveyor showing all lot elevations, as developed within the subject project, meet or exceed the required minimum finished floor elevations. This certification shall be filed with the city engineer. 
4.  Existing platted property which is subject to flooding or carries a specified or recorded minimum finished floor elevation shall be surveyed by a registered public surveyor prior to obtaining a building permit. The certified survey data shall be furnished to the city engineer for approval. A certificate of compliance with the provisions of this chapter pertaining to specified finished floor levels shall be required. 
H.  Building permits; plat and site plan approval to be with held. No building permit shall be issued, nor plat or site plan approval, nor certificate of occupancy approved for any construction, reconstruction, or development upon any land where such construction, reconstruction, or development is not in conformity with the requirements and intent of this section. Anyone who violates any of the terms and provisions of this section shall be denied a building permit until the violation is corrected. Residential construction permits will not be issued until lots and/or sites are elevated from the floodplain by F.E.M.A. approved revisions. 
I.  Maintenance guarantee. 
(1)  The contractor shall guarantee the work which he does against defective workmanship and materials for a period of two years from the date of final acceptance by the city. 
(2)  Where defective workmanship and/or materials are discovered requiring repairs to be made under this guarantee, all such repair work shall be done by the contractor at his own expense within five days after written notice of such defect has been given to him by the city. Should the contractor fail to make repair or correct such defective workmanship and/or materials within five days after being notified, the city may make the necessary repairs and charge the contractor with the actual cost of all labor and materials required. 
(3)  The contractor shall provide a maintenance bond for a two-year period after the date of acceptance of the work to cover his guarantee as set forth in this section. The maintenance bond shall be valued at 20 percent of the construction costs of the improvements. 
(4)  Perpetual maintenance shall be by the homeowner's association or property owner.

Sec. 77-503. - Open space. 
A.  Purpose. This section is intended to ensure that open space and natural areas throughout the city are considered and protected during the development review process. Open space serves numerous purposes, including preservation of natural areas and resources, preservation of scenic views, greater resident access to open areas and recreation, public health benefits, and enhancement of the quality of new development in the city. 
B.  Public open space dedication. 
1.  Purpose. This Chapter 77-505.3.B [77-503B] is intended to provide land or fees in-lieu of land for park, trail, and open space demand generated by new residential subdivisions. In general, these lands shall be suitable for the development of active play areas, passive open areas, trails, or in some instances to preserve unique landforms or natural areas. Where no suitable land is available, based on subchapter 77-503B.4 below, Characteristics of park land to be dedicated, fees in-lieu of land or the equivalent monetary value may be substituted at the city's discretion. 
2.  Applicability. If a preliminary or final plat for development of any area zoned and proposed to be used for single-family, duplex, or multifamily residential purposes in the city is presented for approval, such shall be required to dedicate lands for public use if identified in the parks and open space master plan, as amended. 
3.  Amount of park land to be dedicated. The amount of park land to be dedicated shall be determined based upon an individualized finding by the director of parks and recreation that the land being dedicated is reasonably related to the impacts upon the city's parks and recreation system that will be generated by the residents and users of the subject development. In making such a determination, the director of parks and recreation shall find that the park improvements will benefit the development being proposed, based upon a clearly defined nexus, and have been identified in the parks and open space master plan. The amount of land to be dedicated shall be approved by the city council. 
4.  Characteristics of park land to be dedicated. Except as otherwise required by the planning and zoning commission at the time of preliminary plat approval, all dedications of land under this section shall meet the following criteria. These criteria should be considered general guidelines to ensure that the dedication of land is suitable for open space or park development. 
(a)  Location. 
(1)  All parkland offered for dedication under this section shall meet the requirements for location outlined in the parks and recreation master plan. Areas of unusual topography or slope shall be considered by the planning and zoning commission. The dedicated park land shall be located so as to reasonably serve the recreation and open space needs of residents of the subdivision and to comply with the Comprehensive Plan. The dedicated park land may be located outside of the residential development in order to comply with the parks and recreation master plan to add property to existing park land, or to combine land dedication efforts with those of other developments. 
(2)  The director of parks and recreation shall make a recommendation to the planning and zoning commission on the suitability of any proposed park land dedication and the compatibility of the proposed dedication to the parks and open space master plan. 
(3)  To the maximum extent feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets exist on a property, the subdivider, developer, or owner shall give priority to their preservation through public land dedication. In reviewing the proposed location of public land dedication areas, the director of parks and recreation shall make a recommendation to the planning and zoning commission and shall use all applicable plans, maps, and reports to determine whether significant resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected, with priority being given to the following areas (which are not listed in a particular order): 
i.  Wetlands; 
ii.  Flood hazard areas; 
iii.  Lakes, rivers, stream/riparian corridors, and drainageways; 
iv.  Wildlife habitat and migration corridors; and 
v.  Tree preservation areas. 
(4)  The dedicated park land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the director of parks and recreation determines that two or more parcels would be in the best interest of the public, given the type and distribution of open spaces needed to adequately serve the proposed development. In such cases, the planning and zoning commission may require that such parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least 30 feet in width. 
(b)  Usability. The dedicated land required hereby shall be suitable for passive, active, or recreational open space. 
(c)  Access. Unless the land being dedicated is a sensitive environmental area to which access should be restricted for preservation purposes, public access to dedicated park land shall be provided either by adjoining public street frontage or, if required by the director of planning and director of parks and recreation, by a dedicated public easement, at least 30 feet wide, which connects the dedicated land to a public street or right-of-way. Gradients adjacent to existing and proposed streets shall allow for reasonable access to the dedicated land. Public access to greenway/greenbelt dedications only shall be at least 20 feet wide. 
(d)  Areas not eligible. Lands within the following areas shall not be accepted for public/open space dedication: 
i.  Private yards; 
ii.  Public or private streets or rights of way; 
iii.  Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings; and 
iv.  Land covered by structures not intended solely for recreational uses. 
(e)  Public parks. The location and size of public parks within the city shall be determined by the parks and recreation master plan. Parks shall have a minimum area and function as described in the parks and recreation master plan. 
(f)  Procedure for dedication of park land. The dedication of such land shall be reviewed and approved as part of the preliminary and final plat. The subdivider shall designate on the preliminary and final plat the area or areas of land to be dedicated pursuant to this section. Where wetlands exist on a property, as certified by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the preliminary and final plat shall also identify the boundaries of such wetlands. The director of parks and recreation shall be required, by his signature, to accept any lands for park or recreation use. The director of parks and recreation shall refer the dedication to the city council. 
(g)  Submission of deed and survey. Unless otherwise stipulated in a subdivision agreement, the conveyance of dedicated land to the city shall be by warranty deed, and the title shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, including real property taxes prorated to the time of conveyance. The deed shall be submitted no later than two years after the approval of a phase's preliminary plat, or by the time that 50 percent of the certificates of occupancy for that phase have been issued, whichever is earlier. The parks board may grant an extension of time after the initial two years after subdivision plat or master plan approval has elapsed. 
C.  Private common open space. 
1.  Purpose. Private common open space is private open land area set aside for the exclusive use and enjoyment of a development's residents, employees, or users. Goals and requirements for common open space complement this Code's requirements for dedicated public open space and parks, and serve similar purposes. 
2.  Standards. 
(a)  Applicability. Subdivisions of land that propose 25 lots or more shall be required to dedicate, develop, and maintain private common open space for the use by residents as required in this section. 
(b)  Location criteria. To the maximum extent feasible, the subdivider, developer, or owner of property subject to this section shall give priority to the preservation of significant natural and scenic resource assets on a property, as private common open space. In reviewing the proposed location of private common open space areas, the director shall use all applicable plans, maps, and reports to determine whether significant resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected. The developer shall be responsible for identifying the following areas (which are not listed in a particular order): 
(1)  Wetlands; 
(2)  Flood hazard areas; 
(3)  Lakes, rivers, and stream/riparian corridors; 
(4)  Wildlife migration corridors; and 
(5)  Tree preservation areas. 
(c)  Areas not credited. Lands within the following areas shall not be counted towards required private common open space set-aside areas: 
(1)  Private yards; 
(2)  Public or private streets or rights-of-way; 
(3)  Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings; and 
(4)  Land covered by structures not intended solely for recreational uses. 
(d)  Use of common open space areas. Common open space areas shall not be disturbed, developed, or improved with any structures or buildings, except for the limited purposes allowed below: 
(1)  Facilities for active recreation (equipment for such uses shall be indicated on the site and/or subdivision landscape/amenity plan provided by the developer). 
(2)  Common open space areas may include passive recreational and educational purposes approved by the director of parks and recreation, including but not limited to walking, biking, picnicking, fishing, preservation of natural areas and scenic resources, parks, environmental education, and wildlife habitat protection. 
(3)  Clearing of underbrush and debris and the provision of walks, fountains, fences, restrooms, and similar features are allowed. 
(e)  Design criteria. Land set aside for private common open space shall meet the following design criteria, as relevant: 
(1)  Common open space areas shall be located so as to be readily accessible and useable by residents in various positions of the development, unless the lands are sensitive natural resources and access should be restricted. A minimum of 30 percent of the open space shall provide focal points for the neighborhood in the form of trails, play equipment, gazebos, or similar features. 
(2)  The lands shall be compact and contiguous unless the land shall be used as a continuation of an existing trail, or specific topographic features require a different configuration. An example of such topographic features would be the provision of a trail or private open area along a riparian corridor. 
(3)  Where private common open space areas, trails, parks, or other public spaces exist adjacent to the tract to be subdivided or developed, the private common open space shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently existing trail, park, or other open area land. 
(4)  If adjacent to a public open space or park, a private open space or park shall connect to the adjacent public land. 
(f)  Ownership. All private common open space areas shall be owned jointly or in common by the owners of the development. 
(g)  No fee in lieu. The payment of fees in lieu of the set-aside of land for private common open space uses is prohibited. 
D.  Appeals. Appeals of decisions made under this section shall be heard by the city council.

(c)  Nonconformities. Lots and properties to which lawful nonconforming status is terminated for any reason. 
2.  Timing of applicability to individual lots. Landscaping plans shall be submitted at such time a site plan is submitted for review or an application for a building permit or certificate of occupancy (whichever is earlier) on such lot is made. When the regulations of this section become applicable to a lot, the requirements are binding on all current and subsequent owners of the lot. 
3.  Relationship to other requirements. 
(a)  Use-specific standards. Any use required to provide landscaping or screening pursuant to the use-specific standards of this Code shall provide such use-specific landscaping or screening. In the event of a conflict between the use-specific requirements and the general requirements of this section, the use-specific provisions shall control. 
(b)  Tree preservation requirements. The general landscaping and screening requirements of this section shall be in addition to the requirements of subsection 77-504H., tree preservation. However, if an area designated for tree preservation is located in an area where general landscaping or screening would be required and where the preservation of existing vegetation would serve the same purpose as required landscaping or screening, then the applicant may receive a credit for the protected trees against the required landscaping as dictated in [subsection] 77-504H., tree preservation. 
C.  Administration and enforcement of landscaping provisions. 
1.  Form and content of application. To be accepted as complete, landscape plans shall be prepared by a person knowledgeable in plant material usage and landscape design (e.g., landscape architect, landscape contractor, landscape designer, etc.), prepared in the format specified by the director of planning or his/her designee and shall contain all information and supporting materials required by this section.

(4)  A wrought iron fence having a minimum height of not less than six feet nor more than eight feet in combination with evergreen plant material (minimum eight feet in height at time of planting) is required if a living screen is proposed. 
(d)  When large evergreen-type shrubs are planted as part of the living screen, other shrub requirements contained in this Code shall be waived only for the particular buffer where the living screen is planted. 
G.  [Reserved for future use.] 
H.  Tree preservation. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to encourage the preservation of long-established trees of sizes that, once removed, can be replaced only after many generations of tree growth; to preserve protected trees during construction; and to control the removal of protected trees. It is the intent of this section to achieve the following: 
(a)  Prohibit the indiscriminate clearing of trees from property; 
(b)  To the greatest extent possible, preserve and maintain protected trees so as to enhance the quality of development;

(b)  Removal of protected trees prohibited without tree removal permit. Unless the area or activity is exempt under subsection H.2 below, no person, directly or indirectly, shall cut down, destroy, remove or move, or effectively destroy through damaging, any protected tree situated on property regulated by this section without first obtaining a tree removal permit under subsection H.4.(c) below. 
(c)  Exemptions. Subsection 77-504(H) shall not apply to the following areas or activities: 
(1)  Single-family residential uses. Property of not more than two acres, already occupied by a single-family detached, single-family attached, duplex, or townhouse dwelling. However, any construction, paving, or other activity on the property that may damage trees on the public right-of-way shall comply with the standards of subchapter 77-504H.(e)(2), Tree protection during construction. 
(2)  Damaged/diseased trees. The removal of a tree that is dead, diseased, naturally fallen, damaged beyond the point of recovery, or in danger of falling, or a tree that the director of parks and recreation or designee finds to be a threat to public health, welfare, or safety. This would include requiring the removal of a diseased tree to reduce the chance of spreading the disease to adjacent healthy trees. Mitigation will be required if damage is caused by construction activity. 
(3)  Irregularly pruned trees. A tree that has been irregularly pruned in such a way so that it is damaged beyond the point of recovery and has lost its aesthetic value. Mitigating may be required at the direction of the director of planning or director of parks and recreation. 
(4)  Utility service interruption. The removal of a tree that has disrupted a public utility service due to a tornado, storm, flood, or other act of God. Removal shall be limited to the portion of the tree reasonably necessary to reestablish and maintain reliable utility service. 
(5)  Public right-of-way. Removal of a tree in the right-of-way owned or leased by a governmental entity. 
(6)  Public utility. Removal of a tree on property owned or leased by a public utility excluding property used for administration offices or functions.

All licensed plant or tree nurseries shall be exempt from the tree protection and replacement requirements and from the tree removal permit requirements only in relation to those trees planted and growing on the premises that are so planted and growing for sale to the general public. 
(8)  Golf course. Golf courses shall be exempt from the tree protection and replacement requirements and from the tree removal permit requirements for removal of protected trees within areas designated as tee boxes, fairways, or greens. All other areas shall be subject to the requirements of this section. 
3.  Tree removal permits. 
(a)  Purpose. This section sets forth the procedure for review and approval of tree removal permits, which are required prior to removal of any protected tree. 
(b)  Tree location map. 
(1)  General requirement. Applications for tree removal permits must be obtained from the planning department. All requests for tree removal permits shall be accompanied by a map showing at a minimum the requirements listed in subsection 8.c.ii.(B). below. These requirements may be modified by the director of planning as needed to administer this section. Upon prior approval by the director, the map exhibit may be limited only to the applicable portion of the site. An aerial photograph may be allowed to satisfy a portion of the requirements if densely populated by trees and no construction activity is to take place in this area. 
(2)  Map requirements. The location of all buildings, structures, and other improvements intended on the lot shall be shown. The limits of the construction line shall be shown, if applicable. The location of trees to be removed shall be located by measurements from the two nearest property lines and assigned a reference number as required by (D) below. The caliper (DBH) and common name of all protected tree(s) shall be shown. Any required replacement trees shall be shown with the caliper size, and the common name and scientific name of the tree. The scientific name will include Genus and species (e.g., Ulmus americana). 
(c)  Authority for review. 
(1)  The director shall be responsible for the review and approval of all requests for tree removal permits and associated tree survey and preservation plan for three trees or less submitted in accordance with the requirements specified in this section. Unless otherwise exempted above, the removal of more than three trees shall be approved by city council upon recommendation of the planning and zoning commission. 
(2)  At the discretion of the director applicants submitting a tree removal permit application not associate with development plans may be required to submit a final or preliminary landscape plan, and elevation renderings, depending on the scope of activity involved and the sensitivity of the location or the perceived value of any relative stand of trees in the permit request. 
(3)  The director may defer the approval of a tree removal permit and associated tree survey and preservation plan to the city council with recommendation of the planning and zoning commission for any reason. All decisions made by the city council shall be final and binding. 
(d)  Approval criteria. The director or the city council shall deny a tree removal permit and associated tree survey and preservation plan if it is determined that: 
(1)  Removal of the tree is not reasonably required in order to conduct anticipated activities; 
(2)  A reasonable accommodation can be made to preserve the tree; or 
(3)  The purpose and intent of this subchapter is not being met by the applicant. 
(e)  Appeal. Any tree removal permit and associated tree survey and preservation plan decision made by the director may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission, whose decision may be appealed to the city council. An appeal must be filed in writing with the director not more than 20 days after the rendering of a decision by the director or action taken by the planning and zoning commission. All decisions made by the council shall be final and binding. 
(f)  Permit expiration. Permits for tree removal shall be issued in connection with a building permit or site plan, and shall be valid for the period of that building permit's or site plan's validity. Permits for tree removal not issued in connection with a building permit or a site plan shall become void 180 days after the issue date on the permit. 
4.  Tree survey/preservation plan. 
(a)  When required. For all development subject to this subchapter 77-504H the applicant or developer shall prepare and submit a tree survey/preservation plan along with the site plan. 
(b)  Contents. The tree survey/preservation plan shall be a separate plan, and shall be submitted with the landscaping plan required in subchapter 77-504, Landscaping and screening, and any development required by subchapter 77-807. The tree survey/preservation plan shall contain sufficient detail and legibility to enable the city to verify compliance with this subchapter 77-504. The tree survey/preservation plan shall, at a minimum, include the following information: 
(1)  Identification and location of individual trees that are healthy and classified as a protected tree, or that are otherwise noteworthy because of species, age, size, or rarity. Each tree shall be referenced by a distinct number and the plan shall indicate the approximate canopy width of each tree or, if within a grove of protected trees where canopies combine, the overall width of the canopy. 
(2)  A summary table of protected trees on the site, containing: 
a.  Individual tree reference number; 
b.  Both the common name and the botanical name of each tree including Genus and species; 
c.  DBH, diameter of protected canopy trees and height of protected understory trees on the site; 
d.  General appearance of the tree(s) with regard to health; 
e.  Inches of credit, if applicable, and 
f.  Whether the tree is proposed for removal. 
(3)  Calculation (indicating formula) of total protected tree inches on site, number of protected tree inches to be removed, any credits, and mitigation tree inches required. 
(4)  The range of height, caliper, and canopy width of the trees on the site.

(c)  Prepared by knowledgeable professional. Tree survey/preservation plans shall be prepared by persons such as arborists, foresters, or landscape architects, who have the competence and knowledge to satisfactorily develop plans required by this section. 
(d)  Relationship to landscaping requirements. The requirements of this subchapter shall be in addition to the general landscaping requirements set forth in subchapter 77-504A through G. 
(e)  Standards for tree protection and replacement. 
(1)  Early tree removal prohibited. Thinning of trees is permitted prior to approval of a site plan; however, the removal of any protected tree, or the clearing or damage of trees from any contiguous area of 500 square feet or more, is prohibited unless authorized by an approved tree survey/preservation plan or site plan. Removal of any protected tree, or the clearing or damage of trees from any contiguous area less than 500 square feet must be approved by the director of parks and recreation or their designee. 
(2)  Tree protection during construction. During construction, the following limitations shall be observed in order to protect all protected trees that are not going to be removed: 
a.  Prior to construction. 
i.  Tree flagging. All protected trees or groups of trees to be saved on the subject property shall be flagged with bright, fluorescent, orange vinyl tape wrapped around the main trunk at a height of four feet or more such that the tape is visible to workers operating construction equipment. Such fencing shall be placed beneath the dripline/canopy edge to prevent all possible access or intrusion by construction equipment. Fencing shall be supported at a maximum of six-foot intervals by 4-stakes or by other approved methods. Single-incident access for the purposes of clearing underbrush with handheld equipment is allowed. A tag with an assigned reference number shall be located on each protected tree for future identification. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner and/or developer to ensure that such fencing and reference tags remain as required during the construction process. 
ii.  Protective fencing. Protective fencing around the critical root zone shall be required in the area of intended construction or grading. 
iii.  Bark protection. In situations where a protected tree remains in the immediate area of intended construction, the tree shall be protected by enclosing the entire circumference of the tree with two-inch by four-inch lumber encircled with wire or other means that do not damage the tree. The intent is to protect the bark of the tree against contact by large construction equipment. 
b.  Permanent construction methods. 
i.  Boring. Boring of utilities under protected trees may be required in certain circumstances. When required, the length of the bore shall be the width of the critical root zone at a minimum and shall be a minimum depth of 48 inches. 
ii.  Trenching. All trenching where possible shall be designed to avoid trenching across the critical root zone of any protected tree. This shall not inhibit the placement of necessary underground services such as water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, electric, telephone, or gas. 
iii.  Root pruning. All roots two inches or larger in diameter that are exposed as a result of trenching or other excavation shall be cut off square with a sharp medium-tooth saw and covered with pruning compound within two hours of initial exposure. 
c.  Issuance of permit; conditions. No building permit or grading permit shall be issued unless the applicant signs an application or permit that states that all construction activities have met the requirements of this subsection. The building official shall make available to the applicant a copy of this subsection. 
(3)  Prohibited activities. The following activities shall be prohibited within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree: 
i.  Material storage. No materials intended for use in construction, or soil and waste materials accumulated due to excavation or demolition, shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree. 
ii.  Equipment cleaning; liquid disposal. No liquid used to clean equipment (other than water) shall be deposited or allowed to flow overland within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree. Materials removed by cleaning, such as paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar, or similar materials, shall not be deposited or allowed to flow within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree. 
iii.  Tree attachments. No signs, wires, or other attachments, other than those of a protective nature, shall be attached to any protected tree. 
iv.  Vehicular traffic. No vehicular and/or construction equipment traffic or parking shall take place within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree other than on an existing pavement. This subsection does not apply to occasional access within a critical root zone for purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for routine utility maintenance or emergency restoration of utility service, or routine mowing operations. 
v.  Grade changes. No grade changes (cut or fill) shall be allowed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree unless adequate construction methods are approved by the director of planning. 
vi.  Impervious paving. Unless otherwise approved where no other option is available, no paving with asphalt, concrete, or other impervious materials in a manner that may reasonably be expected to kill a tree shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree. 
(4)  Replacement of protected trees. Protected trees removed pursuant to an approved tree removal permit and associated tree survey and preservation plan shall be replaced according to the following requirements: 
a.  Plan submittal. At the discretion of the director, applicants submitting a tree removal permit application not associated with development plans may be required to submit a final or preliminary landscape plan and elevation renderings, depending on the scope of activity involved and the sensitivity of the location or the perceived value of any relative stand of trees in the permit request. 
b.  Amount of replacement trees required. For each caliper inch removed, protected trees must be replaced at the following ratio: each caliper inch removed will be replaced with one caliper inch. Replacement trees must be a minimum of four-inch caliper. 
c.  Replacement restriction. Any required replacement tree shall be planted such that the mature canopy of the tree will not interfere with overhead utility lines. 
d.  Landscaping plans. Trees required to be added per the landscaping requirements in section 77-504 shall not be considered as replacement trees. Trees used as replacement trees must be clearly indicated as such on the landscaping plan. 
e.  Credit for saved trees. For every one-caliper inch that is saved, the developer shall receive a credit of one-caliper inch that does not have to be replaced. 
f.  Replacement trees planted off site. Replacement trees may be planted off site in areas or locations approved by the director or city council upon recommendation from the planning and zoning commission and may be planted: 
i.  Within a specified city-designated park or other city-owned property or facility; 
ii.  Within a specified private open space (i.e. private park, preserve, or similar property that is open for public use); or 
iii.  Within a specified public right-of-way median. 
g.  Tree mitigation fees. In lieu of planting replacement trees, the director or city council, upon recommendation from the planning and zoning commission, may approve a request to pay tree mitigation fees. The city council has the authority to waive or reduce mitigation fees as they see fit: 
i.  The director shall assess tree mitigation fees paid in lieu of replacement tree planting during submission and review of a tree survey and preservation plan and/or tree removal permit application. Fees shall be collected prior to issuance of a tree removal permit and deposited into the reforestation fund. 
ii.  The director shall determine the monetary value of a replacement tree by contacting landscape companies, plant nurseries, or garden centers for the price of a four-inch caliper tree installed, then averaging that cost to determine the mean cost of a four-inch tree; and then dividing by four to determine the mean cost of a one-inch tree installed. The mean cost of a one-inch tree installed is then multiplied by the required number of replacement tree inches proposed for fee payment in lieu of planting. Said formula is represented as follows: 
((A+B+C+D)/4)/4 * X = Replacement Tree Escrow Fee where A, B, C, and D represent the installed cost of a four-inch tree from four sources, and where X represents the required number of replacement tree inches. 
(5)  Tree pruning restrictions. 
a.  Generally. No protected tree shall be pruned in such a manner that significantly disfigures the tree or in a manner that would reasonably lead to the death of a tree, except where such pruning is necessary for safety and function of utilities. 
b.  Pruning standards. All pruning shall be in accordance with the National Arborist Association Standards for Pruning of Canopy Trees. 
(6)  Maintenance or replacement. If any of the trees proposed for protection or trees planted as a part of this section should die within a period of one year after completion of the activities associated with construction, the owner of the property shall replace the trees within six months at a ratio of one-to-one with an approved tree. 
(7)  In the event of a conflict or inconsistency with the provisions of this section and any other provision in the Code of Ordinances, this section shall prevail. 
(8)  Violations. A violation of this section, including but not limited to illegal or unauthorized tree removal, is a zoning and land use violation and shall be subject to the fines and penalties thereof. 
(f)  Incentive for additional tree protection. Applicants are encouraged to save as much existing vegetation and tree cover on a development site as possible. A reduction in the number of required parking spaces may be granted for preservation of additional tree cover beyond that required by this section, so that the reduction in the amount of required pavement can help preserve existing healthy trees in an undisturbed, natural condition. The amount of reduction can be determined only after taking into consideration any unique site conditions and the impact of the reduction on parking needs for the use. The reduction of parking shall only occur where the trees being protected are within the parking area. The maximum reduction in parking under this section shall not exceed 20 percent. 
I.  Alternative landscape plan. 
1.  Purpose and intent. An alternative landscape plan (ALP) is intended to promote the preservation and incorporation of existing native vegetation or specimen trees, or for the innovative use of plant material and improved site design. 
2.  Applicability. Any development plan application may be eligible to apply for an ALP. 
(a)  Design principles. To qualify for consideration an application for an ALP shall demonstrate compliance with the following principles: 
(1)  Innovative use of plant materials and design techniques in response to unique characteristics of the specific site. 
(2)  Preservation and/or incorporation of existing native vegetation. 
(3)  Use of a variety of plant material in excess of minimum requirements. 
(4)  Incorporation of naturalistic design principles, such as variations in topography, meandering or curvilinear plantings, and grouping of dominant plant materials in a manner consistent with existing native vegetation. 
(5)  Integration of landscaping with on-site pedestrian facilities as well as potential connections to existing or proposed adjacent pedestrian facilities. 
(6)  Use of additional shade trees to create a greater canopy effect. 
(7)  A greater degree of compatibility with surrounding uses than a standard landscape plan would offer, provided the resulting landscape conforms to the design principles and guidelines of this section. 
(8)  Use of water-efficient irrigation systems and xeriscaping at appropriate locations. 
(9)  Incorporation of specific environmental attributes such as soil, hydrology, and vegetative communities unique to the site, and which are compatible with environmental features on-site and on adjacent properties. 
(b)  Allowable modifications to standards. The standards that can be modified through the use of an ALP are listed below. Any standard not listed herein shall not be eligible to be modified through an ALP. 
(1)  Perimeter buffer landscape requirements; trees and shrubs; 
(2)  Perimeter buffer landscape requirements, ROW buffer width; 
(3)  Perimeter buffer landscape requirements, compatibility buffer standards; 
(4)  Perimeter buffer landscape requirements, incompatibility buffer standards; 
(5)  Single-family residential development requirements, landscape buffer; 
(6)  Single-family residential development requirements, entryway areas; 
(7)  Single-family residential development requirements, masonry wall requirements; 
(8)  Dumpster and trash compactor screening. 
3.  Application requirements. An application for an ALP shall be in a form established by the director of planning or his/her designee, and shall include a narrative and any necessary supporting documentation that clearly details and demonstrates compliance with this section. 
4.  Approval. ALPs must be submitted in conjunction with a development plan application subject to the following requirements: 
(a)  Required findings. An ALP shall only be approved upon finding that: 
(1)  There are unique characteristics of the property, site design or use that warrant special consideration to modify or deviate from the requirements of this section and that these characteristics are not self-created. 
(2)  The ALP meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of this section, while recognizing the unusual site design or use restraints on the property. 
(3)  Approval of the ALP will provide for both increased consistency and compatibility with adjacent projects located in the general vicinity of the property. 
(4)  The ALP conforms to the requirements of this section and no modifications are requested except those explicitly provided in subsection 77-504I.2(b). 
(b)  Approval process. The planning and zoning commission may approve an ALP, provided the subject property is less than one gross acre and the total right-of-way frontage is less than 250 feet. If the subject property is at least one gross acre or the total right-of-way frontage is greater than 250 feet, then an ALP may be allowed by recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and approval of the city council. 
(c)  Appeals. The decision of the planning and zoning commission to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an alternative landscape plan may be appealed to the city council. An appeal shall be filed in writing with the director of planning not more than 20 days after the rendering of the decision or action taken by the planning and zoning commission. The city council shall vote by simple majority vote of those members present at the meeting to either approve or deny the appeal, which decision shall be final and binding. 
J.  Approved plant list. The following is a list of plants and trees recommended for required landscape areas. Plants and trees marked with an asterisk require lower water needs.

Sec. 77-505. - Transportation and access. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to support the creation of a highly connected transportation system within the city in order to provide choices for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians; increase effectiveness of municipal service delivery; promote walking and bicycling; connect neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations such as employment, schools, parks, and shopping centers; reduce vehicle miles of travel and travel times; improve air quality; reduce emergency response times; mitigate the traffic impacts of new development, and free up arterial capacity to better serve regional long-distance travel needs. 
B.  Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to all development in the city. However, developments with lot frontage along Lakeview Parkway (SH 66) and the President George Bush Turnpike (PGBT) frontage roads shall conform to the provisions of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Access Management Manual and Regulations for Access Driveways to State Highways as it pertains to access management and driveway criteria. If a TxDOT requirement and a requirement contained within this section are in conflict, the more stringent will prevail. 
C.  Traffic impact mitigation. 
1.  Applicability of traffic impact analysis requirement. The transportation system for new development shall be capable of supporting the proposed development in addition to the existing uses in the area. Evaluation of system capacity shall be undertaken through a traffic impact analysis (TIA), which should consider the following factors without limitation: street capacity and level of service; vehicle access and loading; on-street parking impacts; the availability of transit service and connections to transit; impacts on adjacent neighborhoods; and traffic safety including pedestrian safety. At a minimum, a traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be required with applications for development review and approval when: 
(a)  The development exceeds 100 parking spaces average per driveway; 
(b)  Any driveway in the development is projected to serve 1,000 or more vehicles per day; 
(c)  Any driveway in the development is projected to serve 100 ingress vehicles or more in the peak hour of the adjacent street; 
(d)  A TIA is required by the city engineer as a condition of any land use application approved pursuant to the requirements of this Code; or 
(e)  The city engineer may also require a TIA for: 
i.  Any project that proposes access to a street with level of service "C" or below; 
ii.  Any case where the previous TIA for the property is more than two years old; or 
iii.  Any case where the director of planning and the city engineer determine that the increased land use intensity will result in increased traffic generation. 
2.  TIA and development review process. 
(1)  A scoping meeting between the developer and the city engineer shall be required prior to the start of the TIA in order to determine its parameters. The traffic generation for the development shall assume the highest traffic generator for each use by right allowed for the zoning applicable to the property or requested by the applicant. 
(2)  When access points are not defined or a site plan is not available at the time the TIA is prepared, additional studies may be required when a site plan becomes available or the access points are defined. 
3.  Traffic mitigation measures. The applicant shall, as part of the TIA, recommend measures to minimize and/or mitigate the anticipated impacts and determine the adequacy of the development's planned access points. Mitigation measures shall be acceptable to the city engineer and may include, without limitation: an access management plan; transportation demand management measures; street improvements on or off the site; placement of pedestrian, bicycle or transit facilities on or off the site; or other capital improvement projects such as traffic calming infrastructure or capacity improvements. 
[D.  Reserved.] 
E.  Streets and on-site vehicular circulation. 
1.  Street design standards. All streets shall meet the design standards set forth in subsection 77-603(C). 
2.  Street connectivity. 
(a)  Purpose. Street and block patterns shall include a clear hierarchy of well-connected streets that distribute traffic over multiple streets and avoid traffic congestion on principal routes. Within each residential development, the access and circulation system should accommodate the safe, efficient, and convenient movement of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians through the development, and provide ample opportunities for linking adjacent neighborhoods, properties, and land uses. Local neighborhood street systems are intended to provide multiple direct connections to and between local destinations such as parks, schools, and shopping. These connections should knit separate developments together, rather than forming barriers between them. 
(b)  Vehicular access to public streets. Any development of more than 100 residential units, or additions to existing developments such that the total number of units exceeds 100 residential units, shall be required to provide vehicular access to at least four public streets unless such provision is deemed impractical by the city engineer due to topography, natural features, design of the affected streets and their ability to absorb increased traffic with minimal impact, or the configuration of adjacent developments. 
(c)  Connections to vacant land. Where new development is adjacent to land likely to be developed or redeveloped in the future, all streets, bicycle paths, and access ways in the development's proposed street system shall continue through to the boundary lines of the area, as determined by the director of planning, to provide for the orderly subdivision of such adjacent land or the transportation and access needs of the community. In addition, all redevelopment and street improvement projects shall take advantage of opportunities for retrofitting existing streets to provide increased vehicular and pedestrian connectivity. 
(d)  Residential streets. 
(1)  Minor residential streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Traffic calming techniques such as diverters, neck downs, street gardens, curvilinear alignments, road humps, etc. shall be encouraged to reduce speeds and cut-through traffic. The city engineer shall determine if traffic control devices may be used to regulate and calm traffic. 
(2)  Residential minor streets shall be designed and platted so that no street segment shall have a straight line for more than 1,000 feet before altering its course by at least 20 degrees. 
(e)  Access. 
(1)  Every proposed public or private street system shall be designed to provide vehicular interconnections to all similar or compatible adjacent uses (existing and future) by complying with the standards of subchapter 77-505F, Access management and driveway standards. 
(2)  Unless it is jointly determined by the director of public works and director of planning that safety issues may develop or that topographical constraints exist, all non-residential development shall be designed to allow for cross-access to adjacent properties to encourage shared parking and provide shared ingress and egress to public or private streets. 
(3)  When cross-access is deemed impractical by the city engineer on the basis of topography, the presence of natural features, or vehicular safety factors, this requirement may be waived provided that appropriate bicycle and pedestrian connections are provided between adjacent developments or land uses. A cross access easement shall be described on a final plat and filed for record prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development. 
(4)  Whenever feasible, there shall be no direct access (ingress or egress) from any single-family residential lots to any secondary residential thoroughfare and above thoroughfare classification (that is, arterials, etc.). Therefore, whenever feasible, all single-family residential lots shall have direct thoroughfare access only from local residential streets. 
(5)  No single-family detached or two-family lots shall front on an arterial street. 
(f)  Culs-de-sac and dead-end streets. Permanent culs-de-sac shall be used when topography, uniqueness of the subdivision layout, the presence of natural features, and/or vehicular safety factors make a vehicular connection impractical. Temporary culs-de-sac constructed according to city standards may be approved on adjacent lot or parcel during a phased development, where there is common ownership of the two parcels. Dead-end streets are prohibited, except where necessary to connect to a proposed street located in a phased development, and under the same ownership. Culs-de-sac, where allowed, shall comply with the design standards set forth in subchapter 77-603C.6. 
(g)  Neighborhood protection from cut-through traffic. The design of street systems shall not use streets through existing residential subdivisions unless necessary for connectivity where the resulting traffic is less than the design capacity of the existing street(s). Street connections shall connect neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations such as schools, parks, greenbelt trail systems, and shopping centers, while minimizing neighborhood cut-through vehicle traffic movements that are non-local in nature. Configuration of local and internal streets and traffic calming measures shall be used to discourage use of the local street system for cut-through collector or arterial vehicle traffic. A traffic impact analysis may be required by the city engineer to determine capacity and other such issues as determined by the city engineer. 
(h)  Standards for pedestrian facilities. 
(1)  Sidewalks. 
a.  All sidewalks shall comply with the city's adopted standards and specifications. 
b.  Sidewalks that conform to the width and size of the master trail plan shall be installed on both sides of all arterials, collector streets, and local streets (including loop streets and culs-de-sac), and within and along the frontage of all new development or redevelopment. The sidewalk shall be constructed before the final building inspection by the city. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued or a final inspection made until the sidewalk is in place. 
c.  To the extent feasible, pedestrian crossings shall be made safer for pedestrians whenever possible by shortening crosswalk distance with curb extensions, reducing sidewalk curb radii, and eliminating free right-turn lanes. Signals that allow longer crossing times in commercial and mixed-use districts, mid-block crossings in high-pedestrian use areas (if well-marked and traffic speeds are low), and raised crosswalks and medians shall be provided as appropriate. 
(2)  On-site pedestrian walkways. 
a.  Continuous pedestrian access. Pedestrian walkways shall form an on-site circulation system that minimizes conflict between pedestrians and traffic at all points of pedestrian access to on-site parking and building entrances. Fencing installed along walkways shall be open (e.g., wrought iron) to provide security to users of the walkway. 
b.  On-site pedestrian connections. Site plans shall orient to pedestrian site access points and connections to surrounding street and trails networks, to destinations such as schools or shopping within one-quarter mile of the site, and to pedestrian linkage points on adjacent parcels, including building entrances, transit stops, walkway easements, and signalized street crossings. On-site pedestrian walkways shall connect (a) building entrances to one another and (b) from building entrances to public sidewalk connections and existing or planned transit stops. If buildings are not placed directly on the public sidewalk, then pedestrian walkways shall link the principal pedestrian site access to building entrances. All developments that contain more than one building shall provide walkways between the principal entrances of the buildings. 
c.  Block connections. Trails and access easements shall be dedicated and provided according to plans adopted by the city. The amount of land to be dedicated shall be determined based on an individualized finding that the land being dedicated is reasonably related to the impacts upon the city that will be generated by the residents and users of the subject development. 
F.  Access management and driveway standards. Vehicular access to lots, tracts, and parcels of land shall be designed, constructed, provided, or repaired in accordance with the following standards and requirements. Developments with lot frontage along Lakeview Parkway (SH 66) and the President George Bush Turnpike (PGBT) frontage roads shall conform to the provisions of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Access Management Manual and Regulations for Access Driveways to State Highways as it pertains to access management and driveway criteria. Vehicular access must conform to standards established by Texas Department of Transportation, North Texas Tollway Authority and Federal Highway Administration. If a TxDOT requirement and a requirement contained within this section are in conflict, the more stringent will prevail. 
1.  Single-family detached and duplex residential driveways. 
(a)  Number. 
(1)  All driveway connections shall be from an alley and shall be limited to one connection per lot, tract, or parcel, except as described below for circular driveways. Driveway connections from an alley shall not extend past the front building line. In areas where no alley is required, driveway connections shall be from the street. 
(2)  No access to residential property shall be allowed from any Type A+ through B thoroughfare. 
(3)  Circular driveways may be permitted from the street provided they do not extend past the front building line nor shall they connect to any driveway connection from an alley. 
(b)  Location. 
(1)  Driveways connecting to alleys shall be a minimum of 20 feet from the intersection of the alley and a public street. The distance shall be measured from the corner made by the intersecting street and alley right-of-way lines to the nearest edge of driveway pavement at the alley right-of-way line exclusive of curb return radii or fillets. 
(2)  Where driveways connecting to minor public streets are permitted, they shall be a minimum of 25 feet from the intersection of the street with a second public street. Where streets are paved to include curb and gutter, the distance shall be measured from curb return to curb return. Where no curb exists, the distance shall be measured from the corner made by the intersecting street right-of-way lines to the nearest edge of driveway pavement at the street right-of-way line exclusive of curb return radii or fillets. 
(c)  Spacing. The minimum spacing between driveways shall be ten feet except when adjacent property owners have made written request to the city engineer for a shared driveway connection. The distance shall be measured between the nearest edges of driveway pavements at the street or alley right-of-way line exclusive of curb return radii or fillets. 
(d)  Curb return radius termination. The termination of a driveway curb return radius or fillet shall not extend beyond the projection of the property line between two adjacent lots, tracts, or parcels of land to the street or alley from its intersection with the right-of-way line. The termination point of a driveway radius or fillet shall be a minimum of ten feet from a storm sewer inlet and five feet from a fire hydrant. 
(e)  Shared driveway connection. Adjacent property owners may make a written request to the city engineer for a shared driveway connection. A shared driveway connection is created when the driveways of adjacent properties both abut the shared property line. The total width of the shared driveway may not exceed 24 feet in width at the street or alley right-of-way line exclusive of curb return radii or fillets. 
(f)  Width. A driveway serving a single-family detached or duplex residential lot, tract, or parcel shall not be less than ten feet nor more than 20 feet in width at the street or alley right-of-way line exclusive of curb return radii or fillets. 
(g)  Curb return. 
(1)  Driveway connections to alleys without curbs shall be constructed with fillets in lieu of curb returns. Driveway fillets shall have minimum dimensions of five feet along the edge of the alley pavement and five feet along the edge of the driveway pavement. 
(2)  Driveway connections to public streets or alleys with curbs shall be constructed with curb returns. The curb returns shall have a minimum radius of five feet, except for driveway connections to streets listed on the adopted thoroughfare plan as arterial and secondary arterial streets. 
(3)  The curb return radii for driveway connections to arterial and secondary arterial streets shall be determined by the city engineer. 
(h)  Driveway connection angle. A driveway connection angle to an alley or public street may vary from 80 to 100 degrees. 
(i)  Sidewalk intersections. Where a driveway is designed to cross an existing sidewalk, the sidewalk included between the edges of the driveway pavement shall be removed and reconstructed integral to the driveway. Sidewalk cross-slope within driveways shall not exceed Texas Accessibility Standards (TAS) maximums. 
(j)  Special conditions for circular driveways. 
(1)  All requests for circular driveways for single-family detached residential land uses may be approved subject to the following conditions: 
(2)  A corner lot at the intersection of two local residential streets or at the intersection of a local residential street and a collector street may have one circular driveway connection on each street subject to the corner and property line clearance requirements of this Code; 
(3)  A minimum 70 foot frontage lot with only single street frontage on a local residential or collector street may have a maximum of two circular driveway connections in the front yard subject to the corner and property line clearance requirements of this Code; 
(4)  A lot with only single street frontage on a street classified as a Type A+ through B thoroughfare on the adopted thoroughfare plan may have a maximum of two circular driveway connections in the front yard subject to the corner and property line clearance requirements of this Code. This provision shall not be interpreted to allow residential to front onto such thoroughfares after adoption of this Code; 
(5)  A circular driveway shall provide access to required parking if such parking is not accessible from an alley driveway connection; 
(6)  The deflection angle of a circular driveway connection to the public street may vary from 45 degrees to 90 degrees; 
(7)  The curb return radius of the obtuse entry or exit angle of each circular driveway connection shall be a minimum of 20 feet; and 
(8)  Circular driveways shall not be approved for duplex residential land uses. 
(k)  Nonconforming single-family detached and duplex residential driveways. 
(1)  Single-family detached and duplex residential driveways not conforming to the requirements of this Code may remain in service until such time as they are reconstructed, except if reconstruction shall be required where the city engineer, based upon an engineering study provided by the developer, determines the nonconforming driveway constitutes a traffic safety hazard. 
(2)  If a nonconforming single-family detached or duplex residential driveway cannot be reconstructed to conform to this Code, the owner of the property may seek a variance from the board of adjustment as provided in Chapter 77-800, Review and approval procedures. 
2.  Multifamily land uses and all nonresidential land uses. 
(a)  Driveway types. 
(1)  Partial access driveways. 
a.  Entry only. A driveway designed in such a manner as to prohibit the flow of traffic from a lot, parcel, or tract of land into a street. 
b.  Exit only. A driveway designed in such a manner as to prohibit the flow of traffic from a street into a lot, parcel, or tract of land. 
c.  Right turn in/right turn out. A driveway designed in such a manner that only right turn traffic movements into and out of the driveway are allowed. 
(2)  Full access driveways. 
a.  Full access, undivided. A driveway permitting two-way undivided traffic flow where all turning movements into and out of the driveway are permitted without restriction. 
b.  Full access, divided. A driveway permitting two-way traffic flow where all turning movements into and out of the driveway are permitted without restriction and where the entering and exiting traffic flows are separated by a median island. 
_____ 
(b)  Number of driveways. 
(1)  Each platted lot shall be permitted one driveway contained wholly within the property frontage or as part of a joint access easement with an adjacent platted lot, tract, or parcel of land. 
(2)  Where the platted lot is at the intersection of two streets, the permitted driveway shall connect to the lower adopted thoroughfare plan classification of street except that no access shall be permitted to a local residential street without the prior approval of the city engineer. 
(3)  Additional driveways may be permitted provided the minimum driveway spacing and location requirements are met as follows:

c.  For full access driveways with two or more entry lanes, one of which is dedicated to right turns entering the driveway, the minimum length of an exclusive right turn lane shall be the distance required to decelerate from the posted speed limit of the public street to the design speed of the right turn into the driveway as provided in the latest edition of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. 
d.  For full access driveways with two or more entry lanes and where the right turn entering the driveway does so using a turning roadway, the minimum length of an exclusive right turn lane shall be the distance required to decelerate from the posted speed limit of the public street to the design speed of the right turn into the driveway as provided in the latest edition of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. 
e.  Where several successive driveways require exclusive right turn lanes, and the driveway spacing is not adequate to avoid encroachment of the right turn lane on another driveway, a continuous right-turn lane shall be used. 
f.  Right turn lane length shall be measured from the end of the right turn transition taper to the point of curvature of the curb return radius into the driveway. 
g.  A continuous deceleration lane may be required as a condition of a driveway permit when two or more deceleration lanes are planned and their proximity necessitates they be combined for proper traffic control and safety. The transition taper for a continuous deceleration lane shall not extend into or beyond a street intersection. 
h.  In the event an applicant is allowed to locate a driveway connecting to a deceleration lane within 100 feet of an arterial intersection, the applicant shall be required to extend the deceleration lane to such intersection. The 100 feet shall be measured from the nearest edge of the driveway throat to the nearest ROW line of the intersecting arterial. 
(q)  Median openings. 
(1)  There shall be three classifications of median openings as follows: 
a.  Full median opening. An opening in the median of a roadway permitting all traffic movements into and out of a properly aligned driveway. 
b.  Left turn entry only. An opening in the median of a roadway that permits left turns into a properly aligned driveway but prevents all other cross median traffic movements. 
c.  Left turn exit only. An opening in the median of a roadway that permits left turns from a properly aligned driveway but prevents all other cross median traffic movements. 
(2)  Median opening to or from a driveway may be allowed if: 
a.  The median is of sufficient length to be subdivided into multiple medians, each of which meets or exceeds the minimum median length described in this chapter. 
b.  The median is of sufficient width to permit the construction of an exclusive left turn lane. 
c.  An engineering study justifies the opening after consideration of the impact on traffic operations, levels of service and safety. 
d.  Such opening does not adversely impact the provision for access to a lot, parcel, or tract of land on the opposite side of the street.

b.  The minimum length of a full median opening shall be of sufficient length so that concurrent turning maneuvers from exclusive left turn lanes serving the driveways on each side of the roadway do not conflict with each other. 
c.  The maximum length of a full median opening shall be limited so that the median opening serves only a single driveway on each side of the roadway. 
(5)  Relocation of existing median openings. A property owner may request permission from the city engineer to close an existing median opening and relocate it to a different point along the roadway upon submission of a letter of request to the city engineer and supporting letters from all property owners whose cross median access is affected by such relocation. 
(r)  Exclusive left turn lane required. 
a.  Construction of exclusive turn lanes shall be required at all full median openings providing cross median access to driveways on each side of a roadway and at all entry only median openings 
b.  Construction of deceleration and/or acceleration lanes shall be as determined through a traffic impact analysis or at a minimum as shown in Figure 2.

3.  Schedule C. Uses that reference "Schedule C" in Off-Street Parking Schedule A have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to Schedule C standards, the director of planning shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking requirements on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant. Such a study shall include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the director of planning, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. 
4.  Maximum number of spaces permitted. 
(a)  General maximum requirement. For any use categorized as a "Commercial" or "Industrial" use in Table 3-1, Table of Allowed Uses, off-street vehicle parking spaces shall not be provided in an amount that is more than 125 percent of the minimum requirements established in Table 5.6-1, Off-Street Parking Schedule A. The maximum number of allowable parking spaces may be adjusted by the director of planning if the applicant provides written information documenting that the proposed commercial or industrial use would not be economically viable without such adjustment. 
(b)  Exceptions. If application of the maximum parking standard would result in less than six parking spaces, the development shall be allowed six parking spaces. 
(c)  For the purpose of calculating parking requirements, the following types of parking spaces shall not count against the maximum parking requirement, but shall count toward the minimum requirement: 
i.  Accessible parking. 
ii.  Vanpool and carpool parking. 
iii.  Structured parking, underground parking, and parking within, above, or beneath the building(s) it serves. 
(d)  For the purpose of calculating parking requirements, the following types of parking spaces shall not count against either the minimum or maximum requirements: 
i.  Fleet vehicle parking. 
(e)  The maximum parking requirement may be exceeded in situations that meet the following criteria if approved by the director of planning: 
(1)  The proposed development has unique or unusual characteristics such as high sales volume per floor area or low parking turnover, which create a parking demand that exceeds the maximum ratio and which typically does not apply to comparable uses; and, 
(2)  The parking demand cannot be accommodated by on-street parking, shared parking with nearby uses, or by increasing the supply of spaces that are exempt from the maximum ratio; and, 
(3)  The request is the minimum necessary variation from the standards; and, 
(4)  If located in a mixed-use district, the uses in the proposed development and the site design are highly supportive of the mixed-use concept and support high levels of existing or planned transit and pedestrian activity. 
5.  Incentive for tree protection. Applicants are encouraged to save as much existing vegetation and tree cover on a development site as possible. A maximum reduction of 20 percent in the number of required parking spaces may be granted for preservation of additional tree cover beyond that required by this Code; see subchapter 77-504H. 
C.  Parking lot layout and design plan (10 or more spaces). 
1.  Applicability. For all proposed parking lots with ten or more spaces, the applicant shall submit a parking lot layout and design plan for review and approval by the director of planning. The plan shall contain sufficient detail to enable the director of planning to verify compliance with this subchapter 77-506, Off-street parking and loading. Subject to approval of the director of planning, the parking layout and design plan may be combined with other plans required under this Code, such as the landscaping plan required in [subchapter] 77-504, Landscaping and screening. 
2.  Minimum plan requirements. 
(a)  The parking lot layout and design plan shall be prepared by a design professional such as a certified land use planner, landscape architect, professional engineer, or architect registered in the State of Texas. Such plans shall not be prepared by land surveyors unless they are an otherwise qualified design professional. 
(b)  All parking layout and design plans and site plans are subject to review and approval by the director of planning to ensure that provisions have been made for minimum interference with street traffic flow and safe interior vehicular and pedestrian circulation, transit, and parking. 
D.  Parking alternatives. The director of planning may approve alternatives to providing the number of off-street parking spaces required by Table 5.6-1, in accordance with the following standards. 
1.  Shared parking. The director of planning may approve shared parking facilities for developments or uses with different operating hours or different peak business periods if the shared parking complies with all of the following standards: 
(a)  Location. Shared parking spaces shall not be located farther than 600 feet of an entrance. 
(b)  Zoning classification. Shared parking areas shall be located on a site with the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the primary uses served. 
(c)  Shared parking study. Those proposing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements shall submit a shared parking analysis to staff that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study shall be provided in a form established by the director of planning and shall be made available to the public. It shall address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, location of required parking, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover, and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. The applicant shall also demonstrate that any parking reduction requested as part of the shared parking study will not result in the spillover of parking onto other properties. 
(d)  Agreement for shared parking. The parties involved in the joint use of off-street parking facilities shall submit a written agreement in a form to be recorded for such joint use, approved by the director of planning as to form and content. The director of planning may impose such conditions of approval as may be necessary to ensure the adequacy of parking in areas affected by such an agreement. Recordation of the agreement with the county shall take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the shared parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with the requirements of subchapter 77-506, Off-site parking. 
2.  Off-site parking. The director of planning may approve the location of required off-site parking spaces on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if the off-site parking complies with all of the following standards: 
(a)  Location. No off-site parking space may be located more than 600 feet from an entrance (measured along the shortest legal pedestrian route). Off-site parking spaces shall be connected to the use by acceptable pedestrian facilities. Off-site parking spaces may not be separated from the use served by a street right-of-way with a width of more than 80 feet, unless a grade-separated pedestrian walkway, a traffic signal, a shuttle bus, or other traffic control is provided or other traffic control or remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. 
(b)  Zoning classification. Off-site parking areas shall have the same or a more intensive zoning classification applicable to the primary use served. 
(c)  Control of site. Required parking spaces for residential uses must be located on the site of the use or within a tract owned in common by all the owners of the properties that will use the tract. 
(d)  Ineligible activities. Required parking spaces for persons with disabilities may not be located off-site. 
(e)  Agreement for off-site parking. In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement between the record owners shall be required. The parties shall submit a written agreement in a form to be recorded for such use, approved by the director of planning as to form and content. The director of planning may impose such conditions of approval as may be necessary to ensure the adequacy of parking in areas affected by such an agreement. Recordation of the agreement shall take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. No use shall be continued if the parking is removed unless substitute parking facilities are provided, and the director of planning shall be notified at least 60 days prior to the termination of a lease for off-site parking. 
3.  On-street parking. Where allowed by the zoning district, on-street parking spaces in the right-of-way along the property line, that routed between the two side lot lines of the site, may be counted to satisfy the minimum off-street parking requirements, if approved by the city engineer. 
4.  District parking. Minimum required off-street parking spaces may be waived or reduced for properties within the boundaries of a public parking or local improvement district that provides district-wide parking facilities, based on the projected parking demand to be addressed by the district-wide facility. 
5.  Stacked, tandem, and valet parking. Stacked, tandem, or valet parking for nonresidential uses is allowed if an attendant is present to move vehicles. In addition, a guarantee acceptable to the city shall be filed with the city ensuring that a valet parking attendant shall always be on duty when the parking lot is in operation. 
6.  Structured parking. 
(a)  Maximum parking waiver. Where 75 percent or more of the parking accessory to a use is in structured parking, there shall be no maximum cap on the number of parking spaces. 
(b)  Credit for nearby public structured parking. In the downtown and mixed-use districts, spaces available in public parking structures located within 1,000 feet of the subject use may be counted toward the total amount of required off-street parking. 
(c)  Floor area bonus for automated and underground parking in the commercial and mixed-use districts. A floor area bonus shall be granted for underground parking structures and automated parking structures in the commercial and mixed-use districts. The bonus shall be granted at a ratio of three square feet of additional bonus area for each square foot of structured parking that is underground or within an automated parking structure. 
7.  Sites in mixed-use districts. In the mixed-use districts, the total requirement for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately, except as follows: 
(a)  All uses within MU districts shall be eligible for a five percent parking reduction to reflect the reduced automobile use associated with mixed-use developments. 
(b)  A ten percent parking reduction for multifamily residential dwellings may be allowed if the proposed use is located within 300 feet of a transit stop. 
(c)  The total number of parking spaces required of a use or uses in a MU district may be further reduced by the planning and zoning commission if the applicant prepares a parking evaluation that demonstrates a reduction is appropriate based on the expected parking needs of the development, availability of mass transit, and similar factors and the city engineer accepts such study as an accurate reflection of parking demand. The parking evaluation shall be prepared in a form and manner prescribed by the director of planning. 
(d)  Other eligible alternatives. The director of planning may approve any other alternative to providing off-street parking spaces on the site of the subject development if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director of planning that the proposed plan will protect surrounding neighborhoods, maintain traffic circulation patterns, and promote quality urban design to at least the same extent as would strict compliance with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards. 
E.  Off-street loading requirements. No building or structure used for any commercial, business, industrial, or public/institutional use shall be erected, nor shall any such existing building or structure be altered so as to increase its gross floor area by 25 percent, without prior provision for off-street loading space in conformance with the following minimum requirements: 
1.  Types of loading berths. Required off-street loading space shall be provided in berths that conform to the following minimum specifications: 
(a)  Type A berths shall be at least 60 feet long by ten feet wide by 14 feet six inches high, inside dimensions. 
(b)  Type B berths shall be at least 30 feet long by ten feet wide by 14 feet six inches high, inside dimensions. 
(c)  Type C berths shall be located in the rear of a lot and utilize part of an adjacent alley. The building setback shall be a minimum of five feet from the property line along the alley for the entire width of the lot.

3.  Uses not specifically mentioned. In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in this section, the requirements for off-street loading facilities shall be the same as the use mentioned in this section which, in the opinion of the director of planning, has most similar parking characteristics to the use mentioned in terms of loading classification. 
4.  Concurrent different uses. When any proposed structure will be used concurrently for different purposes, final determination of loading requirements shall be made by the director of planning, but in no event shall the loading requirements be less than the total requirements for each use based upon its aggregate gross floor area. 
5.  Location of off-street loading facilities. Off-street loading facilities required under this title shall be in all cases on the same lot or parcel of land as the structure they are intended to serve. The required off-street loading space shall not be part of the area used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements unless approved by the director of planning based on the adequacy of the site to accommodate both simultaneously. The placement of proposed off-street loading facilities adjacent to residential areas or in an area with a residential zoning classification shall be considered for noise and glare impacts. Mitigation techniques, including appropriate siting and site design measures, may be required by the planning and zoning commission. 
6.  Manner of using loading areas. No space for loading or unloading of vehicles shall be so located that a vehicle using such loading space projects into any public right-of-way or fire lane. Loading space shall be provided with access to an alley, or, if no alley adjoins the lot, with access to a street. Any required front, side, or rear yard may be used for loading unless otherwise prohibited by this title. Design and location of entrances and exits for required off-street loading areas shall be subject to the approval of the director of planning based on consideration of the traffic flow and traffic safety. Service and off-street loading areas shall comply with the screening requirements for such areas set forth in subchapter 77-504F.1. 
7.  Location. To the maximum extent feasible, loading areas shall be located to the rear of a site and/or away from adjacent residential areas. 
8.  Signs. The owners of the property shall provide, locate, and maintain loading signs as specified by the director of planning. Such signs shall not be counted against allowed advertising sign area. 
F.  Computation of parking and loading requirements. 
1.  Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number. 
2.  Multiple uses. Lots containing more than one use shall provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses. Where there is determined to be a mix of uses within the same space occupied by the use, the director of planning may calculate the parking requirement of the total of use using the appropriate category for individual uses, such as warehousing within a retail use, retail within a warehouse use, office within a retail use, etc. In making such determination, the director shall require a detailed floor plan. 
3.  Area measurements. Unless otherwise specified, where parking is determined by square footage of the use, the director of planning shall calculate parking requirements based on net square footage of a use, such as deleting atriums, large hallways, bathrooms, etc. from a square footage calculation. In making such determination, the director shall require a detailed floor plan. Structured parking within or part of a building shall not be counted in such measurement. 
4.  Computation of off-street parking. Required off-street loading space shall not be included as off-street parking space in computation of required off-street parking space. 
5.  Parking for unlisted uses. Parking requirements for uses not specifically listed in Table 5-6.1 shall be determined by the director of planning based on the requirements for the closest comparable use, as well as on the particular parking demand and trip generation characteristics of the proposed use. The director of planning may alternately require the submittal of a parking demand study that justifies estimates of parking demand based on the recommendations of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, and includes relevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use in terms of density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.

(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 012-08, §§ 11, 21, 4-1-2008; Ord. No. 016-09, §§ 17, 18, 6-2-2009; Ord. No. 013-13, § 12, 5-21-2013) 
Sec. 77-507. - Public/institutional and commercial building standards. 
A.  Purpose. This section is intended to promote high-quality non-residential building design, encourage visual variety in non-residential areas of the city, foster a more human scale and attractive street fronts, project a positive image to encourage economic development in the city, and protect property values of both the subject property and surrounding areas. In addition, this section intends to create a distinct image for important or highly visible areas of the city in order to enhance the public image of the city and encourage high quality economic development. 
B.  Applicability . Development of any structure that will contain a use categorized in table 3-1, table of allowed uses, as a public or institutional, commercial or an industrial or manufacturing use shall comply with the standards of this section. 
C.  Standards for all public/institutional and commercial structures. 
1.  Facade plan required. 
(a)  A colored facade plan showing the plan view and elevation view shall be made a part of the development plan approval process. 
(b)  The colored facade plan shall include notes listing all material types, finishes, and colors for all exterior elements. 
2.  Building materials. The following standards apply to all development subject to this section. Other exterior materials may be allowed by recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and approval of the city council. 
(a)  Buildings shall be 100 percent masonry construction per elevation, exclusive of roofs, doors, and windows. 
(b)  A minimum 20 percent of each elevation's masonry requirement shall incorporate accent bricks or stones. If accent bricks or stones are used to accent windows, doorways, porticos, porte cocheres, canopies, awnings, or support structures, such application shall only satisfy a maximum of one-half of the required 20 percent per elevation. As the term is used in this subsection, an "accent brick or stone" is one that provides a contrast by color of the natural material or stucco, shape, size, and/or texture to the field or primary bricks or stones in an elevation. 
(c)  All columns and any structural support for any site element shall receive the same masonry treatment as the primary structure, except where cast stone or masonry columns are proposed as part of the design feature. 
(d)  Concrete panel construction shall have brick or stone inset into the face with contrasting mortar joints. Painted, fluted, exposed aggregate, or other architectural concrete finish shall be considered an alternative material and shall first receive a recommendation from the commission, followed by consideration of and approval by the city council. A stucco finish meeting ASTM standards with a minimum thickness of three-quarter inches may be incorporated into the overall design. Flat or untextured concrete finishes are not allowed. 
(e)  Wood exterior elevations and architectural elements may be approved for restaurants and retail structures by recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and approval of the city council. 
(f)  Where concrete masonry units (CMU) are proposed, only those with random indentations, such as split-faced, of at least one-half inch throughout the brick face shall be allowed. 
(g)  Painted, coated or stained brick, stone, or concrete masonry units may be considered by recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and approval of the city council. 
(h)  In areas zoned as light manufacturing (M-1) or general manufacturing (M-2), and for uses classified as industrial or manufacturing in table 3-1 (table of allowed uses), the following standards apply: 
i.  Building exteriors shall be of non-combustible materials including, tilt-up wall construction, stone, brick, tile, cast or cultured stone, painted, coated or stained brick, stone, concrete masonry units, or stucco meeting American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards with a minimum thickness of three-quarter inches. Concrete panel construction shall have brick or stone inset into the face with contrasting mortar joints. Where concrete masonry units (CMU) are proposed, only those with random indentations, such as split-faced, of at least one-half inch throughout the brick face shall be allowed. Metal building systems are not allowed. 
ii.  Any facade adjacent to a public right of way, residential development, or public open space must be at minimum 60 percent masonry brick or stone construction, exclusive of roofs, doors, and windows. 
3.  Building orientation.

(l)  Additional Provisions for In MU-WF District-Waterfront Area. 
(1)  General character. The MU-WF district includes those areas of Rowlett where there are opportunities for commercial and institutional development that taking advantage of views of Lake Ray Hubbard, and where high quality development can enhance the image of the city when viewed across the lake. To maximize those opportunities, it is important to promote and protect views across the lake from many areas within the MU-WF district. In addition, since some sites are constrained by close proximity to single-family and two family areas, it is important that adverse impacts on those areas be avoided. 
(2)  Protecting views of the lake. All development in the MU-WF shall be sited, organized, and oriented to protect views of the lake for both the subject property and for properties in the MU-WF district located further from the lake. Development shall not be permitted to block view of the lake from other property in the district unless there is no alternative development site available on the property. 
(3)  Protecting views from the lake. Service areas, loading docks, and parking areas shall not be located between Lake Ray Hubbard and any facade of any primary building facing Lake Ray Hubbard. 
(4)  Protecting neighborhoods. In addition to meeting the requirements for stepping down building heights set forth in subchapter 77-402 development in the MU-WF area shall be designed to avoid locating loading docs, service areas, or parking lots between primary buildings and any adjacent single-family or two-family zone districts. On lots or tracts of land adjacent to such residential areas, service areas and loading docs, and parking lots shall be internalized in the primary building, if possible, or located on sides of primary buildings that face neither the neighborhoods nor Lake Ray Hubbard, if possible. In some cases, the best way to protect views and neighborhoods at the same time will be to arrange primary buildings so that service areas, loading docks, or parking areas are located on the north or south sides of such buildings.

Sec. 77-509. - Neighborhood protection standards. 
A.  Purpose and relationship to other requirements. This section provides a transition between non-residential and residential uses, through discretionary approval criteria that may be applied in combination with other development standards in this Chapter 77-500 in order to provide significantly more protection for neighborhoods from the impacts of adjacent development. This section makes available a menu of additional tools to use in discretionary approvals to protect residential neighborhoods from potential adverse impacts of adjacent non-residential uses, including limitations on hours of operation, noise, and lighting. 
B.  General conditions. As a condition of the approval of any conditional use permit or specific use permit for any nonresidential use located in or within 300 feet of any residential district, the decision-making body shall be authorized to impose conditions that are necessary to reduce or minimize any potential adverse impacts on residential property. Such conditions may include but are not limited to the following: 
1.  Hours of operation and deliveries; 
2.  Location on a site of activities that generate potential adverse impacts on adjacent uses, such as noise and glare; 
3.  Placement of trash receptacles, compactors, or recycling;

7.  Additional landscaping and screening to mitigate adverse impacts; 
8.  Height restrictions to preserve light and privacy and views of significant features from public property and rights of way; 
9.  Preservation of natural lighting and solar access; 
10.  Ventilation and control of odors and fumes; and 
11.  The control of dust by the installation of landscaping or paving. 
C.  Determination of incompatibility. The decision-making body may issue a determination that the land use proposed is incompatible with adjacent land uses, incompatible with the transportation corridor, or that it is not in keeping with the goals of the city. 
D.  Height and setbacks. Any non-residential structure that is located in a commercial or industrial zoning district and within 100 feet of a property boundary with a residential zoning district shall be set back from the residential boundary a minimum distance equal to the height of the non-residential structure. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 016-09, § 20, 6-2-2009) 
Sec. 77-510. - Exterior lighting. 
A.  Purpose. The general purpose of this section is to require outdoor lighting that is adequate for safety and convenience; in scale with the activity to be illuminated and its surroundings; directed to the surface or activity to be illuminated; and designed to clearly render people and objects and contribute to a pleasant nighttime environment. Additional specific purposes are to: 
1.  Provide safety and personal security as well as convenience and utility in areas of public use or traverse, for uses where there is outdoor public activity during hours of darkness; 
2.  Control glare and excessive brightness to improve visual performance, allow better visibility with relatively less light, and protect residents from nuisance and discomfort; 
3.  Control trespass light onto neighboring properties to protect inhabitants from the consequences of stray light shining in inhabitants' eyes or onto neighboring properties; 
4.  Result in cost and energy savings to establishments by carefully directing light at the surface area or activity to be illuminated, using only the amount of light necessary; and 
5.  Control light pollution to minimize the negative effects of misdirected light and recapture views to the night sky. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  General. All exterior lighting for any type of residential or nonresidential development shall comply with the standards of this section, unless exempted in below. 
(a)  Lighting plan requirement. All nonresidential developments shall submit a proposed exterior lighting plan. The plan must be submitted concurrently with the site plan or subdivision application. The exterior lighting plan shall include plans and specifications for streetlights, parking lot lights, and exterior building lights. The specifications shall include details of the pole, fixture height and design, lamp type, wattage, and spacing of lights. 
(b)  Exempt lighting. The following types of lighting are exempt from the requirements of this section. 
(1)  Soffit or wall-mounted luminaries that are permanently attached to single-family residential dwellings, not to exceed the height of the eave, and that do not produce glare onto adjacent properties or public streets. 
(2)  Public street and right-of-way lighting. 
(3)  Temporary decorative seasonal lighting provided that individual lamps have a light output of 200 lumens or less. 
(4)  Temporary lighting for emergency or nighttime work and construction. 
(5)  Temporary lighting for theatrical, television, and performance areas, or for authorized special events. 
(6)  Lighting for a special district, street, or building that, according to an adopted municipal plan or ordinance, is determined to require special lighting aesthetics as part of its physical character. 
(7)  Lighting required and regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(8)  Internally illuminated signs. 
(9)  Lighting for outdoor recreational uses such as ball diamonds, playing fields, tennis courts, and similar uses, provided that such uses comply with the following standards: 
i.  Maximum permitted light post height: 80 feet. 
ii.  Maximum permitted illumination at the property line: two footcandles. 
iii.  Limits on hours of illumination: Exterior lighting shall be extinguished no later than 11:00 p.m. A waiver or deviation from this requirement may be granted by the city council. 
(c)  General review standard. If installed, all exterior lighting shall meet the functional security needs of the proposed land use without adversely affecting adjacent properties or the community. For purposes of this section, properties that comply with the design and height standards set forth in (d) and (e) below shall be deemed to not adversely affect adjacent properties or the community. 
(d)  Design standards. Exterior lighting is not required except for purposes of public safety. However, if installed, all exterior lighting shall meet the following design standards: 
(1)  Light sources shall be concealed or shielded with luminaries with shielding, skirts, or cut-offs with an angle not exceeding 90 degrees to minimize the potential for glare and unnecessary diffusion on adjacent property. For purposes of this provision, "cutoff angle" is defined as the angle formed by a line drawn from the direction of light rays at the light source or reflector, and a line perpendicular to the ground from the light source above from which no light is emitted. [Illustration needed.] 
(2)  Parking lots and other background spaces shall be illuminated as unobtrusively as possible while meeting the functional needs of safe circulation and protection of people and property. Foreground spaces, such as building entrances and outside seating areas, shall utilize local lighting that defines the space without glare. Floodlights shall not be utilized to light all or any portion of a building facade after normal business hours, except that if the seating area of a restaurant is closed and a drive-through remains open, the business shall be determined as open. 
(3)  The style of light standards and fixtures shall be consistent with the style and character of architecture proposed on the site. 
(4)  In no case shall exterior lighting add more than one footcandle to illumination levels at any point off-site. [Illustration needed.] 
(5)  All outdoor light not necessary for security purposes shall be reduced, activated by motion sensor detectors, or turned off during non-operating hours. 
(6)  Light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statues, or any other objects mounted on a pole, pedestal, or platform shall use a narrow cone beam of light that will not extend beyond the illuminated object. 
(7)  For upward-directed architectural, landscape, and decorative lighting, direct light emissions shall not be visible above the building roof line. 
(8)  No flickering or flashing lights shall be permitted, except for temporary decorative seasonal lighting. 
(e)  Height standards for lighting. 
(1)  In MU-DT, MU-TR, and MU-TS Districts-Downtown. All exterior lighting luminaries shall be mounted no higher than 15 feet. 
(2)  In C-2 District-Lakeview Parkway Corridor. All exterior lighting luminaries shall be mounted no higher than 15 feet, except that lighting in parking lots containing more than 100 spaces shall have a maximum height of 25 feet.

(f)  Pole signs. 
C.  Measurement standards. 
1.  Sign area. For the purposes of this section, sign area shall be measured as follows: 
(a)  Square or rectangular signs shall be measure as the length times the height of the sign (Figure 5.12-1). 

Figure 5.12-1
(b)  Irregular shaped signs shall be measured as the sum of the areas of rectangles, triangles, circles, or combination thereof necessary to enclose the sign face (Figure 5.12-2). 

Figure 5.12-2
(c)  Signs composed of individual cutout letters or figures shall be measured as the sum of areas of rectangles, triangles, circles, or combination thereof necessary to enclose the letters or figures (Figure 5.12-3). 

Figure 5.12-3
(d)  Three dimensional signs shall be measured based on the rectangle or square shape that can be used to form a cube around the sign. The sign area shall be the sum of the four sides perpendicular to the ground divided by two (Figure 5.12-4). 

Figure 5.12-4
(e)  For double-faced signs with less than 18 inches between faces, and less than a 30-degree interior angle between faces, only one side shall be counted as the total area. Where the faces are not equal in size, the larger sign face shall be used as the basis for calculating sign area (Figure 5.12-5). 

Figure 5.12-5
2.  Sign height. Sign height shall be measured as follows: 
(a)  When measuring sign height, the height of the entire structure, including decorative and structural elements must be included.

(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-602. - Applicability. 
A.  Chapter provisions authorized. Unless exempted by subchapter 77-602B., provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision and re-subdivision of land within the City of Rowlett and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, as authorized by the Texas Local Government Code, Chapters 42, 43, and 212, as amended. 
B.  Exemptions. The standards of this chapter shall not apply to any of the following activity unless such activity involves an extension of municipal utilities that includes storm water facilities; there is proposed activity on the property that requires a building permit for new construction or substantial remodeling as determined by the director of planning or as required or excepted under this Code; or where there is proposed access from a public street designated as a collector street or higher on the master thoroughfare plan as amended: 
1.  Creation or realignment of an easement; and 
2.  Adjustment of the boundary line or the transfer of land between two adjacent property owners that does not result in the creation of any additional parcels; 
C.  Minor subdivisions. A subdivision that involves the creation of four or fewer lots shall be classified as a "minor subdivision." 
1.  When a minor subdivision involves no dedication for streets, easements, or other public uses, it may be approved by the director of planning and director of public works subject to the procedures set forth in subchapter 77-806F., Minor subdivisions, of this Code. 
2.  When a minor subdivision involves a street, easement, or other public dedication, the requirement for a preliminary plat may be waived with the approval of the director of planning and director of public works; however, all review and submittal requirements for a final plat shall be satisfied. In the event that the preliminary plat requirement is waived for a minor subdivision, the final plat shall be referred to the city council for the sole purpose of acceptance by the council of the public dedication, and the director of planning shall be responsible for review and approval of all other elements of the final plat subject to the procedures set forth in subchapter 77-805 of this Code. 
D.  Limitation on conditions. 
1.  In approving subdivisions, the director of planning shall be authorized to impose such conditions upon the premises as may be necessary to carry out the general purpose and intent of the Land Development Code. Any conditions imposed on a development approval shall be based upon adopted standards that are: (a) contained in this Code, adopted plan or other document adopted by the city, and (b) sufficiently specific to ensure that the condition is imposed in a consistent and rational manner. Under no circumstance shall these provisions be interpreted to waive any responsibility to the public in the enforcement of provisions contained herein, where such conditions are necessary to protect public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2.  Any condition imposed on a development approval that would require the applicant to dedicate real property to the public or to pay money to the public in an amount that is determined on an individual and discretionary basis shall only be imposed if: (a) there is an essential nexus between the dedication or payment and a legitimate local government interest; and (b) the dedication or payment is roughly proportional both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed use or development of such property. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-603. - Design standards. 
A.  General design standards are minimum standards. The design standards in this section are minimum standards. The city may impose more restrictive standards when it finds they are necessary to conform to the design of a proposed subdivision addressing sound engineering or design standards or other standards in this Code. 
B.  Layout and design generally. No subdivision shall be approved unless it complies with all of the following standards: 
1.  Compliance with other provisions of this title. All subdivisions shall comply with all other applicable zoning, design, and development regulations set forth in this title, including but not limited to: 
(a)  The requirements of the zoning district in which the property is located (see Chapter 77-200); 
(b)  The requirements relevant to specific uses (see Chapter 77-300); and 
(c)  Generally applicable development and design standards (see Chapter 77-500). 
C.  Streets. All streets shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 77-505, Transportation and connectivity, and in addition shall comply with the following standards: 
1.  Compliance with thoroughfare plan. 
(a)  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and general location of all streets shall meet requirements of the city thoroughfare plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. Reserve strips of land controlling access to or egress from other property, or to or from any street or alley, or having the effect of restricting or damaging the adjoining property for subdivision purposes that will not be taxable or assessable for special improvements, shall not be permitted in any subdivision. 
(b)  When such a street is not on the thoroughfare plan, the arrangement of streets in subdivisions shall either: 
(1)  Provide for the continuation or appropriate protection of existing streets in surrounding areas; or 
(2)  Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformity to existing streets impracticable. 
2.  Compliance with city specifications required. All new streets dedicated within a subdivision shall be constructed in accordance with the standard details and construction specifications of the city at the time at which the final plat is approved. 
3.  Street intersections. Unless otherwise approved by the city, major thoroughfare intersections shall be at 90-degree angles. Other street intersections shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect at less than 70 degrees. 
4.  Street right-of-way widths. Street right-of-way widths within the proposed subdivision, or boundary streets impacted by the proposed subdivision, shall be as shown on the thoroughfare plan. Those not so indicated on the Thoroughfare Plan shall be as follows: 
(a)  Minor streets in apartment, commercial or manufacturing areas: 60 feet. Minor streets in rural and estate subdivisions: minimum 60 feet, greater if required for drainage. 
(b)  Residential minor streets: 60 feet. A residential minor street shall be connected to a secondary thoroughfare (type B+). 
(c)  Local residential street: A local residential street may be considered and permitted by the Commission, but only after an affirmative recommendation from the department of public works. 
(d)  Right-of-way widths for approaches of major and secondary thoroughfares shall provide for the following minimum: 
i.  Half the median width. 
ii.  Two ten-foot left-turn lanes. 
iii.  Continuation of the through lanes. 
iv.  One ten-foot free right-turn lane. 
5.  Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision, conforming with other requirements of this Code, where the city has determined through a traffic study that it is practical to require the dedication of one half of the street when the property adjoining the street is subdivided. Whenever a partial street exists along a common property line, the other portion of the street shall be dedicated upon a finding through a traffic study that traffic generated by the proposed development warrants such dedication. Half streets shall only be considered on four-lane (or wider) divided roadways. Four-lane half streets without a median shall not be accepted. Where part of a street is being dedicated along a common property line, the ultimate planned width shall be as shown on the thoroughfare plan. Dedication and construction will include one-half of the ultimate planned right-of-way, pavement, and the entire median width. 
6.  Culs-de-sac. 
(a)  Local residential streets. Unless otherwise approved by the planning and zoning commission, a cul-de-sac on a local residential street shall not be longer than 600 feet and at the closed end shall have a turnaround provided for, having a right-of-way radius of at least 50 feet and a right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. The cul-de-sac shall be measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the centerline of the cul-de-sac turnaround. 
(b)  Local commercial streets. Unless otherwise approved by the planning and zoning commission, a cul-de-sac on a local commercial street shall not be longer than 900 feet and at the closed end shall have a turnaround provided for, having a right-of-way radius of at least 100 feet and a right-of-way diameter of at least 200 feet. The cul-de-sac shall be measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the centerline of the cul-de-sac turnaround. 
7.  Driveways. Driveways shall comply with the standards in Chapter 77-505E., Access management and driveway standards. 
8.  Intersection off-sets. The number of minor or local street off-sets shall be minimized, and shall be approved by the city engineer. When approved, the off-set shall not be less than 150 feet on centerlines. No off-sets shall be permitted at the intersection of collector or arterial streets. 
9.  Street names. 
(a)  New streets that are an extension of existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets they are extending and shall be dedicated at equal or greater widths than the existing streets unless otherwise indicated on the Thoroughfare Plan. No new street names shall be used that will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the director of planning and fire marshal. 
(b)  Street names shall be approved consistent with nationally recognized standards and the public health, safety and welfare. 
(c)  A master list of street names shall be maintained in the office of the fire marshal and shall be available for distribution or review by developers or citizens. 
(d)  All street names shall be designated on and approved by the final plat. 
10.  Residential minor streets.

(a)  Where alleys are required, alleys in residential districts shall provide a minimum of 20 feet of right-of-way and 12 feet of pavement. 
(b)  Alleys shall be paved in accordance with city construction details and specifications in effect at the time at which the final plat was approved. 
(c)  Where the deflection of alley alignment exceeds 30 degrees, a cutback of a minimum 15 feet or of such greater distance to provide safe vehicular movement shall be established on the inside property line, and the paving of the alley shall be cutback in the same manner. 
(d)  Dead-end alleys are prohibited. 
(e)  Garage driveway connections shall be from an alley. In areas where no alley is required, garage driveway connection shall be from the street. 
(f)  No auxiliary driveway shall be installed to connect from a street or front driveway to an alley or rear driveway along an interior lot line. 
(g)  No single-family or two-family residential lot shall be accessed from an arterial classed or greater thoroughfare. The board of adjustment may approve a variance to this standard when no practical alternative exists as verified by the city engineer. 
(h)  Alleys may not exceed a maximum length of 800 feet unless approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
E.  Blocks. 
1.  Blocks shall be determined based on: 
(a)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the needs of the types of uses contemplated; 
(b)  Meeting the lot size, setback, and other dimensional requirements set forth in Chapter 77-400 or as otherwise approved by the planning and zoning commission; and 
(c)  Consideration of needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic. 
2.  In existing subdivisions, new blocks shall be designed, and intersections shall be provided, so to serve cross-traffic adequately and to match existing street patterns or follow practices already established in the subdivision. 
3.  In new subdivisions, block lengths shall be no greater than 1,200 feet. In cases where physical barriers or property ownership creates conditions where it is appropriate that these standards be varied, the length may be increased or decreased to meet the existing conditions having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of traffic, and public safety. Such increases or decreases are subject to the review and recommendation of the city staff with final approval by the planning and zoning commission. 
F.  Lots. 
1.  General lot requirements. 
(a)  Lots shall conform to the minimum requirements of the established zoning district. 
(b)  Each lot shall face on a dedicated public or private street. Unless otherwise provided by this Code, lots shall have a minimum of 35 feet of frontage along a dedicated street with the minimum lot width established at the building limit line. 
(c)  The planning and zoning commission may permit direct access onto a major thoroughfare for single-family residential lots with a lot frontage width of 300 feet or greater when no practical alternative exists as verified by the city engineer. To the greatest extent practical, as determined by the director of planning, side lot lines should be at right angles or radial to street lines. 
(d)  Unless otherwise provided by this Code, no lot shall be replatted to reduce the size of the lots originally platted within a subdivision, unless property owners within 200 feet have been notified in writing at least ten days prior to a hearing by the planning and zoning commission. 
(e)  When an applicant exhibits a duly executed and recorded deed covering a lot having been sold by metes and bounds prior to October 26, 1961, and such lot is being assessed for city taxes and conforms to the established lot pattern and zoning classification in the block where located, then a building permit may be issued, provided that the requested use of such property conforms to the permanent zoning of the property covered by the application. 
(f)  No lot shall be platted by any preliminary or final subdivision plat in such a manner that a dividing line between two counties, municipalities, or school districts will be created. 
(g)  With the exception of a lot backing to an area designated as the take area, and following passage of this ordinance, no lot shall back to a public park unless approved by the planning and zoning commission.

(a)  Allowed districts. Unless otherwise allowed by the board of adjustment, flag lots shall be allowed only in the residential zoning districts. 
(b)  Frontage. Each flag lot shall have at least 35 feet of street frontage and at least 35 feet of width for the entire length of the "flagpole." 
(c)  Lot area calculation. The area of the "flagpole" portion of the lot shall not be included in the calculation of the minimum lot area. 
(d)  Driveways. Driveways shall be designed to allow vehicles to drive out forward. Shared or common driveways/parking will be considered when two flag lots are contiguous. 
G.  Building lines. Front building lines shall be shown on the final plat of all lots and shall meet the minimum setback requirements of the applicable zoning district, as set forth in Chapter 77-400 
H.  Underground utilities. It is the intent of this provision that all utility lines be buried so as to reduce disruption to service in the event of a natural disaster or unforeseen accident; to enhance the aesthetics along transportation corridors, and to reduce bodily injury in the event of a vehicle accident. 
1.  Unless a waiver is authorized by the city council, all electrical, telephone, and cable TV utility (lateral and/or service distribution) lines and wires including, but not limited to, street lighting and traffic signal, to be placed underground. All such lines within a right-of-way or otherwise between property lines shall also be buried. Feeder and other major transmission lines associated with towers may remain overhead. 
2.  All utility installation shall conform to the right-way-management ordinance. 
3.  All electrical and telephone support equipment, including transformers, amplifiers, and switching devices necessary for underground installations, shall be pad-mounted and located adjacent to the side property lines. To mitigate adverse impacts to storm water drainage to the greatest extent possible, the location shall be approved by the city engineer. 
4.  Unless otherwise required herein, all utility boxes, poles, and meters that are within 50 feet of the entryway of a subdivision landscaping shall be placed behind the screening wall in the utility easement. 
5.  Temporary construction service may be provided by overhead electric lines and facilities without obtaining a waiver from city council, provided that when the underground utility service to any portion of subdivision is completed, such overhead electric lines and facilities are promptly removed. 
6.  All installations regulated by this section shall also conform to the standards for utility construction currently in effect in the city. 
7.  Standards contained herein shall apply to the redevelopment of properties, or those situations where a pad site is proposed within a development, or where there is an expansion of a structure or property of 25 percent or greater. 
I.  Standards for utility construction. The sanitary sewers, storm sewers, water mains, and street improvements, with all appurtenances pertaining to the same and facilities of other agencies as may be required, shall be constructed and installed in each new subdivision in accordance with current construction details and specifications of the city at the time the final plat is approved, or as may be required in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 016-09, §§ 23, 24, 6-2-2009) 
Sec. 77-604. - Required improvements. 
A.  Survey monuments. 
1.  Survey monuments shall be placed at all lot corners. 
2.  At least two concrete monuments shall be installed in a subdivision that have certified horizontal and vertical positioning in state plane coordinates, and must be intervisible with each other. These monuments shall be coordinated and verified with the city's geodetic monuments. The survey monument information shall be submitted with the as-built plans before a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
B.  Streetlights. The developer shall be responsible for streetlight installation. Before final acceptance of streets, alleys, sewers, and other utilities, the developer shall coordinate streetlight locations and installations with the power company and the city. 
C.  Street and alley improvements. 
1.  Before approval and acceptance of any final plat, the developer shall prepare, or have prepared, and submit complete engineering plans of streets, alleys, storm sewers and drainage structures, and water and sanitary sewer improvements for the area covered by the final plat of a number and in a form as required by the director of public works. The developer shall have these plans prepared by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Texas. 
2.  The director of public works shall review or cause to be reviewed the plans and specifications and, if approved, shall mark them approved and return one set to the developer. If not approved, two sets shall be marked with the objections noted and returned to the developer for correction. After approval of the plat, plans, and specifications by the city, the developer shall cause his contractor to install the facilities in accordance with the approved plans and standard specifications of the city and at the developer's expense. 
3.  The developer shall cause his engineer to design, stake, and supervise the construction of such improvements and shall cause his contractor to construct the improvements in accordance with the regulations of this division. The city will inspect the installation of the improvements. When found to be installed in accordance with the plans and specifications, and after the improvements have been completed, and upon receipt by the city of a two-year maintenance bond or certificate of deposit from each separate contractor in the amount of 20 percent of the contract price, along with three sets of as-built plans, one set of as-built mylars, and one set of plans in digital format in a format as required by the city, the plans and mylars to be as-built and upon receipt of a letter of the contractor's compliance with these regulations, then the city administrative official shall receive and approve for the city the title, use, and maintenance of the improvements. 
4.  The minimum street and alley construction standards shall be determined by the city. 
5.  Curb ramps for barrier-free access shall be constructed to comply with Texas Accessibility Standards and city standards. 
6.  The developer shall provide additional right-of-way required for existing or future streets as shown in the thoroughfare plan or other plan approved by the city council. 
7.  When a proposed subdivision of land abuts an existing road that does not meet the city's standard specifications, and where the development of land proposed is such that accelerated wear or deterioration will result from and be contributed by the development, the developer shall be required to improve the existing road, including sidewalks, to bring the same to city standards. Such requirement is conditioned upon a determination, based upon a traffic study as required by the city engineer, that the improvements are related to, necessitated by, and proportional to the development being proposed. 
8.  The city may allow the developer to pay into escrow by cash or irrevocable letter of credit an amount equal to 115 percent of the developer's share of the cost of such improvements as a condition to the approval of the final plat. The amount of escrow shall be as determined by the city engineer. 
9.  When funds have been provided and placed in escrow with the city for the development of a substandard road, and the road is reconstructed by a party other than the escrowing developer and at no cost to the city, the escrowed funds shall be refunded to the developer after completion and acceptance of the improvements, with the city retaining one-half of any interest earned to cover administrative expenses. If a portion of the cost is borne by the city, the difference between the developer's proportionate cost and the escrowed funds shall be refunded to the developer after completion and acceptance of the improvements. 
10.  All new roads within proposed subdivisions shall, at a minimum, be built to a width and design in accordance with the thoroughfare plan or as otherwise required under this Code. 
11.  Streets that dead end at power lines, railroads, or similar rights-of-way, and that are intended for future extension across these rights-of-way, where plans and approvals have been made by the owners of such rights-of-way, shall be constructed in right-of-way for half the distance across the rights-of-way; provided, however, that the street is not a dead-end and is provided with an approved cul-de-sac. A Type III barricade shall be constructed at the end of the dead-end street. 
12.  Where streets are adjacent to undeveloped land and the property line is normally the centerline of the street, the developer shall provide a right-of-way of sufficient width and shall construct paving a minimum width of half the requirements for that particular street. Such requirement is conditioned upon a determination that the improvements are related to, necessitated by, and proportional to the development being proposed. 
13.  When it has been determined by the city that it is not feasible to construct the street and/or railroad crossing at the time of development of the subdivision, escrow for the developer's portion of the cost may be provided in accordance with this section. If the street and/or railroad crossing has been constructed or is being constructed by others, the developer shall pay his pro rata share of the improvements in accordance with Ordinance No. 6-3-86B. Escrow or pro rata shall be payable prior to construction of streets and utilities. 
14.  When reimbursing the developer for oversize development costs, the city shall pay a maximum engineering fee of six percent of the construction reimbursement. 
15.  If the improvements of such road or street do not occur within 20 years from the date the money is so placed on deposit with the city, the money shall be returned to the property owner of record at that time. The city shall retain one-half of the interest earned to cover administrative costs. 
16.  Where, in its judgment, the public convenience and welfare will be substantially served and the appropriate use of the neighboring property will not be substantially injured, upon recommendation by the director of public works, the board of adjustment may, in specific cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, authorize a variance to the regulations of this section. Such variances will only be made in order to permit reasonable development and improvement of property if (1) the literal enforcement of such regulations would cause an unnecessary hardship or (2) the design, density/intensity, alteration or access to or from the proposed subdivision indicates that standard enforcement of such regulations would violate legal constraints relating to "rough proportionality" in land dedication or related costs. 
D.  Street signs. Within the corporate limits of the city and extraterritorial jurisdiction, street signs shall be installed at each intersection. The subdivider shall pay to the city charges as determined by the department of public works to defray the cost of materials and installation of such sign. At the city's option, the subdivider shall be required to install such street signs at its sole expense. Such signs shall be of a type approved by the city and shall be installed in accordance with the standards of the city. The developer shall pay such sum at the time a final plat is submitted for approval, and this sum shall be in addition to any other fees and charges as may be established pursuant to this chapter. 
E.  Traffic control devices. Within the corporate limits of the city and extraterritorial jurisdiction, traffic control devices related to the impact of the development shall be installed by the city at the expense of the subdivider as required by the city at each intersection. The subdivider shall pay to the city charges as determined by the department of public works to defray the cost of materials and installation of such device(s). The developer shall pay such sum at the time a final plat is submitted for approval, and this sum shall be in addition to any other fees and charges as may be established pursuant to this chapter. At the city's option, the subdivider shall be required to install such devices at its sole expense. Such devices shall be of a type approved by the city and shall be installed in accordance with the standards of the city by the developer. 
F.  Storm drainage. 
1.  An adequate storm sewer system consisting of inlets, pipes, and other underground structures with approved outlets shall be constructed where runoff of stormwater and the prevention of erosion cannot be accomplished satisfactorily by surface drainage facilities. Areas subject to flood conditions as established by FEMA or the city will not be considered for development until adequate provisions of the drainage and stormwater control ordinance have been met. 
2.  The criteria for use in designing storm sewers, culverts, bridges, drainage channels, and drainage facilities shall conform to the provisions of this Code. 
G.  Water and sanitary sewer system improvements. All subdivisions shall be provided with an approved water and sanitary sewer system designed and constructed in accordance with the comprehensive plan and the city's standard construction details and construction specifications. In the corporate limits of the city, all subdivisions shall be connected with the city water supply distribution system and sanitary sewer systems. The developer shall furnish and install all complete water systems including water mains, valves, water sampling stations, and fire hydrants. The developer shall furnish and install all complete sanitary sewer systems including sewer mains, manholes, and cleanouts. 
H.  Permission required for alterations to drainageways. No individual, partnership, firm, or corporation shall deepen, widen, fill, reroute, or change the course or location of any existing ditch, channel, stream, or drainageway, without first obtaining written permission of the city or other agency having jurisdiction. 
I.  Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). An SWPPP shall be required and shall be submitted to the city with civil plans before the civil plans are released for construction. 
J.  Public acceptance. The city shall not accept any public improvements until after all franchise utilities are installed.

1.  Unless otherwise approved as a private street, all street rights-of-way shall be dedicated to the public in fee simple. 
2.  The city council may approve the dedication of a half-street only when the other half of the street has been dedicated or when the city council reasonably anticipates that the other half of the street will be dedicated. When a subdivision borders a dedicated half street, the city council shall require the dedication of the other half of the street, unless it determines that the street would be unnecessary or undesirable. 
D.  Alleys. The city council may require the dedication of alley rights-of-way in fee simple where it finds that alleys are necessary for service access, off-street loading, or parking. 
E.  Walkways. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities shall be dedicated and constructed in accordance with the thoroughfare plan. 
F.  Easements. 
1.  When required. Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be of such widths as may be reasonably necessary for the utilities using the same. It shall be the subdivider's responsibility to determine appropriate easement widths as required by utility companies.

1.  Required wording on each private street development plat. Each private street development plat shall contain the following wording on the face of the final plat: "The streets have not been dedicated to the public, for public access nor have they been accepted by the city, as public improvements, and the streets and roadways shall be maintained by the homeowner's association within the subdivision, except that the streets and roadways shall always be open to authorized emergency vehicles, public and private utility maintenance and service personnel, solid waste collection services, the U.S. Postal Service, and government employees in pursuit of their official duties." 
2.  Private access permit. All private access permits shall be issued prior to the approval of the final plat.

The cost of such appraisal shall be borne by the applicants, and the appraiser conclusions of value shall be final. In determining the value of the street rights-of-way, the appraiser shall take into account that the developer of the subdivision constructed the street and not paid for directly by the city, if such were the case. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if at least 60 percent of the applicants object, in writing, prior to the city council's consideration of a resolution of abandonment regarding the appraiser's findings and conclusions of value, the city council may order another appraisal. If another appraisal is not ordered, the city council may consider a resolution of abandonment and issue quitclaim deeds to the record lot owners as to their representative portion of the public rights-of-way. 
(c)  Once the conversion takes place, all of the other provisions of this article shall be applicable to the private street subdivision.

3.  UDC user's guide. The director of planning shall compile the requirements for application contents, forms, fees, and the submission and review schedule in a user's guide, which shall be made available to the public. The user's guide may be updated from time to time. 
4.  Waivers. The director of planning may waive certain submittal requirements in order to tailor the requirements to the information necessary to review a particular application. The director may waive such requirement where he or she finds that the projected size, complexity, anticipated impacts, or other factors associated with the proposed development clearly, in his or her opinion, support such waiver. 
E.  Verification of application completeness. 
(a)  The director of planning shall only initiate the review and processing of any application submitted under this chapter if such application is complete. The director shall make a determination of application completeness. If the application is determined to be complete, the application shall then be processed according to the procedures set forth in this Code.

3.  Mailed notice. When Table 8.3-1 requires that written notice be provided, the director shall deposit such notice into first class mail to property owners within 200 feet of the subject property, not less than 15 days prior to the hearing. In computing such period, the day of mailing shall not be counted, but the day of the hearing shall be counted. Written notice shall be provided to all persons listed on the records of the municipal tax assessor as owners of land subject to the application or as owners of the parcels within 200 feet of the outer boundary of the land subject to the application at the mailing addresses of such persons in the records of the municipal tax assessor. Due to the "super majority" rule under Chapter 211 of the Texas Local Government Code, responses received after an imposed deadline for response shall not be counted in the record of response. 
4.  Published notice. When Table 8.3-1 requires that notice be published, the director shall cause a notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior to the scheduled meeting of the planning and zoning commission, and at least 15 days prior to the scheduled meeting of the city council. In computing such period, the day of publication shall not be counted, but the day of the hearing shall be counted. 
5.  Posted notice. When Table 8.3-1 requires that notice be posted, the applicant shall place a sign on the subject property at least ten days prior to the scheduled meeting of the decision-making body, and the sign shall remain until after the final scheduled meeting regarding the subject application. In computing such period, the day of posting shall not be counted, but the day of the hearing shall be counted. If no part of the subject property is visible from the public right-of-way, the notice shall be posted along the nearest street in the public right-of-way. Posted notices shall include all the content specified in paragraph a. above except for the legal description. Before the hearing, the applicant shall submit to the planning department an affidavit, signed by the person who did the posting or the person who caused the posting to be done, that notice was posted as required by this subsection. A picture of the zoning sign placed on the property shall be provided to the planning department for permanent record. 
6.  Constructive notice. 
(a)  Minor defects in any notice shall not impair the notice or invalidate proceedings pursuant to the notice if a bona fide attempt has been made to comply with applicable notice requirements. Minor defects in notice shall be limited to errors in a legal description, typographical or grammatical errors, or errors of actual acreage that do not impede communication of the notice to affected parties. Failure of a party to receive written notice shall not invalidate subsequent action. In all cases, however, the requirements for the timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date, and place of a hearing shall be strictly construed. If questions arise at the hearing regarding the adequacy of notice, the decision-making body shall direct city staff to make a formal finding as to whether there was substantial compliance with the notice requirements of this Code, and such finding shall be made available to the decision-making body prior to final action on the request. 
(b)  When the records of the city document the publication, mailing, and posting of notices as required by this section, it shall be presumed that notice of a public hearing was given as required by this section. 
G.  Concurrent processing. Where possible without creating an undue administrative burden on the city's decision-making bodies and staff, this Code intends to accommodate the simultaneous processing of applications for different permits and approvals that may be required for the same development project in order to expedite the overall review and approval process. Review and decision-making bodies considering applications submitted simultaneously shall render separate reports, recommendations, and decisions on each application based on the specific standards applicable to each approval. 
1.  Examples of concurrent filing and processing of applications include, but are not limited to: 
(a)  A development plan along with a conditional use permit; 
(b)  A subdivision plat along with a development plan, or plat vacation; 
(c)  A minor modification, waiver or deviation along with a conditional use permit or development plan; and 
(d)  Advertisement of a city council meeting prior to receipt of the final report by the planning and zoning commission. 
2.  Some forms of approval depend on the applicant having previously received another form of approval, or require the applicant to take particular action within some time period following the approval in order to avoid having the approval lapse. Therefore, even though this Code intends to accommodate simultaneous processing, applicants should note that each of the permits and approvals set forth in this Code has its own timing and review sequence. 
3.  The expected time frame and approval process for a consolidated application shall follow the longest time frame and approval process required from among the joined application types. The actual time period for approval depends significantly upon the consultant's familiarity with the city's processes, and the completeness and accuracy of the plans submitted for review. 
4.  The director of planning shall make determinations as to the applicability, need, or progress of an application in deciding whether to initiate concurrent processing. 
H.  Conditions of approval. Some procedures set forth in this Code authorize the decision-making body to impose such conditions upon the premises benefited by the approval as may be necessary to reduce or minimize any potential adverse impact upon other property in the area, or to carry out the general purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan and this Code. In such cases, any conditions attached to approvals shall be directly related to the impacts of the proposed use or development and shall be roughly proportional in both extent and amount to the anticipated impacts of the proposed use or development. No conditions of approval, except for those attached to a waiver, deviation, variance or minor modification approvals, shall be less restrictive than the requirements of this Code. 
I.  Effect of inaction on applications. When a review or decision-making body fails to take action on an application within the time required (which varies by type of application), such inaction shall be deemed a denial of the application, unless the decision-making body agrees to an extension of the time frame. After the passing of the required time period for a tabled application, and where the commission has made no decision on the application and where city council approval is required, the application shall be submitted to the city council. Inaction by the commission under these circumstances shall be deemed as a final report to the governing body as required under Chapter 211 of the Texas Local Government Code. 
J.  Lapse of approval. The lapse of approval time frames established by the procedures of this Code may be extended only when all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  The provisions of this Code must expressly allow the extension; 
2.  An extension request must be filed prior to the applicable lapse-of-approval deadline; 
3.  The extension request must be in writing and include justification; and 
4.  Unless otherwise noted, authority to grant extensions of time shall rest with the decision-making body that granted the original approval (the one being extended). 
K.  Payment of taxes, fees, or other obligations required. 
1.  Payment of indebtedness required prior to hearings. No person who owes delinquent taxes, delinquent paving assessments or any other delinquent debts or obligations, and which are directly attributable to a piece of property or on which an applicant is requesting a hearing, public or otherwise, before the planning and zoning commission, board of adjustment, and/or the city council, shall be granted any such hearing until the taxes, assessments, debts, or obligations directly attributable to such property and owed by the owner or previous owner thereof shall have been first fully discharged by payment, or until an arrangement satisfactory to the city manager has been made for the payment of such debts or obligations. 
2.  Right to deny hearing. Regardless of the status of or indebtedness owed to the city, by the applicant or person requesting such hearing, the requested hearing shall be denied only under the provisions of this chapter if the indebtedness complained of appears to be directly attributable to the property which is to be the subject of the hearing. 
3.  Misrepresentation of facts unlawful. It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly or willfully misrepresent, or fail to include, any information required by this chapter on any application for annexation, zoning, development, improvement, or subdivision of property. 
4.  Penalties. If any applicant for such hearing, or any owner of property subject to such hearing, shall allow such hearing before the planning and zoning commission, the city council and/or the board of adjustment to be heard in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, such person shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a penalty as per chapter 77-1000 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 019-08, § 6, 7-15-2008; Ord. No. 016-09, §§ 29-32, 6-2-2009; Ord. No. 022-14, § 9, 6-3-2014) 
Sec. 77-804. - Amendments to the text of this Code. 
A.  Purpose and scope. The city council may amend the text of this Code in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. The purpose of text amendments is to make adjustments to text that are necessary in light of changed conditions or changes in public policy, or that are necessary to advance the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the city. 
B.  Procedure. 
1.  Filing of applications. Petitions for text amendments shall be filed by or filed with the director of planning in a form established by the director. 
2.  Director review, report, and recommendation. The director of planning shall review each proposed text amendment in light of the approval criteria of subsection C below and distribute the request to other reviewers as deemed necessary. Based on the results of those reviews, the director shall provide a report to the city council during a work session or open session. The city council shall authorize or not authorize the planning and zoning commission to hold the necessary work sessions or take other such action, including public hearings if required under V.T.C.A., Local Government Code Chapter. 211. 
3.  Planning and zoning commission review and report. 
(a)  The planning and zoning commission shall hold a hearing on the proposed text amendment. Following the hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall make a final report to the city council. 
(b)  The director shall draft an ordinance and shall submit an ordinance for consideration to the city council. 
(c)  If no final report is made within 45 days of the planning and zoning commission's hearing, then the commission may request an extension of time from the city council. Such request shall be within the 45-day period. If no final report is made and no extension is granted, the city council may act on the proposed amendment without a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. Failure of the planning and zoning commission to issue a final report to the city council as required under the Texas Local Government Code shall be interpreted as a final report. 
4.  City council action. After reviewing the reports and recommendations of the director of planning and the final report from the planning and zoning commission, the city council shall vote to approve, approve with amendments, or deny the proposed amendment, based on the approval criteria of subsection C below. The city council also may refer the proposed amendment back to the planning and zoning commission or director for further consideration, continue a public hearing, or postpone action on an application for a period not to exceed 90 days. 
C.  Approval criteria. Recommendations or decisions on text amendments shall be based on consideration of all the following criteria: 
1.  Whether the proposed amendment corrects an error or meets the challenge of some changing condition, trend, or fact; 
2.  Whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the comprehensive plan and the stated purposes of this Code; 
3.  Whether the proposed amendment will protect the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the public; 
4.  Whether the proposed amendment will result in significant mitigation of adverse impacts on the natural environment, including air, water, noise, stormwater management, wildlife, and vegetation; and 
5.  Whether the proposed amendment will advance the goals of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-805. - Rezonings. 
A.  Purpose and scope. The boundaries of any zoning district in the city may be changed, or the zone classification of any parcel of land may be changed, pursuant to this section. The purpose is not to relieve particular hardships, nor to confer special privileges or rights on any person, but only to make adjustments to the official zoning map that are necessary in light of changed conditions or changes in public policy, or that are necessary to advance the general welfare of the city. Rezonings should not be used as a way to legitimize nonconforming uses or structures, and should not be used when a waiver, deviation, variance or minor modification could be used to achieve the same result. 
B.  Procedure. 
1.  Initiation. A rezoning may be initiated by the owner of the property to be rezoned or their authorized agent, the city council, the planning and zoning commission, or by the director of any city department. 
2.  Submission requirements. 
(a)  Applicants for a rezoning shall submit the materials specified in the user's guide. Additional materials may be required for certain types of rezonings, as provided below. 
(b)  The planning and zoning commission or the director of planning may require the submission of such other information as may be necessary to permit the informed exercise of judgment under the criteria for the review of a rezoning application, as set out in subsection C below. Such information shall be related to the scale and location of the rezoning application and may include, without limitation, traffic, soil, hydraulic, visual, aesthetic, water, and sewage analyses. 
(c)  A rezoning application shall expire 180 days after submittal unless a public hearing on the application has been held by the city council on or before that date; provided, however, that the director of planning may extend the application for 180 days if the reason for the delay was due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. 
(d)  A rezoning application, together with any required or submitted plans, shall expire after 60 days if the director of planning determines that the application has remained dormant during that period where no activity has occurred toward the completion and/or submittal of the application. At the discretion of the director, the applicant shall be notified that an application has remained dormant, and the applicant will have 30 days to bring the application to a conclusion. Following the 30 day period, and where no activity has occurred during that period, the director shall cause the application to become null and void. Any reactivity of the application will be treated as a new application. 
3.  Public hearings. Published, written, and posted notice of public hearings on rezonings, and associated conditional use permits if applicable, shall be provided in accordance with subchapter 77-803F. In addition, the notice shall list the protest provisions set forth in subsection 7., below. The director of planning also shall mail a notice to all owners of the property within 200 feet to be reclassified, as shown in the current municipal assessor's records. 
4.  Review and report by planning and zoning commission. 
(a)  The planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed rezoning and issue a final report to the city council. The commission may defer its report for not more than 30 days from the time it is posted on the agenda until it has had opportunity to consider other proposed changes that may have a direct bearing on the proposed rezoning. 
(b)  In its review, the commission's recommendations shall be based on the following points: 
(1)  Whether the proposed rezoning corrects an error or meets the challenge of some changing condition, trend, or fact; 
(2)  Whether the proposed rezoning is consistent with the comprehensive plan and the purposes of this Code stated in subchapter 77-103, Purpose of this Code; 
(3)  Whether the proposed rezoning will protect or enhance the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public; 
(4)  Whether the municipality and other service providers will be able to provide sufficient transportation and utility facilities and services to the subject property, while maintaining sufficient levels of service to existing development; 
(5)  Whether the proposed rezoning is likely to have significant adverse impacts on the natural environment, including air, water, noise, stormwater management, wildlife, and vegetation; 
(6)  Whether the proposed rezoning will have significant adverse impacts on other property in the vicinity of the subject tract; 
(7)  The suitability of the subject property for the existing zoning classification and proposed zoning classification; 
(8)  Whether there is determined to be an excessive proliferation of the use or similar uses; 
(9)  Whether the proposed rezoning will ensure that future uses on the subject tract will be compatible in scale with uses on other properties in the vicinity of the subject tract; and 
(10)  The supply of land in the economically relevant area that is in the use district to be applied by the rezoning or in similar use districts, in relation to the demand for that land. 
(c)  The director shall forward the final report from the planning and zoning commission to the city council with an ordinance to amend the official zoning map in accordance with the recommendation. 
5.  Action by city council. The city council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed rezoning and consider the recommendations of the director of planning and the planning and zoning commission, and within 90 days: 
(a)  Approve the rezoning by ordinance; 
(b)  Approve the rezoning by ordinance with modifications, waivers, or deviations; 
(c)  Deny the rezoning; or 
(d)  Refer the proposed rezoning back to the planning and zoning commission, to the director, to a committee of the city council, or to an ad hoc committee for further consideration. 
6.  Findings of fact. Every decision for which a public hearing for a rezoning is required shall be based upon findings of fact, and every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of the proceedings. The approval criteria set forth in subsection C below are limitations on the power of the council and commission to act. 
7.  Protests. Any owner of property subject to a proposed rezoning or affected by a proposed rezoning may protest the rezoning by filing a written protest with the director pursuant to this section within a time specified. 
(a)  The protest shall object to the zoning map amendment, contain a legal description of the property on behalf of which the protest is made, and be signed by the owner of the property. 
(b)  If protests in the form of opposition are received from property owners within 200 feet of the subject property, and the property owners own a combined minimum of 20 percent or more of the land area, approval by the city council shall only occur with a concurring vote of at least three-fourths of the full membership of the city council. 
8.  Successive applications. Following denial of a rezoning request, no new application for the same or substantially the same rezoning shall be accepted within one year of the date of denial unless it is determined by the director that substantial changes are proposed that could affect the outcome of the approval. 
C.  Approval criteria. Recommendations and decisions on rezonings shall be based on consideration of the following criteria: 
1.  Whether the proposed rezoning corrects an error or meets the challenge of some changing condition, trend, or fact; 
2.  Whether the proposed rezoning is consistent with the comprehensive plan and the purposes of this Code stated in subchapter 77-103, Purpose of this Code; 
3.  Whether the proposed rezoning will protect or enhance the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public; 
4.  Whether the municipality and other service providers will be able to provide sufficient transportation and utility facilities and services to the subject property, while maintaining sufficient levels of service to existing development; 
5.  Whether the proposed rezoning is likely to have significant adverse impacts on the natural environment, including air, water, noise, stormwater management, wildlife, and vegetation; 
6.  Whether the proposed rezoning will have significant adverse impacts on other property in the vicinity of the subject tract; 
7.  The suitability of the subject property for the existing zoning classification and proposed zoning classification; 
8.  Whether there is determined to be an excessive proliferation of the use or similar uses; 
9.  Whether the proposed rezoning will ensure that future uses on the subject tract will be compatible in scale with uses on other properties in the vicinity of the subject tract; and 
10.  The supply of land in the economically relevant area that is in the use district to be applied by the rezoning or in similar use districts, in relation to the demand for that land. 
D.  Rezoning to the Planned Development District. 
1.  Applicability. The establishment of a planned development district shall follow the procedure for rezonings set forth in subsection B. above, except as modified in this subsection. A rezoning to the planned development district shall require a recommendation by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city council of a concept plan. 
2.  Concept plan required. The ordinance establishing the planned development district shall include a concept plan prepared in accordance with this section. The concept plan shall be submitted along with the application for rezoning. 
3.  Concept plan contents. 
(a)  A concept plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 
(1)  A list of uses to be allowed within the planned development district by right, and a list of uses to be allowed only with a conditional use permit; 
(2)  A statement that development on the site will meet applicable standards of this Code; 
(3)  As applicable, statements regarding lighting, glare, noise, hours of operation, dust, outdoor storage, outdoor display, and other such details that relate to the operation or function of the use(s) being proposed. 
(b)  The director shall require sufficient detail in the concept plan that will provide an opportunity for the approving bodies to make informed decisions and evaluate compliance with the standards and intent of this Code. 
4.  Written report. When a planned development rezoning is being considered, a written report from the director of planning discussing the impact on planning, engineering, water utilities, electric, sanitation, building inspection, tax, police, fire, and traffic, may be submitted to the planning and zoning commission. 
5.  Placement on official zoning map. All planned development districts approved in accordance with the provisions of this section in its original form, or by subsequent amendments thereto, shall be referenced on the zoning district map, and a list of such planned development districts, together with the category of uses permitted therein, shall be maintained as part of this Code. 
6.  Commencement of development. Development in the approved planned development district shall commence within two years from the approval of the rezoning. If development has not commenced within two years, the director shall initiate a public hearing process to rezone the property back to its prior zoning classification, or in light of other conditions, to another zoning classification. 
7.  Planned development districts adopted prior to this Code shall continue. Prior to adoption of this Code, the city council had established various planned development zoning districts, some of which are to be continued in full force and effect. The planned development ordinances or parts of ordinances approved prior to this chapter shall be carried forth in full force and effect and are the conditions, restrictions, regulations, and requirements that apply to the respective planned development districts shown on the zoning map at the date of adoption. If changes occur in site plans approved prior to adoption of this Code, then the changes shall be approved by the planning and zoning commission and city council. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 012-08, § 22, 4-1-2008; Ord. No. 016-09, §§ 33, 34, 6-2-2009) 
Sec. 77-806. - Platting. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the plat review process is to ensure compliance with the subdivision standards and requirements set forth in subchapter 77-600, subdivision and land development, while encouraging quality development consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
B.  General. The procedures of this section, and the standards and requirements set forth in subchapter 77-600, subdivision and land development, shall apply to all subdivisions or resubdivisions that result in the portioning, dividing, combining, or altering of any lot, parcel, or tract of land, including subdivisions or resubdivisions created by an exercise of the power of eminent domain by an agency of the state or city. 
C.  Previously filed applications. 
1.  Where an application was filed for review prior to January 1, 2017, the city regulations in effect prior to that date shall apply but the developer may elect to develop the property under these regulations. This election shall be made in writing at the time of application and shall be binding for the life of the project. The developer shall not be allowed to select provisions from both the regulations and the developer shall not be granted any waiver to this elective requirement. 
D.  Preliminary platting procedures. 
1.  Pre-application meeting. A pre-application meeting shall be held between the applicant and city staff prior to submission of a preliminary plat application for the purpose of advising the applicant as to the general restrictions, requirements, and other planning and engineering matters applicable to the plat. If an issue arises during the pre- application meeting that directly concerns a city department not represented, the appropriate city staff will be contacted. 
2.  Generally. 
a.  Prior to the filing of a preliminary plat, the developer shall meet with the city staff for a pre-application meeting. 
b.  After the pre- application meeting, the developer shall file the required number of copies of the preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision with the city for submission to the planning and zoning commission, and include the required filing fees and tax certificates showing all taxes have been paid on the property being platted. 
c.  The following notice shall be stamped on the face of each preliminary plat: "Preliminary Plat - for inspection purposes only and in no way official or approved for record purposes." 
d.  Preliminary plats shall be distributed by city staff to city departments. The owner shall be provided an opportunity to attend a developer/city staff meeting for the purpose of notifying the developer of necessary corrections. 
e.  The development services department shall accumulate the comments of the city departments, and conduct a developer/city staff meeting to report the comments and requested corrections to the developer. The developer shall be allowed to make comment or make required corrections and submit the corrected preliminary plat to the development services department for submission to the planning and zoning commission. The corrected preliminary plat shall be submitted within 30 days of the date the original preliminary plat was officially filed and prior to the meeting of the planning and zoning commission at which such preliminary plat is scheduled for consideration. Upon timely receipt, the director of development services shall submit the corrected preliminary plat to the planning and zoning commission. 
f.  A written report shall be prepared by city staff and submitted to the planning and zoning commission stating the review comments of the preliminary plat noting any unresolved issues. 
g.  Following review of the preliminary plat and other materials submitted in conformity with this chapter, the planning and zoning commission shall act on a preliminary plat, within 30 days after the date the preliminary plat is officially filed. The planning and zoning commission may either: 
(1)  Approve the preliminary plat as presented; 
(2)  Approve the preliminary plat with conditions; or 
(3)  Disapprove the preliminary plat. If disapproved, the planning and zoning commission upon written request, shall state the reasons for disapproval. A conditional approval shall be considered a disapproval until the conditions have been satisfied. 
h.  The actions of the planning and zoning commission shall be noted on the face of the preliminary plat. One copy shall be returned to the developer and the other retained in the files of the development services department. 
i.  The planning and zoning commission shall, in its action on the preliminary plat, consider the physical arrangement of the subdivision and determine the adequacy of the street and thoroughfare rights-of-way and alignment and the compliance of the streets and thoroughfares with the major thoroughfare plan, the existing street pattern in the area and with any other applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance and comprehensive plan. The planning and zoning commission, based on city staff recommendations, shall also ascertain that adequate easements for proposed or future utility service and surface drainage are provided, and that the lot sizes and area comply with the zoning ordinance and are adequate to comply with the minimum requirements for the type of sanitary sewage disposal proposed. All on-site sewage disposal systems shall meet the minimum standards required by the City Code of Ordinances and the regulations of Dallas or Rockwall Counties and of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or their successors. 
j.  Approval of a preliminary plat by the planning and zoning commission is not approval of the final plat but is an expression of approval of the layout shown subject to satisfaction of specified conditions. The preliminary plat serves as a guide in the preparation of a final plat. 
3.  Standards for approval. No preliminary plat shall be approved unless the following standards have been met: 
a.  The preliminary plat conforms to the applicable zoning and all other requirements of this chapter and the City Code of Ordinances; and 
b.  A tree survey / preservation plan has been approved in accordance with the regulations in the City Code of Ordinances. 
4.  Data requirement. All preliminary plat applications shall include the following at the time of submittal: 
a.  An approved drainage plan and study, including the 100-year floodplain, and any existing or proposed drainage easements affecting the plan; 
b.  Preliminary water extension and layout plan; 
c.  Preliminary sanitary sewer extension and layout plan; 
d.  The number of copies, page sizes and specific data requirements shall be in accordance with application guidelines provided by the development services department. 
5.  Effect of approval. Approval of a preliminary plat by the planning and zoning commission constitutes authorization for the property owner to submit engineering plans for review by the city engineer. 
6.  Changes or alterations to approved preliminary plat. No previously approved preliminary plat may be changed or altered, except to bring the plat in conformance with the conditions and requirements stipulated by the planning and zoning commission and city council. Minor changes as outlined below shall be permitted at the discretion of the director of development services: 
a.  The proposed internal street and/or circulation system and alignments may be altered if minor in nature. Changes to street classifications, connections to perimeter streets, or extensions to the subdivision's perimeter to un-subdivided property shall not be considered minor alterations. 
b.  A net increase, not to exceed three percent of the total residential lots (rounded to the nearest whole number) in the overall lot yield of the approved preliminary plat may be made, except as elsewhere prohibited by these regulations. 
c.  If the director of development services determines that the proposed changes are minor, a revised preliminary plat may be approved administratively. A revised preliminary plat shall include all property within the boundary of the original preliminary plat. A revision to a preliminary plat shall not affect the expiration date of the plat and shall carry the same expiration as outlined below. 
7.  Expiration of preliminary plat approval. 
a.  The approval of a preliminary plat expires 24 months after the date of planning and zoning commission approval unless a final plat is submitted and has received approval by the planning and zoning commission for the property within such period, or the period is extended by the planning and zoning commission in accordance with the extension and reinstatement guidelines contained herein. 
b.  If the time period is not extended, or a final plat is not submitted and approved by the planning and zoning commission within the 24-month-period, the preliminary plat approval shall be null and void and the owner shall be required to submit a new plat for the property subject to the then existing zoning, subdivision and other regulations. 
8.  Extension and reinstatement of expired preliminary plat. 
a.  Sixty days prior to or following the lapse of approval for a preliminary plat as provided in these regulations, the owner may request the planning and zoning commission to extend or reinstate the approval. 
b.  In determining whether to grant such request, the planning and zoning commission shall take into account the reasons for lapse, the ability of the owner to comply with any conditions attached to the original approval and the extent to which newly adopted zoning and subdivision regulations shall apply to the preliminary plat. The planning and zoning commission may extend or reinstate the preliminary plat or deny the request, in which instance the owner must submit a new preliminary plat application for approval. 
c.  The planning and zoning commission may extend or reinstate the approval subject to additional conditions based upon newly enacted regulations such as are necessary to issue compliance with the original conditions of approval. The planning and zoning commission may also specify a shorter time for lapse of the extended or reinstated preliminary plat than is applicable to original preliminary plat approval. 
9.  Waiver of requirement for preliminary plat. 
a.  A preliminary plat is not required when a minor plat or conveyance plat is submitted in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. 
b.  The director of development services may waive the requirement for a preliminary plat when: 
(1)  The proposed subdivision will occur in only one logical manner because of the nature of the property; and/or 
(2)  The subdivision does not propose a phased development. 
E.  Final platting procedures. 
1.  Generally. 
a.  After approval of the preliminary plat by the planning and zoning commission and upon substantial completion of the required public improvements and issuance of a substantial completion letter from the city engineer to the developer or the provision of an improvement agreement as allowed herein, the owner shall submit a final plat for the property for approval. 
b.  The final plat shall conform substantially to the approved preliminary plat and, if desired by the developer, may cover only a phase of the approved preliminary plat; provided, however, such phase conforms to all the requirements of this Code and the approved preliminary plat indicated the phasing of such development. 
c.  The final plat shall be distributed to the city departments and other agencies for review and comment in the same manner as a preliminary plat. 
d.  The development services department shall accumulate the comments of the city departments and agencies and conduct a developer/city staff conference to report the comments and requested corrections to the developer. The developer shall make comments or make the required corrections and submit the corrected final plat to the development services department for submission to the planning and zoning commission. The corrected final plat shall be submitted within 30 days of the date the original final plat was officially filed and prior to the meeting of the planning and zoning commission at which the original final plat is scheduled for consideration. 
e.  The final plat shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission at the next available meeting with any appropriate comments and recommendations by the development services department. The planning and zoning commission shall act on the final plat within 30 days after the official filing date. If no action is taken by the planning and zoning commission within such period, the final plat shall be deemed approved. A certificate showing the filing date and failure to take action thereon within the 30-day period shall on request be issued by the planning and zoning commission, which shall be sufficient in lieu of a written endorsement of approval. The planning and zoning commission shall be the final approval authority for final plats. The denial of approval of a final plat shall not be appealable to the city council. 
f.  The planning and zoning commission shall consider the final plat, including all proposals by the owner with respect to the dedication of right-of-way for public use, the construction of utilities, streets, drainage and other improvements. 
g.  The approval of the final plat by the planning and zoning commission shall authorize the planning and zoning commission chairperson to execute the certificate of approval on the final plat. 
h.  The approved final plat shall then be filed of record in the plat records of the appropriate county clerk. 
i.  Final plats disapproved by the planning and zoning commission shall be returned to the developer by the development services department. 
j.  In the event a final plat is approved by the planning and zoning commission for a subdivision in phases, the final plat of each phase shall carry the same name throughout the entire subdivision, but bear a distinguishing letter, number or subtitle. Lot and block numbers shall run consecutively throughout the entire subdivision, even though such subdivision may be finally approved in phases. 
2.  Standards for approval. No final plat shall be approved unless the following standards have been met: 
a.  The final plat substantially conforms to the preliminary plat; 
b.  The city engineer has issued a substantial completion letter indicating required public improvements have been substantially constructed, and/or an improvement agreement has been approved by the city for the subsequent completion of the public improvements; 
c.  The final plat conforms to the applicable zoning and all other requirements of this chapter; 
d.  Provisions have been made for adequate public facilities under the terms of this chapter; and 
e.  All required fees have been paid.

4.  Execution and recordation. 
a.  When an improvement agreement and security are required, the chairperson of the planning and zoning commission shall endorse approval on the final plat after the improvement agreement and security have been approved by the city attorney and all the conditions pertaining to the final plat have been satisfied. A final plat for which an improvement agreement has been approved shall contain the following notation on the final plat: 
"This subdivision is subject to an improvement agreement pursuant to the City of Rowlett, Texas Subdivision Ordinance. All or some of the public infrastructure were not constructed and accepted by the City of Rowlett, Texas prior to approval of this final plat." 
b.  When substantial completion of the public improvements is required prior to recordation of the final plat, the chairperson of the planning and zoning commission shall endorse approval on the final plat after all conditions of approval have been satisfied and all public improvements are substantially completed as provided for a written substantial completion letter by the city engineer.

c.  The property owner shall be responsible for filing the final plat with the appropriate county clerk. Simultaneously with the filing of the final plat, the property owner shall record such other agreements of dedication and legal documents as shall be required to be recorded by the planning and zoning commission and the city attorney. The final plat, bearing all required signatures, shall be recorded after final approval and within five working days of its receipt. One copy of the recorded final plat, with street addresses assigned, will be forwarded to the owner by the city staff. 
d.  Approval of a final plat shall certify compliance with the regulations of the City of Rowlett pertaining to the subdivision. An approved and signed final plat may be filed with the appropriate county clerk as a record of the Subdivision and may be used to reference lots and interests in property thereon defined for the purpose of conveyance and development as allowed by these regulations. 
5.  Expiration of final plat approval. 
a.  If public improvements for a subdivision have not been constructed and accepted by the city and the corresponding final plat for said subdivision has not been filed in the appropriate county plat records within two years after the date of final plat approval by the planning and zoning commission, said final plat shall be null and void and shall conclusively be deemed to be withdrawn without further action by the city. This provision shall not apply to final plats approved by the city prior to the effective date of this section. 
b.  Final plats approved prior to the effective date of this section shall become null and void and shall be conclusively deemed to be withdrawn without further action by the city on January 1, 2019, if the public improvements for the subdivision have not been constructed and accepted by the city and the corresponding final plat for said subdivision filed in the appropriate county plat records. 
c.  An approved, unexpired final plat may be extended once by the planning and zoning commission upon written request, for a period not to exceed 12 months provided: 
(1)  Good cause is shown by the developer; and 
(2)  There has been no significant change in development conditions affecting the subdivision; and 
(3)  The final plat continues to comply with all applicable, regulations, standards and this chapter. 
F.  Vacating plats, replats and amending plats. 
1.  Vacating plats. 
a.  The owners of the tract covered by a plat may vacate the plat at any time before any lot in the plat is sold. The plat is vacated when a signed, acknowledged instrument declaring the plat vacated is approved and recorded in the manner prescribed for the original plat. 
b.  If lots have been sold, the plat, or any part of the plat may be vacated on the application of all the owners of lots in the plat with approval obtained in the manner prescribed for the original plat. 
c.  The planning and zoning commission shall disapprove any vacating instrument which abridges or destroys public rights in any of the public uses, improvements, streets or alleys. 
d.  Upon approval and recording with the appropriate county clerk, the vacated plat has no effect. 
2.  Re-platting without vacating preceding plat. 
a.  A re-plat of a subdivision or part of a subdivision may be recorded and is controlled over the preceding plat without vacation of that plat if the replat: 
(1)  Is signed and acknowledged by only the owners of the property being platted; 
(2)  Does not attempt to amend or remove any covenants or restrictions; and 
(3)  Is approved, after a public hearing on the matter, by the planning and zoning commission. 
b.  An application for a replat shall follow the same procedure required for preliminary and final plats. 
3.  Additional requirements for certain replats. 
a.  In addition to compliance with final platting procedures in this Code, a replat without vacation of the preceding plat must conform to the requirements of this section if: 
(1)  During the preceding five years any of the area to be replatted was limited by an interim or permanent zoning classification to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot; or 
(2)  Any lot in the preceding plat was limited by deed restrictions to residential use for not more than two residential units per lot. 
b.  Notice of the public hearing as required by this Code shall be given before the 15th day before the date of the public hearing by: 
(1)  Publication in the official newspaper; and 
(2)  By written notice, with a copy of Texas Local Government Code Section 212.015(c) attached, forwarded to the owners of lots that are in the original subdivision and that are within 200 feet of the lots to be replatted as indicated on the most recently approved city tax rolls of the property upon which the replat is requested. 
c.  If the proposed re-plat requires a waiver and is protested in accordance with this subsection, the proposed re-plat must receive, in order to be approved, the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the members present at the meeting of the planning and zoning commission. For a legal protest, written instruments signed by owners of at least 20 percent of the area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed re-plat and extending 200 feet from that area, but within the original subdivision, must be filed with the planning and zoning commission prior to the close of the public hearing. 
d.  In computing the percentage of land area, the area of streets and alleys shall be included. 
e.  Compliance with section 77-806.F.3.c and 77-806.F.3.d is not required for approval of a replat of part of a preceding plat if the area to be re-platted was designated or reserved for other than single or duplex family residential use by notation on the last legally recorded plat or in the legally recorded restrictions applicable to the plat. 
4.  Administrative approval of certain amending plats, minor plats and re-plats. 
a.  The director of development services is authorized to approve the following: 
(1)  Amending plats described by Section 212.016 Texas Local Government Code;

c.  Any amending plat, minor plat or re-plat meeting the requirements of this section which the director of development services fails or refuses to approve shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for approval. 
G.  Conveyance plats. 
1.  General. A conveyance plat is a boundary survey drawn as a plat. Easements, dedications and reservations may be recorded on a conveyance plat. Engineering plans are not required to process a conveyance plat, unless the developer plans to construct limited improvements on the property. Development fees are not collected at the time of conveyance plat approval. 
2.  Purpose. The purpose of a conveyance plat is to subdivide land and to provide for recordation of same, for the purpose of conveying (i.e., selling) the property without developing it. A conveyance plat may be used to convey the property or interests therein; however, a conveyance plat does not constitute approval for any type of development on the property. A conveyance plat is an interim step in the subdivision and development of land. 
3.  Applicability. A conveyance plat may be used in lieu of a final plat to record the subdivision of property in the following instances: 
a.  To record the remainder of a parent tract that is larger than five acres, and that is created by the record platting of a portion of the parent tract, provided that the remainder is not intended for immediate development; or 
b.  To record the subdivision of a property into parcels, five acres or smaller in area, that are not intended for immediate development, provided that each parcel has direct access to all required public improvements (water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer) via dedicated easements or direct adjacency to existing infrastructure, each parcel has frontage on an existing public right-of-way, and each parcel has frontage on an existing public right-of-way, and the proposed lot meets the minimum lot dimension requirements as stipulated in this Code. 
4.  Certification. The conveyance plat shall contain a certification note on the plat face, as follows: 
"This conveyance plat shall not convey any rights to development or guarantee of public utilities, public or private access, or issuance of addressing and permits, without compliance with all subdivision rules and regulations and the approval and recording of a final plat. A conveyance plat is filed for record in the appropriate county clerk office upon administrative approval by the director of development services." 
H.  Completion and maintenance of public improvements. 
1.  Construction plan procedure. 
a.  General application requirement. Construction plans shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a professional engineer or architect registered in the State of Texas as required by state law governing such professions. Plans submitted for review by the city shall be dated and bear the responsible engineer's or architect's name, serial number and the designation of "engineer," "professional engineer" or "P.E." or "architect" and an appropriate stamp or statement near the engineer's or architect's identification, stating that the documents are for preliminary review and are not intended for construction. Final plans acceptable to the city shall bear the seal and signature of the engineer or architect and the date signed on all sheets of the plans. Public works construction in streets, alleys or easements which will be maintained by the city shall be designed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Texas. 
b.  Construction plan review procedure. Copies of the construction plans, including a copy of the approved preliminary plat and payment for the construction plan review fee shall be submitted to the city engineer for final approval. The plans shall contain all necessary information for construction of the project, including screening walls and other special features. All materials specified shall conform to the standard specifications and standard construction details of the city. Each sheet of the plans shall contain a title block including space for the notation of revisions. This space is to be completed with each revision to the plan sheet and shall clearly note the nature of the revision and the date the revision was made. The city engineer will release the plans for construction, after payment of all inspection fees and a pre-construction conference is held. Upon such release, each contractor shall maintain one set of plans stamped with city release at the project site at all times during construction. 
c.  Failure to commence construction. If commencement of construction has not occurred within one year after approval of the plans, resubmittal of plans may be required by the city engineer for meeting current standards and engineering requirements. For purposes of this section "commencement of construction" shall mean: 
(1)  Issuance of construction permit(s); and 
(2)  Grading of the land. 
2.  Improvement agreements. 
a.  Substantial completion of improvements. Except as provided below, before the final plat is approved by the planning and zoning commission or the director of development services, all applicants shall be required to make substantially complete, in accordance with the city's direction and to the satisfaction of the city engineer, all street, sanitary and other public improvements, including lot improvements on the individual residential lots of the subdivision as required in these regulations and specified in the final plat, and to dedicate those public improvements to the city. As used in this section, "lot improvements" refers to grading and installation of improvements required for proper drainage and prevention of soil erosion. 
b.  Agreement. The city council, considering the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approval of the final plat, and may permit the owner to enter into an improvement agreement by which the owner covenants to complete all required public improvements no later than two years following the date on which the final plat is signed. The city council may also require the owner to complete and dedicate some required public improvements prior to approval of the final plat and to enter into an improvement agreement for completion of the remainder of the required improvements during such two-year period. The improvement agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions as are agreed to by the owner and the city. 
c.  Improvement agreement required for oversize reimbursement. The city shall require an improvement agreement pertaining to any public improvement for which the developer shall request reimbursement from the city for oversize costs. 
d.  Security. The improvement agreement shall require the owner to provide sufficient security covering the completion of the public improvements. The security shall be in the form of cash escrow or, where authorized by the city, a letter of credit or other security acceptable to the city attorney. Security shall be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the city's estimated cost of completion of the required public improvements and lot improvements. In addition to all other security, for completion of those public improvements where the city participates in the cost, the owner shall provide a performance bond from the contractor, with the city as a co-obligee. The issuer of any surety bond and letter of credit shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney. 
e.  Letter of credit. If the planning and zoning commission authorizes the owner to post a letter of credit as security for its promises contained in the improvement agreement, the letter of credit shall: 
(1)  Be irrevocable; 
(2)  Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods but in no event less than two years; and 
(3)  Require only that the city present the issuer with a sight draft and a certificate signed by an authorized representative of the city certifying to the city's right to draw funds under the letter of credit. 
f.  Letter of credit reductions. As portions of the public improvements are completed, the developer may make application to the city engineer to reduce the amount of the original letter of credit. 
(1)  The city engineer, if satisfied that such portion of the improvements has been completed in accordance with city construction standards, may cause the amount of the letter of credit to be reduced by such amount deemed appropriate, so that the remaining amount of the letter of credit adequately insures the completion of the remaining public improvements. 
(2)  Upon the dedication of and acceptance by the city of all required public improvements, the city shall authorize a reduction in the security to ten percent of the original amount of the security if the owner is not in breach of the improvement agreement. The remaining security shall be security for the owner's covenant to maintain the required public improvements and the warrant that the improvements are free from defect for two years thereafter. 
g.  Temporary improvements. The owner shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the planning and zoning commission and shall maintain those temporary improvements for the period specified by the planning and zoning commission. Prior to construction of any temporary improvement, the owner shall file with the city a separate improvement agreement and escrow, or where authorized, a letter of credit, in an appropriate amount for such temporary improvements, which improvement agreement and escrow or letter of credit shall ensure that the temporary improvements will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed. 
h.  Units of government. Governmental units may file, in lieu of the contract and security, a certified resolution or ordinance agreeing to comply with the provisions of this section. 
i.  Failure to complete improvements. For plats for which no improvement agreement has been executed and no security has been posted, if the public improvements are not completed within the period specified by the city, the preliminary plat approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where an improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted and required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of the agreement, the city may: 
(1)  Declare the agreement to be in default and require that all the public improvements be installed regardless of the extent of completion of the development at the time the improvement agreement is declared to be in default; 
(2)  Suspend final plat approval until the public improvements are completed and record a document to that effect for the purpose of public notice; 
(3)  Obtain funds under the security and complete or cause the public improvements to be completed; 
(4)  Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third party, including a subsequent owner of the subdivision for which public improvements were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that subsequent owner's promise to complete the public improvements in the subdivision; and 
(5)  Exercise any other rights available under the law. 
j.  Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of street, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by authorization of the city engineer. The approval by the planning and zoning commission of a plat, whether preliminary or final, shall not in and of itself be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the city of any street, easement, or park shown on plat. The planning and zoning commission may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. 
k.  Maintenance of public improvements. The owner shall maintain all required public improvements for a period of two years following the acceptance by the city and shall provide a warranty that all public improvements shall be free from defect for a period of two years following such acceptance by the city. 
3.  Construction procedures. 
a.  Permit required. A permit is required from the city prior to commencement of any subdivision development work in the city which affects erosion control, vegetation or tree removal or a floodplain. 
b.  Preconstruction conference. The city engineer may require that all contractors participating in the construction meet for a preconstruction conference to discuss the project prior to release of a permit. 
c.  Conditions prior to authorization. Prior to authorizing release of a construction permit, the city engineer shall be satisfied that the following conditions have been met: 
(1)  The preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning and zoning commission; 
(2)  All required contract documents shall be completed and filed with the city engineer; 
(3)  All necessary off-site easements or dedications required for city infrastructure and not shown on the final plat must be conveyed solely to the city, with proper signatures affixed. The original of the documents shall be returned to the engineering department prior to approval and release of the engineering plans and issuance of a permit; 
(4)  All contractors participating in the construction shall be provided, at the developer's cost, with a set of approved plans bearing the stamp of release of the engineering department. One set of these plans shall remain on the job site at all times; 
(5)  A complete list of the contractors, their representatives on the site, and telephone numbers where a responsible party may be reached at all times must be submitted to the city engineer at least 24 hours prior to the preconstruction meeting; and 
(6)  All applicable fees must be paid to the city. 
4.  Inspection of public improvements. 
a.  General procedure. Construction inspection shall be supervised by the city engineer. Construction shall be in accordance with the approved plans, the standard specifications, and the standard construction details of the city. Any change in design required during construction should be made by the engineer whose seal and signature are shown on the plans. Another engineer may make revisions to the original engineering plans if so authorized by the owner of the plans and if those revisions are noted on the plans or documents, provided such revisions are permitted by the Texas Engineering Practice Act. All revisions shall be approved by the city engineer. If the city engineer's inspection finds that any of the required public improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the city's standard construction details and standard specifications, the owner shall be responsible for completing and/or correcting the public improvements. 
b.  Certificate of satisfactory completion. The city will not accept dedication of required public improvements until the applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the city engineer, through submission of record drawings, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the planning and zoning commission or city engineer that all required public improvements have been completed. The record drawings shall also include a complete set of drawings of the paving, drainage, water, sanitary sewer or other public improvements, showing that the layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for the plat, and all changes made in the plans during construction and containing on each sheet a record drawing stamp bearing the signature of the engineer and the date. The engineer or surveyor shall also furnish a paper copy of the final plat and engineering plans along with digital copies of the plans in portable document format ("PDF") and computer assisted design drawings ("CADD"), in such a format that is compatible with the city's CADD system. The developer shall provide a maintenance bond executed by a corporate surety duly authorized to do business in the State of Texas, payable to the city and approved by the city as to form, to guarantee the maintenance of the construction for a period of two years after its completion and acceptance by the city. In lieu of a maintenance bond the developer may submit either an irrevocable letter of credit payable to the city and approved by the city as to form, or a cash bond payable to the city and approved as to form. The amount of the maintenance bond, letter of credit or cash bond shall be at least ten percent of the full cost of the infrastructure in the subdivision, as determined by the construction costs. When such requirements have been met the city engineer shall thereafter accept the public improvements. 
c.  Acceptance of the development shall mean that the developer has transferred all rights to all the public improvements to the city for use and maintenance. 
d.  Upon acceptance of the required public improvements, the city engineer shall submit a certificate to the developer stating that all required public improvements have been satisfactorily completed. 
5.  Deferral of required improvements. 
a.  The planning and zoning commission may upon petition of the owner defer at the time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all public improvements are not required in the interests of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
b.  Whenever a petition to defer the construction of any public improvement required under these regulations is granted by the planning and zoning commission, the owner shall deposit in escrow the developer's share of the costs of the future public improvements with the city prior to approval of the final plat, or the owner may execute a separate improvement agreement secured by a cash escrow or, where authorized, a letter of credit guaranteeing completion of the deferred public improvements upon demand of the city. 
6.  Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy. No building permit shall be issued for a lot or building site unless the lot or site has been officially recorded by a final plat approved by the City of Rowlett, and all public improvements as required for final plat approval have been completed, except as permitted below: 
a.  Building permits may be issued for nonresidential and multi-family (apartments) development provided that a preliminary plat is approved by the city and civil construction plans have been released by the city engineer. Building construction will not be allowed to surpass the construction of fire protection improvements. 
b.  The city engineer may authorize residential building permits for a portion of a subdivision, provided that a preliminary plat has been approved and all public improvements have been completed for that portion of the development, including but not limited to those required for fire and emergency protection. Notwithstanding, no lot may be sold or title conveyed until a final plat approved by the city has been recorded. 
c.  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building or the use of property unless all subdivision improvements have been completed and a final plat approved by the city has been recorded. Notwithstanding the above, the city building official may authorize the occupancy of a structure provided that an agreement providing cash escrow, a letter of credit, or other sufficient surety is approved by the city for the completion of all remaining public improvements. 
7.  Utility connections. Utility connections for individual lots are not authorized until a final plat has been approved in accordance with this chapter. 
8.  Withholding improvements. 
a.  The city hereby defines its policy to be that the city will withhold all city improvements of whatsoever nature, including the maintenance of streets and the furnishing of sewage facilities and water service from all additions which have not been constructed and approved in accordance with this chapter. 
b.  The City of Rowlett may withhold the issuing of a street number or building permit for the erection of any building in the City of Rowlett on a newly subdivided parcel of land until all the requirements of these subdivision regulations have been complied with, including installation of and acceptance by the city of all water works, sewage and paving improvements for the area designated. 
9.  As-built plans. 
a.  The developer or his engineer shall present the city with one digital copy and three black line complete "as built" sets of plans for all paving, drainage structures, water mains and sewer mains before final acceptance of the new developments.

I.  Subdivision variance. 
1.  General. Where the commission finds that unreasonable hardships or difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these subdivision regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that the variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided the commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
a.  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property; 
b.  The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property; and 
c.  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out.

The city council shall vote by simple majority vote of those members present at the meeting to either approve or deny the appeal, which decision shall be final and binding. In cases where development or site plan approval includes provisions that must be approved by the city council, planning and zoning approval of the development or site plan shall be deemed a recommendation to the city council, which recommendation shall be referred to the city council for action. The city council's decision shall be final and binding. 
D.  Approval criteria. A development plan shall be approved upon a finding that the development plan meets all of the following criteria: 
1.  The development plan is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan; 
2.  The development plan is consistent with any previously approved subdivision plat, planned development, or any other precedent plan or land use approval as applicable; 
3.  The development plan complies with all applicable development and design standards set forth in this Code, including but not limited to the provisions in Chapter 77-200 Zoning districts, Chapter 77-300, Use regulations, Chapter 77-400, Dimensional requirements, and Chapter 77-500, Development and design standards; 
4.  Any significant adverse impacts reasonably anticipated to result from the use will be mitigated or offset to the maximum extent practicable; and 
E.  Effect of development plan approval. 
1.  If development of a lot or tract with an approved development plan has not commenced within two years of the date of final approval of all components of the development plan, the development plan shall be expired, and a new application, with fee, shall be required for review and approval of a plan for development of the property. Such new approval shall be required before a building permit may be issued for development. For the purpose of this subsection, the term "commenced" shall be interpreted to mean that a building permit has been obtained and is valid; that utilities have received final inspection by the city as required; but shall not be interpreted to include site grading. 
2.  If development of a lot or tract with an approved development plan has commenced within the above allotted time period, but a building permit has expired prior to completion of the project, and such remains incomplete and without substantial progress for a six-month period, the development plan shall be deemed to have expired, and a new application, with fee, shall be required for review and approval of a plan for development of the property. Such new approval shall be required before a building permit may be issued for development. 
3.  Such review and approval shall be evaluated according to the standards of this section, taking into account all changes to applicable ordinances that may have occurred subsequent to the prior approval. Final architectural and engineering design requirements may necessitate minor changes in the approved development plan, which may be approved by the director of planning.

Sec. 77-810. - Temporary use permits. 
A.  Purpose. This section sets the procedure for the permitting and establishment of temporary uses authorized by section 77-304. 
B.  Applicability. No use that is classified as a temporary use shall be placed or established on property without first receiving a temporary use permit. 
1.  Permit required. All temporary uses and structures shall obtain a temporary use permit. A new temporary use permit is required for each new location within the city, regardless of whether or not the temporary use is located on the same property as a previous temporary use permit or on a new site. 
C.  Procedure. 
1.  Application. An application for a temporary use permit shall be filed with the director of planning in a form specified by the director. An application for a temporary use permit may be filed only by the owner of the property, or by a representative specifically authorized by the owner to file such application. 
(a)  Contents. All applications shall include at least the following information: 
(1)  A statement of the specific temporary use applied for including the specific time period for which the applicant is requesting temporary use. 
(2)  A specific site plan drawn to scale showing the specific dimensions and arrangement of the proposed temporary use. 
(3)  Provisions for parking, water service and sanitary facilities. 
(b)  Filing deadline. All applications for temporary use permits shall be filed at least two weeks prior to the date the temporary use will commence, or at least four weeks prior to the date the temporary use will commence if public safety support is requested from the city. The director of planning may waive this filing deadline requirement in an individual case, for good cause shown, and following concurrence by affected city departments. 
2.  Issuance of permit; approval criteria. 
(a)  The director of planning shall issue a temporary use permit only upon finding that the proposed temporary use satisfies the requirements set forth in section 77-304. 
(b)  For those temporary uses not specifically listed in section 77-304 or uses requesting a duration not allowed in section 77-304, application shall be made to the planning and zoning commission. The commission shall consider such factors as nature of the use; time period allowed for the use; parking; cleanup requirements; and signage. The commission may grant or deny the application and, if granted, the commission may impose such conditions, regulations or restrictions as deemed necessary. 
3.  Duration of permit. A temporary use permit shall be valid only for the time period stated on the permit, unless otherwise authorized by this Code. 
4.  Time between permits. No new temporary use permit for the same temporary use on the same property may be granted for a period of six months from the date of termination of such renewal or additional period, unless otherwise authorized by this Code. 
5.  Extensions and renewals. A temporary use permit may only be renewed or extended once for certain permit types by action of the planning and zoning commission as provided in section 77-304. 
6.  Appeals. The decision of the planning zoning commission to approve, approve with conditions, or deny a temporary use permit may be appealed to the city council. An appeal shall be filed in writing with the director of planning within 20 days of the planning and zoning commission's decision.

(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 020-11, § 3, 8-16-2011) 
Sec. 77-811. - Minor modification. 
A.  Purpose and scope. This section sets out the required review and approval procedures for "minor modifications," which are minor changes from otherwise applicable standards that may be approved by the city council or the planning and zoning commission. Minor modifications are to be used when the small size of the modification requested, and the unlikelihood of any adverse effects on nearby properties or the neighborhood, makes it unnecessary to complete a formal variance process. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  Minor modifications to general development and zoning district standards. As part of the review and approval of any procedure set forth in this chapter, the city council or the planning and zoning commission may approve minor modifications of up to a maximum of 20 percent from the following general development and zoning district standards provided that the approval criteria of subsection 4. are met, except where authority is specifically conferred to another decision making body under this Code: 
(a)  General development standards set forth in chapter 77-500, Development and design standards; and 
(b)  Subdivision design and improvement standards set forth in chapter 77-600, Subdivision and land development. 
2.  Limitations on authority to grant minor modifications. In no circumstance shall any decision-making body approve a minor modification that results in: 
(a)  An increase in overall project density; 
(b)  A change in permitted uses or mix of uses; 
(c)  An increase in building height above what is allowed in the zoning district; 
(d)  A waiver, minor modification, or deviation from the use-specific standards, set forth in subchapter 77-303, unless so authorized by the planning and zoning commission where such is an authorized action; or 
(e)  A change in conditions attached to the approval of any subdivision plan, site plan, or conditional use permit, unless the change is to a conceptual plan and approval was based upon the recognition of such, and where the change will have minimal design or layout alterations. 
3.  Procedure. 
(a)  Minor modifications approved by city council or planning and zoning commission. The city council or planning and zoning commission may initiate or approve a minor modification allowed under this section at any time before it takes action, or as part of taking action, on a development application under its respective jurisdiction. 
(b)  Noted on pending application. Staff shall specify any approved minor modifications and the justifications for such modifications on the pending development application for which the modifications were sought. 
4.  Approval criteria. The decision-making body may approve the minor modification only if it finds that the modification meets all of the criteria below: 
(a)  The requested modification is consistent with the comprehensive plan or the stated purpose of this Code; 
(b)  The requested modification meets all other applicable building and safety codes; 
(c)  The requested modification does not encroach into a recorded easement or cross a building line; 
(d)  The requested modification will have no significant adverse impact on the health, safety, or general welfare of surrounding property owners or the general public, or such impacts will be substantially mitigated; and 
(e)  The requested modification is necessary to either: 
(1)  Compensate for some practical difficulty or some unusual aspect of the site of the proposed development not shared by landowners in general; or 
(2)  Accommodate an alternative or innovative design practice that achieves to the same or better degree the objective of the existing design standard to be modified. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 012-08, § 19, 4-1-2008; Ord. No. 016-09, §§ 40, 41, 6-2-2009) 
Sec. 77-812. - Variances. 
A.  Purpose and scope. The variance process is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this Code in those cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create an unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this Code. It is not intended that variances be granted merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this Code may impose on property owners in general. Rather, it is intended to provide relief where the requirements of this Code render the land difficult or impossible to use because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variance is requested. A variance is intended to be permanent in nature and to run with the land or the use associated with the variance. State and/or federal laws or requirements may not be varied by the city. 
B.  Variance defined. A variance is an exemption from the literal terms of a zoning ordinance that avoids an unnecessary hardship caused by special conditions associated with the property. The unnecessary hardship must be unique to the property, arising from topographical, geographical, physical or dimensional features of the property, and not to the owner or occupant. A variance is appropriate in unique circumstances to allow limited exemptions from setbacks, lot width, lot depth, lot coverage, floor area ratio, sidewalks, home size, lot size, signs and similar regulations and shall not be granted if based on market conditions, economic factors, or profitability, marketability or feasibility of development on the property. A variance shall not be granted if contrary to the public interest, and if granted, the spirit of the regulations must be observed and substantial justice done. 
C.  Prohibited variances. 
1.  Under no circumstances shall be board of adjustment grant a variance to allow a use not permitted, or a use expressly or by implication prohibited under the terms of this Code, for the zoning district containing the property for which the variance is sought. 
2.  Variances from adopted uniform codes are prohibited except as provided therein or herein. 
3.  Under no circumstances shall the board of adjustment grant a variance from any written conditions attached by another decision-making body to the approval of a planned development district, conditional use permit, subdivision plat, or development plan. 
4.  No variance shall be granted if the conditions or circumstances affecting the applicant's property are of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or situations. 
D.  Procedure. 
1.  Rules of procedure for board of adjustment. The board of adjustment shall adopt rules and procedures regarding the function and conduct of business consistent with V.T.C.A. Local Government Code Ch. 211. 
2.  Application. An application for a variance shall be submitted to the city on a form contained in the user's guide. A request for variance may be initiated only by the property owner or his authorized representative. The application must state what relief is being sought and must specify the facts or circumstances that are alleged to show that the application meets the applicable criteria. Once the application is complete, the application shall be scheduled for consideration at a meeting open to the public, and shall transmit to the board of adjustment all applications and other records pertaining to the variance prior to the hearing. 
3.  Action by the board of adjustment. Upon receiving the application materials from the city, the board of adjustment shall hold a hearing on the proposed variance in accordance with adopted rules and procedures. Posted notice of the hearing shall be provided pursuant to subchapter 77-803F. 
4.  Variance shall be least divergent. If a variance is authorized, the variance shall represent the least deviation from the regulations that will afford relief. 
E.  Lapse of approval. Any variance granted shall become null and void: 
1.  If the variance is not exercised within 180 days of the date it is granted, or 
2.  If any building, structure, or characteristic of use permitted by variance is moved or altered so as to enlarge the variance or discontinue it. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 016-09, § 42, 6-2-2009) 
Sec. 77-813. - Appeals of administrative decisions. 
A.  Purpose and scope. Appeals to the board of adjustment from the decisions of the city's administrative staff are allowed under this Code. It is the intention of this section that all questions arising in connection with the interpretation and enforcement of this Code shall be presented first to the appropriate administrative officer of the city, that such questions shall be presented to the board of adjustment only on appeal from the decisions of that department, and that recourse from the decision of the board of adjustment shall be to the courts. It is further the intention of this section that the duties of the city council in connection with this Code shall not include the hearing or passing upon disputed questions that may arise in connection with the enforcement thereof. The city council may request that the board issue an interpretation or rule on an interpretation where such has not been previously determined by the board. 
B.  Rules of procedure for board of adjustment. The board of adjustment shall adopt rules and procedures regarding the function and conduct of business consistent with V.T.C.A. Local Government Code Ch. 211. 
C.  Decisions that may be appealed. An asserted error in any order, requirement, permit, decision, determination, refusal, or interpretation made by any administrative officer, city board or commission in interpreting and/or enforcing the provisions of this Code may be appealed to the board of adjustment, unless otherwise provided in this Code. 
D.  Filing of appeal; effect of filing. 
1.  An appeal to the board of adjustment may be brought by any person, firm, corporation, office, department, board, bureau, or commission aggrieved by the order, requirement, permit, decision, or determination that is the subject of the appeal. 
2.  An application for an appeal shall be filed with the city. Once the application is complete, the appeal shall be scheduled for consideration at a meeting open to the public before the board of adjustment. The administrative officer from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the board of adjustment all applications and other records or reasons for determinations pertaining to such appeal. The application shall be filed no later than 20 days after the date of the contested action. 
3.  The filing of an appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the contested action, unless the administrative officer certifies to the board of adjustment that, in his or her opinion by reason of facts stated in the certification, such a stay would cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of law on notice to the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken, with due cause shown. 
E.  Action by the board of adjustment. Upon receiving the application materials, the board of adjustment shall hold a hearing on the appeal and conduct a hearing in accordance with rules and procedures adopted by the board. 
F.  Appeal from board of adjustment. Appeals from the board of adjustment are to the courts, as per Section 211.011 of the Texas Local Government Code, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 016-09, § 43, 6-2-2009) 
CHAPTER 77-900. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 77-901. - General provisions. 
A.  Purpose and scope. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of legal uses, structures, lots, signs, and use characteristics such as parking and landscaping, established prior to the effective date of this Code or prior codes, or the effective date of future amendments to this Code, that no longer conform to the requirements of this Code. All such situations are collectively referred to in this chapter as "nonconformities." While nonconformities may continue, the provisions of this chapter are intended to curtail investment in nonconformities to bring about their eventual elimination in order to preserve the integrity of this Code and the goals of the City of Rowlett. 
B.  Definition. A nonconformity shall include any lawful use of property or any lawful structure, sign, or platted lot, or any landscaping, parking, or building design element: 
1.  That exists or existed on the date of the adoption of an ordinance that rendered it nonconforming with the provisions of the new ordinance or this Code; or 
2.  That currently conforms to the regulations in this Code, but in the future will not conform to a future rezoning, or amendment to the text of this Code; or 
3.  That currently conforms to the regulations in this Code, but because of future governmental action, such as the acquisition of property for a public purpose, will not conform to the provisions of the Code in effect at the time. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-902. - Regulations applicable to all nonconformities. 
A.  Authority to continue. Nonconformities may continue to be used and occupied, subject to regulations as to the maintenance of premises and conditions of operations set forth in this chapter, or unless such nonconformity is terminated as provided herein. 
B.  Determination of nonconformity status. In all cases, the burden of proof for establishing the existence of a legal nonconformity shall be solely upon the owner of the nonconformity. 
C.  Minor repairs and maintenance. 
1.  Minor repairs or maintenance of nonconformities that are required to keep structures or sites in a safe condition are permitted, provided that the minor repair or maintenance does not increase the extent of nonconformity. For purposes of this section, "maintenance or minor repair" shall mean: 
(a)  Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or interior appearance of a building or structure without expanding or altering the building or structure; 
(b)  Maintenance of land areas to protect against health and environmental hazards and promote the safety of surrounding land uses; 
(c)  Repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions that cause a threat to public safety; and 
(d)  Repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs otherwise permitted by this Code. 
2.  In addition, any existing occupied single-family residential dwelling that is deemed to be a nonconforming use shall be allowed to make improvements to the main and accessory structures so long as improvements do not increase the degree of nonconformity or increase the height or footprint. 
D.  Change of tenancy or ownership. Changes of ownership, tenancy, or management of property with an existing nonconformity are permitted but such nonconformities shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this Code. 
E.  Damage or destruction. 
1.  If a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent where the replacement cost is greater than 50 percent of its appraised value at the time of damage or destruction as determined by the latest tax rolls, then such nonconformity shall not be re-established and such structure may only be rebuilt in compliance with the requirements of this Code except upon action by the board of adjustment to permit reconstruction of such structure and continuance of the nonconforming use. The board of adjustment shall have due regard for the rights of the person or persons affected, and shall consider such in regard to public welfare, character of the area surrounding, nature of the use in relation to the intent of the area, and the conservation, preservation and protection of property. 
2.  Any existing single-family or two-family residential dwelling that is a nonconforming use that is destroyed to an extent where the replacement cost is less than 50 percent of its appraised value at the time of damage or destruction as determined by the latest tax rolls, due to fire, flood, or acts of nature or God, shall be allowed to rebuild on site, provided that the use is either for single-family or two-family residential use and in conformance with the prevailing zoning district. 
3.  The intentional destruction of a structure by any owner of the use and/or structure and/or property shall immediately terminate all nonconforming rights, and all use of the structure or property shall cease and desist. 
F.  Abandonment of use. If a nonconforming use, structure or property is discontinued for a period exceeding 180 days, such use, structure or property shall be discontinued. Any future use of the property or structure shall conform to the terms of this Code. At a hearing on the matter, the board of adjustment may consider evidence by the owner that there was a clear intent not to abandon the use, structure or property even though the use, structure or property was discontinued for 180 days or more. If no such evidence is presented, the board may presume the intent to abandon the nonconforming use, structure or property. The owner shall have ten days following the decision by the board of adjustment to terminate the nonconforming use, structure or property. If a nonconforming use, structure or property is discontinued for a period of 180 days or more, and the space previously occupied is vacant of merchandise or other items needed to conduct the business, or where all activities have ceased during this period, the board of adjustment may consider such as an abandonment of the nonconforming use, structure or property. 
G.  Disputes. Any dispute regarding nonconforming uses shall be referred to the board of adjustment for further review and action. 
H.  Violation of City Codes or ordinances. The board of adjustment may determine that the right to operate a nonconforming use, structure, or property shall be immediately terminated upon a finding of a violation of any of the provisions of this ordinance or violation of any ordinance of the City of Rowlett with respect to such nonconforming use or property or structure. 
1.  Violation of the nonconforming status regarding the use that will be subject to determination by the board of adjustment for termination of the nonconforming use shall include those actions or instances where, after the effective date of this ordinance, a use has expanded without approval by the city; where a use is operating without a certificate of occupancy issued by the city; where an activity is taking place that is not allowed in the zoning district; or 
2.  Violation of the nonconforming status regarding the property that will be subject to determination by the board of adjustment for termination of the nonconforming use shall include those actions or instances where, after the effective date of this ordinance, landscaping is not installed as required, is removed and not replaced; where landscaping is not maintained in accordance to city standards; where the irrigation system is inoperable, where there are activities occurring on the property that are not allowed within the zoning district; where there are activities occurring on the property that have not received the proper permits; where required parking areas or spaces is being used for other than its intended use to accommodate employees and patrons; where parking lots, drives, access easements, curbs are not maintained to city standards; or

Sec. 77-903. - Additional regulations for nonconforming uses. 
A.  Limitations on continuation of nonconforming uses of land or structures. Nonconforming uses of land or structures are subject to the following additional limitations: 
1.  No nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the regulations that make the use nonconforming. Any nonconforming use on a lot or portion of a lot may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
2.  No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the regulations that make the use nonconforming. 
3.  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located and where such is in conformance with requirements of this Code regarding the use of property, exterior building materials, signs, landscaping, parking and other such issues. 
4.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of the applicable regulations, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such buildings. 
5.  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Code shall be erected in connection with the nonconforming use of land or structure. 
B.  Change of use. 
1.  A nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that (a) the new use creates no greater impacts on surrounding properties and is no more intensive than the use it replaces, and (b) no structural alterations to the building are required to accommodate such change, subject to paragraph 3., below. A nonconforming use that has been changed to a less nonconforming use pursuant to this subsection may not thereafter be changed back to a more nonconforming use. 
2.  A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, may not thereafter be changed back to any nonconforming use. 
3.  [Reserved.] 
C.  Amortization of nonconforming uses. 
1.  Request to establish compliance date. The city council may request that the board of adjustment establish a compliance date for a nonconforming use. In addition, any person who resides or owns real property in the city may request that the board consider establishing a compliance date for a nonconforming use. Upon receiving such a request, the board shall hold a public hearing to determine whether continued operation of the nonconforming use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties or will be detrimental to the development of uses for the economic welfare of the City of Rowlett. If, based on the evidence presented at the public hearing, the board determines that continued operation of the use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties or will be detrimental to the development of uses for the economic welfare of the City of Rowlett, it shall proceed to establish a compliance date for the nonconforming use; otherwise, it shall not. 
2.  Factors to be considered. The board shall consider the following factors when determining whether continued operation of the nonconforming use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties: 
(a)  The character of the surrounding neighborhood. 
(b)  The degree of incompatibility of the use with the zoning district in which it is located. 
(c)  The manner in which the use is being conducted. 
(d)  The hours of operation of the use. 
(e)  The extent to which continued operation of the use may threaten public health or safety. 
(f)  The environmental impacts of the use's operation, including but not limited to the impacts of noise, glare, dust, and odor. 
(g)  The extent to which public disturbances may be created or perpetuated by continued operation of the use. 
(h)  The extent to which traffic or parking problems may be created or perpetuated by continued operation of the use. 
(i)  Any other factors relevant to the issue of whether continued operation of the use will adversely affect nearby properties. 
3.  Finality of decision. A decision by the board to grant a request to establish a compliance date is not a final decision and cannot be immediately appealed. A decision by the board to deny a request to establish a compliance date is final unless appealed to state court within ten days in accordance with Chapter 211 of the Local Government Code. 
4.  Determination of amortization period. 
(a)  If the board determines that continued operation of the nonconforming use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties or will be detrimental to the development of uses for the economic welfare of the City of Rowlett, it shall, in accordance with the law, provide a compliance date for the nonconforming use under a plan whereby the owner's actual investment in the use before the time that the use became nonconforming can be amortized within a definite time period. 
(b)  The following factors must be considered by the board in determining a reasonable amortization period: 
(1)  The owner's capital investment in structures, fixed equipment, and other assets (excluding inventory and other assets that may be feasibly transferred to another site) on the property before the time the use became nonconforming. 
(2)  Any costs that are directly attributable to the establishment of a compliance date, including demolition expenses, relocation expenses, termination of leases, and discharge of mortgages. 
(3)  Any return on investment since inception of the use, including net income and depreciation. 
(4)  The anticipated annual recovery of investment, including net income and depreciation. 
5.  Compliance requirement. If the board establishes a compliance date for a nonconforming use, the use must cease operations on that date and it may not operate thereafter unless it becomes a conforming use within the requirements of this Code. 
6.  Demolition required. If, in establishing a compliance date, demolition costs are included in an amortization schedule, such demolition shall occur by the property owner within 30 days following a decision by the board of adjustment. If within this period the property owner has not demolished the structure, the city may undertake a contract to have the structure demolished and a lien placed on the property to cover all costs. This provision may be waived by the director of planning if there is a letter of intent filed by the user or owner provided to the city within 30 days following a decision of the board of adjustment indicating intent to redevelop the property in conformance with City Codes. The user or owner shall have six months to submit development plans. Following approval of development plans, the owner shall begin construction within six months. If no activity occurs within the 30-day period following the board of adjustment decision, and/or construction has not begun within the six-month period following the issuance of a new building permit for a conforming structure, the city may undertake a contract to have the structure demolished and a lien placed on the property to cover all costs. 
7.  [Definitions.] For purposes of this section, "owner" means the owner of the nonconforming use at the time of the board's determination of a compliance date for the nonconforming use. For the purpose of this section, "property" means the land and/or structure.

Sec. 77-904. - Same-Nonconforming structures. 
    Nonconforming uses of land or structures are subject to the following additional limitations: 
A.  No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion of a structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. This subsection shall not be construed to allow the expansion of a nonconforming use within a conforming or nonconforming structure. 
B.  Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
C.  Any structure in which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the use regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-905. - Same-Nonconforming lots/parcels/tracts. 
A.  In any residential district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Code, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any lot that is of record at the effective date of the original adoption or amendment of applicable regulations. This provision shall apply even if the lot fails to meet the requirements for the area or width, or both, that are applicable in the district. Setback and lot coverage requirements applicable to nonconforming lots of record shall be those of the zone with the largest lot area requirement within which the lot would be conforming. 
B.  Where two or more adjacent nonconforming lots or parcels are held in common ownership, they will be considered a single lot for purposes of development review and approval. Treatment as a single lot for purposes of development review and approval shall not be thereafter affected by any subsequent resale or subdivision of all or a part of any such lots into separate ownership. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-906. - Same-Nonconforming signs. 
A.  Termination. A nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming status, and therefore shall be brought into conformance with this Code or removed, when any of the following occur: 
1.  The size or shape of the sign or supporting structure is changed; 
2.  The sign structure or supporting structure is altered. Alteration does not include ordinary repairs and/or maintenance; 
3.  The nonconforming sign is accessory to a nonconforming use that has lost its nonconforming status; 
4.  Structure(s) on the property on which the sign is located is subject to an application for a building permit for reconstruction, remodeling, expansion, or other improvements, and the value of the proposed improvements total more than 25 percent of the appraised value of the structure as determined by the latest tax rolls; or 
5.  An approved application for a certificate of occupancy for a change of business is issued and a sign is associated with such occupancy. This subsection applies to on-premise advertising signs only. 
6.  Portable signs shall have no lawful nonconforming rights or status. 
B.  Maintenance of nonconforming signs. Nonconforming signs shall continue to be maintained in safe condition pursuant to the building regulations of the city. 
C.  Alteration, relocation or replacement of nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign shall not be structurally altered, relocated, or replaced unless it is brought into compliance with the provisions of this Code. 
D.  Reconstruction of damaged sign. If a sign and/or its support are damaged to the extent where the repair costs exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost of the sign, the sign shall be removed or brought into compliance. 
E.  Definition of a sign. For purposes of this section, a sign is defined as a structure that is intended for the placement of a message, regardless if a message is included on the sign. 
(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006; Ord. No. 012-12, § 2, 5-15-2012) 
Sec. 77-907. - Same-Other nonconformities. 
    If (a) an application is filed for a building permit or the for reconstruction, remodeling, expansion, or other improvements of a multi-family, commercial, industrial, or mixed-use structure, and (b) the value of the proposed improvements totals more than 25 percent of the appraised value of the structure as listed on the latest tax rolls, the applicant shall be required to address the following nonconformities prior to, or as part of the improvements authorized by, such building permit, unless the director of planning determines in writing that such nonconformities have no significant adverse impact on surrounding properties: 
A.  Screening of mechanical equipment; 
B.  Screening walls or fences (for parking, waste, or storage areas) ; 
C.  Driveway surface materials; 
D.  Landscaping;

(Ord. No. 025-06, § 1(Exh. A), 6-6-2006) 
Sec. 77-908. - Illegal nonconformities. 
    An illegal nonconformity exists when: 
A.  A nonconforming structure is destroyed or substantially destroyed by an intentional act of the owner or an agent. If this occurs, the nonconforming structure shall lose its nonconforming status and thereafter shall be required to be in conformity with existing codes. If a nonconforming use was also in the structure, the nonconforming use and all site improvements shall lose their nonconforming status and be required thereafter to come into compliance with existing codes. 
B.  A use, structure, or site improvement occurs without being lawfully authorized in accordance with the provisions of this Code. Such use and/or structure shall therefore cease all operations until such time that the required plans and/or permits are approved.

Written notice of revocation stating that such violation shall be corrected within ten days shall be served upon the property owner, agent, applicant, or other person to whom the permit or approval was issued, or such notice may be posted in a prominent location at the place of violation. No work or construction shall proceed after service of the revocation notice. If after the ten-day period, arrangements acceptable to the director of planning have not been made, the director shall cause a citation to be issued in accordance with subsection A above. 
E.  Stop-work orders. 
1.  Whenever any building or structure or site or part thereof is being demolished, constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in a hazardous manner, in violation of any state or municipal building law, or in a manner that endangers life or property, the director has the authority to issue a stop-work order for the specific part of the work that is in violation or presents the hazard. 
2.  With or without revoking permits, the director may issue an order to stop work on any property on which there is an uncorrected violation of either a provision of this Code or a provision of an entitlement or other form of authorization issued under this Code. 
3.  The stop-work order shall be in writing directed to the person doing the work, and shall specify the provisions of this Code or other law allegedly in violation, and the conditions for resumption of work. After any such order has been served, no work shall proceed on any building, other structure, or tract of land covered by such order, except to correct such violation or comply with the order. 
4.  The stop-work order shall also indicate that failure to comply with the order may subject the violator to civil and/or criminal liability as penalty for the violation(s). 
5.  Once conditions for resumption of the work have been met, the director shall rescind the stop-work order. 
F.  Injunctive relief. The director may seek injunctive relief or other appropriate relief in a court of competent jurisdiction against any person who fails to comply with any provision of this Code or any requirement or condition imposed pursuant to this Code. In any court proceedings in which the city seeks a preliminary injunction, it shall be presumed that a violation of this Code is a real, immediate, and irreparable injury to the public; that the public will be irreparably injured by the continuation of the violation unless the violation is enjoined; and that there is no plain and adequate remedy at law for the subject Code violation. 
G.  Abatement. The city may abate the violations pursuant to this subsection. This remedy is specifically authorized, but not limited to, cases in which a Homeowner's Association fails to construct, improve, or maintain any amenity, landscaping, buffers, fencing, or other improvements required by the terms of any permit or approval. 
1.  Before action is taken to abate a violation, a final warning notice shall be posted on the property and served personally or by certified mail with return receipt required to the owner of record of the property, or to the Homeowner's Association, as applicable. 
2.  Unless this notice is appealed, pursuant to subchapter 77-813, appeals of administrative decisions, within 20 days of the posting of the final warning; the director shall proceed to abate the violation. 
3.  The director shall keep an account of the cost, including incidental expenses, incurred by the city in the abatement of any violation. The director shall forward a bill for collection to the violator or the Homeowner's Association, and to owner of record of the property specifying the nature and costs of the work performed. For purposes of this section, the term "incidental expenses" shall include but not be limited to the actual expenses and costs to the city in the preparation of the notices, specifications and contracts, work inspection, and interest from the date of completion at the rate prescribed by law for delinquent real property taxes. 
4.  The responsibility for payment of the charges for abatement as set forth in this section shall rest solely upon the owners of the property upon which the abatement occurred, or the Homeowner's Association, as applicable. Such charges become a lien upon the real property upon which the violation was located. The lien shall be subordinate to all existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same property and shall be paramount to all other liens except for state or municipal property taxes, with which it shall be upon a parity. The lien shall continue until the charges and all interest due and payable thereon are paid.

A.  Residential use definitions. 
1.  Household living. This use category is characterized by residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a household. Tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month or longer basis (lodging where tenancy may be arranged for a period of less than 30 days is classified under the "Visitor Accommodation" category). Common accessory uses include recreational activities, raising of pets, gardens, personal storage buildings, hobbies, and parking of the occupants' vehicles. Home occupations and accessory dwelling units are accessory uses that are subject to additional regulations (see subchapter 77-303., Accessory uses and structures). Specific use types include, but are not limited to: 
(a)  Dwelling, condominium. A type of dwelling in which three or more individual dwelling units are attached by one or more vertical party walls, with the habitable spaces of different dwelling units arranged side-by-side, within a cluster or stacked configuration.

Sec. 78-233. - Date set for reinspection. 
    Whenever a violation of this article has been discovered and reported by an inspecting officer, the building inspector shall determine what reasonable time should be required for the elimination of such violation and shall in accordance with such determination set a time for reinspection of the premises. 
(Code 1982, § 9-11-3) 
Sec. 78-234. - Notice of violation and date of reinspection. 
    The building inspector shall give written notice to the owner of such building stating the nature of the violation and the date on which a reinspection shall be made to determine if the violation has been eliminated. No reinspection shall be made until the person responsible for the violation under the provisions of this article shall have been given a reasonable time to eliminate the violation. Any owner may eliminate the violation regardless of cost or may demolish the building to obtain compliance with the provisions of this article. When the building has been declared a nonconforming use, as defined by the zoning ordinance, the owner shall be required to submit an application to repair to the building inspector and to appeal any adverse ruling by the building inspector to the board of appeals for its determination as to whether such structure should be repaired or demolished.

If the building inspector finds, upon such reinspection of the premises, that the violation has not been eliminated, the building inspector shall make a written report, including therein his findings, his estimate of the cost of eliminating the violation by repairs; the assessed valuation of the building as the same appears on the tax rolls of the city; and whether or not, in his opinion, such a violation presents an immediate danger to the public reasonably related to the value of the building. If the cost to eliminate the violation is not reasonably related to the value of the building, and the building inspector has determined that such violation presents an immediate danger to the public, the building inspector shall forward such report to the city council. If the city council, after due consideration, concurs in such findings, such building shall be deemed a public nuisance, and the city council may issue an order that such building be demolished, as shown by the deed records of the county.

If, at the expiration of 30 days from the date of such notice, as shown on the return receipt, the building ordered demolished has not been demolished, the city council may direct the city attorney to file suit in any court of competent jurisdiction, and if such court shall determine such building to be a public nuisance, the building shall be demolished at the expense of the owner by the city, or its contractor. The city shall in each such case receive bids to demolish, which shall include sale to the contractor making such bid all salvageable materials from such building. The net cost of the demolition shall be charged to the owner or other parties entitled thereto. If the cost of demolition exceeds the value of materials of such building or structure, such excess shall be charged as a lien upon the real property on which the building is situated.

Sec. 78-262. - Moving structures into and across the city (license and bond required for movers). 
(a)  No person, except a licensed mover, referred to in this article as a "mover" shall move any building or structure across, over, along or through any sidewalk, street, or alley or highway, public way or public place, within the corporate limits of the city, except as specifically provided in this article. Every such mover, before engaging in such moving, shall have made application to the building inspector for a license, and such license shall have been approved and issued for the current year. The fee for such license shall be an amount established by resolution of the city council per annum, payable on January 1 and shall be prorated to the nearest month. Before such license is issued, the applicant shall file with the city secretary a surety bond with form approved by the city, in the sum of not less than $5,000.00, saving and keeping the city harmless from any and all costs, damages and suits that it may incur or become liable on, in consequence of the injury to any person or private property in any manner occasioned in or about the moving of buildings, or structures, and to pay for any and all damages to public property that might arise from the use of any of its streets, alleys, boulevards or other public places in the moving or buildings or structures. Such bond shall contain a provision for a ten-day written notice to the city of cancellation by the surety; and provided, further that the applicant shall also file with the city secretary a public liability and property damage insurance policy certificate naming the applicant as the assured, and providing for the payment of any liability imposed by law upon such applicant to the extent of $10,000.00 each person for bodily injury liability, and $20,000.00 for bodily injury liability each accident, and $5,000.00 each accident property damage liability. 
(b)  Upon execution of such bond and certificate and their approval by the city, the building inspector shall inspect, or cause to be inspected, the equipment and facilities to be used by such mover and shall determine that the size, design, safety features and equipment of the vehicle and appurtenances are such that their operation on public property shall not cause damage to the pavement of other public improvements and that the knowledge and experience of the operators is such that the operation of such equipment shall not create a hazard or inconvenience to the public; and, upon approval of such equipment and facilities and payment of the license fee, the license shall be issued to such mover. The license and policy shall run concurrently with the bond, and all such licensees shall expire on December 31 next following. It shall be unlawful for any mover to lend, rent or transfer his license, or any right therein contained, to any person or for any person to make use of any such rights that are not actually his own. Moving subcontractors shall be licensed and bonded as provided in this section. No licensed mover shall allow his name to be used by any person, directly or indirectly, to obtain moving permits except as provided in this section. 
(c)  Nothing in this section shall require a license for the movement of super-heavy or oversized equipment for the transportation of commodities over any state or federal highway within the city limits of the city when such movement is with a valid permit from the state highway department, as required by Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 6701-A, and when evidence of such permit is presented to the building inspector.

Sec. 78-263. - Permits for moving and building permit. 
(a)  Required. No building or structure shall be moved over, or along any street, public way or public place, within the city until the mover has first obtained a moving permit, and, if such structure is to be moved to a place within the city, a building permit must also be obtained. 
(b)  Moving permit. Moving permits shall be issued only to licensed movers by the building inspector. Where the structure is to be moved to a location within the city, a moving permit may not be issued unless issued after the issuance of a regular building permit. The building inspector of the city shall collect the mover, in connection with the issuance of the moving permit, a moving and inspection fee established by resolution of the city council, where a structure is to be moved to a location within the city or moved in such a manner that it will pass over or through any part of the city, but will be located and finally placed at a point outside the city. Independent school districts and all churches in the city shall be exempt from all inspection fees and moving fees. However, such exemption does not relieve any school district or church from posting the necessary bond and taking out the necessary permits to do such moving, nor shall such exemption to be construed as to allow the moving into the city of any building precluded by the ordinances of the city. 
(c)  Building permit fee where the structure is to be moved to a location within the city. Where the structure is to be moved to a location within the city, the building inspector shall collect the fee provided for new construction in the city and inspect the structure as provided by the building code. If the inspection reveals that such building does not comply with the requirements of the ordinances of the city and may not be brought into or placed within the city, only the building permit fee required hereby shall be charged. In no event shall a moving permit be issued until the building permit has been issued. Also, no building permit shall be issued unless the building inspector has inspected the structure to be moved into the city and provided the owner with a list of requirements which must be completed before a certificate of occupancy will be issued. In each case, whether listed or not, the owner of the house being moved into the city will have to bring such into compliance with all the building ordinances and codes of the city, and failure to do so shall be a violation of this article, even though a certificate of occupancy has been issued. 
(Code 1982, § 9-6-3; Ord. No. 022-07, § 1, 8-7-2007) 
Sec. 78-264. - Applications for moving permit. 
(a)  Any mover desiring to move a building into or across the city shall file with the building inspector a written application setting forth the type and kind of building to be moved; the original cost of such building; the extreme dimensions of length, height and width of the building; its present location and proposed new location by lot, block, subdivision and street numbers; the approximate time such building will be upon the street; and the contemplated route that will be taken from present to new location; and, such other information as may be required by the building inspector. 
(b)  Before such application for a permit is made, the house mover shall make arrangements with the public utilities, railroads, and other persons whose facilities are involved in such movements, for the removal, relocation and replacement of wires, poles, or other improvements, to enable the building or structure to be moved with proper clearance as provided in this article. 
(c)  The application and other information furnished by the applicant shall be examined and the building or structure sought to be moved, inspected, as provided for in this article, by the building inspector; and, if found to be in conformity with the requirements of this article and with all other laws and ordinances applicable thereto, and the building inspector has issued the owner thereof a building permit, he shall issue a moving permit to the mover, upon receipt of the required fees, as provided for in this article. 
(d)  Upon issuance of such permit, the building inspector shall cause notice to be given to the police and fire department, and the house mover shall notify the railroads and any other person who may be affected by the temporary obstruction of the street and/or right-of-way. If the exact time of the move is not known when the moving permit is issued, the mover shall also be required to notify the police, building inspector and fire department when the move is to be made and the actual time of the move must be approved by the building inspector. 
(Code 1982, § 9-6-4) 
Sec. 78-265. - Additional building requirements. 
    In addition to all other requirements of the building code or building ordinances, all buildings moved to any place within the city shall be completely painted on the outside surfaces and adequate windows, window screens and doors shall be attached to such building. However, the painting requirements in this section shall be waived if the building, when located, is veneered with brick or other building stone, or is covered with asbestos or other finished siding and all trim has been painted. Such painting or veneering and any outside repair work required by the building inspector shall be done within the time prescribed by the building inspector in the building permit, and any extension of such time shall be granted by the city manager only. The building inspector is hereby directed to include in the requirements conditioning the building permit, such requirements necessary to make the finished structure compatible with the other structures within the area. If a structure is to be moved into an area containing only brick or building stone homes, the structure to be moved must be of a similar material or veneered with brick or other building stone after the move. In such a case, the building inspector shall make this a requirement or condition to the issuance of the building permit. No moving permit shall be issued by the building inspector for the location of a modular type building or a portable type building within the city which is conducted of such material or in such a way as to make it incompatible with other buildings within the area. Any person shall have the right to appeal any decision of the building inspector directly to the city board of adjustment.

(b)  Number and location. There shall be a minimum of five red lights placed on each street side of the building. Such red lights shall be attached to the building in such a fashion as to indicate extreme width, height and size. 
(c)  Flares required. There shall be placed, in addition to the red lights on the building, flares at regular intervals for a distance of 200 feet up the street on each side of the building. 
(d)  Flaggers required. When more than 50 percent of the street, measured between curbs, is occupied at night by the building, or when in the opinion of the building inspector, flaggers are necessary to divert or caution traffic, the owner or person moving such building shall employ at their expense, two flagmen, one at each street intersection beyond the building. Such flaggers shall remain at these intersections, diverting or cautioning traffic from sunset to sunrise. Red lights shall be employed in flagging traffic at night. 
(Code 1982, § 9-6-7) 
Sec. 78-268. - Compliance with codes. 
    Any residence or other building brought into the city shall comply with all of the requirements of the electrical code, plumbing code, building code and zoning code ordinance of the city, and it shall be illegal and an offense to bring into the city any building which does not comply with the requirements of the electrical code, plumbing code, building code and zoning code.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 82-31. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water Code, Section 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Rowlett, Texas does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 023-08, § 1, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 82-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Rowlett are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 023-08, § 1, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 82-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 023-08, § 1, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 82-34. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 023-08, § 1, 9-2-2008)

(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 82-45(b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this article, the board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this article (see, section 82-33 of this article). 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in this division are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  All manufactured homes to be placed within zone A on the city's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the city's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at two feet above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's FIRM shall either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of section 82-45(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 023-08, § 1, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 82-49. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections 82-33, 82-34 and 82-35 of this article. 
(2)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of sections 82-36 and 82-45, and division 5 of this article. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to sections 82-37 and 82-44(8) of this article. 
(4)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(5)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 023-08, § 1, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 82-50. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 82-37 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the city's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall; 
a.  have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the city's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 82-45 are satisfied. 
(4)  Within Zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 023-08, § 1, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 82-51. - Floodways. 
    Floodways-Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 82-37 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 023-08, § 1, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 82-52. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this article is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 023-08, § 1, 9-2-2008) 
Sec. 82-53. - Penalties for non-compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and all other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this article by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation, all such remedies being herein declared cumulative.

Sec. 98-51. - Purpose and intent of division. 
    The purpose of this division is to encourage the preservation of mature tress which once removed can be replaced only after generations, to preserve protected trees during construction and to control the removal of protected trees when necessary. It is the intent of this division to achieve the following: 
(1)  Prohibit the indiscriminate clearing of property. 
(2)  Protect and increase the value of residential and commercial properties within the city. 
(3)  Maintain and enhance a positive image for the attraction of new business enterprises to the city. 
(4)  Protect healthy quality trees and promote the natural ecological environmental and aesthetic qualities of the city. 
(5)  Help provide needed shaded areas in order to provide relief from the heat by reducing the ambient temperature.

Sec. 98-52. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Critical root zone means the area of undisturbed natural soil around a tree defined by a concentric circle with a radius equal to the distance from the trunk to the outermost portion of the drip line. 
    DBH (diameter-at-breast-height (caliper)) means tree trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of four and one-half feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, the tree shall be measured in two places, the narrowest point beneath the split and one-half the sum of the calipers of the trunks immediately above the split. Whichever is the greater measurement is to be the measurement applied. If there is no single trunk above ground level to measure, the measurement shall be the sum of the main trunk, plus one-half of all other branches of the calipers of the various trunks at breast height. 
    Drip line means a vertical line run through the outermost portion of the canopy of a tree and extending to the ground. 
    Governmental entity means the city, independent school districts, state and county property; property owned by the United States of America or other federal agencies. Examples of this would include city hall, public parks, Corps of Engineers property, state R.O.W., library, fire stations, water tower sites or similar properties. 
    Multi-trunk tree means a tree with more than one trunk arising at or near the ground. 
    Protective fencing means snow fencing, chain link fence, barbed wire fence, orange vinyl construction fencing or other similar fencing with a four foot approximate height. 
    Replacement tree means a self-supporting woody perennial plant listed on the Approved Replacement Trees (Appendix "B") grouping at the end of the ordinance; a single tree, or multiple trees, at least four-inch caliper each, when added together equals one and one-half times the DBH measurement of the protected tree removed, measured 12 inches above the root ball per current Texas Nurserymen's Association specifications, as amended, as approved by the director of planning and community development and or the director's designee. Trees in any proposed street or alley right-of-way shall be replaced when added together at one-half of the diameter of the trees removed. 
    Tree, protected means a tree the trunk of which has a DBH of eight inches (approximate 25-inch circumference), that is not one of the following trees: Tree of Heaven, Mimosa or Silktree, Sugarberry, Horseapple/Bois D'Arc, Chinaberry, Black Willow, Chinese Tallow, Siberian Elm, Cotton Wood, Hackberry (11-inch DBH or smaller), Lotus (Buckthorn Family). 
    Tree valuation means as established by the National Arborist Association per the Tree Valuation Schedule (appendix C) which is on file in the city secretary's office and made a part of this division by reference.

Subdivision V. - Regulations 

Sec. 98-141. - Tree replacement requirements. 
(a)  Generally. If it is necessary to remove a protected tree, the applicant shall be required to replace the protected tree being removed with an approved replacement tree. 
(b)  Replacement restriction. Any required replacement tree shall not be planted within an area such that the mature canopy of the tree will interfere with overhead utility lines, or that the mature root zone of the tree interferes with underground public utility lines. 
(c)  Landscaping plans. Trees required to be added per the landscaping requirements in the subdivision requirements in chapter 94 or in the zoning regulations in chapter 102 or by virtue of deed restrictions shall not be considered as replacement trees. 
(d)  Credit for saved trees. Credit is granted for a protected tree being saved only when it is clearly demonstrated by the applicant that a building pad, driveway aisle, parking lot, street or other improvement has been modified to preserve a protected tree. For every protected tree that is saved, the developer shall receive a credit of two caliper inches that do not have to be replaced. That is, if a lot has 100 protected trees and the developer saves 50 protected trees, they shall receive a credit of 100 caliper inches that do not have to be replaced. The exception shall be designated floodplain areas. 
(e)  Protected tree mitigation. As set forth in this article, a protected tree shall be replaced with a replacement tree or trees. In lieu thereof, a replacement tree escrow fee may be paid. The following protected tree mitigation options are available: 
(1)  Planted on the same site (subject property) as the removed protected tree; 
(2)  Planted within a specified city designated park or other city-owned property/facility; 
(3)  Planted within a specified private open space (i.e. private park, preserve, or similar property that is open for public use); 
(4)  Planted within a specified public right-of-way median; or 
(5)  Pay a fee in lieu of planting a replacement tree. 
A specified planting area shall be recommended by the city plan review committee (PRC), then forwarded to the city tree board for consensus, and approved by the director of planning and community development or his designee. 
(f)  Replacement tree escrow fee. In lieu of planting a replacement tree, a monetary value (escrow fee) for required replacement tree inches shall be assessed and paid by the property owner prior to issuance of a building permit for site improvements, infrastructure construction, or other work on the subject property. The monetary value of a replacement tree, as outlined herein, shall be calculated on the average market cost of trees within the Dallas metro area as recommended by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). 
The city forester shall determine the monetary value of a replacement tree by contacting landscape companies, plant nurseries, or garden centers for the price of a three-inch caliper tree installed, then averaging that cost to determine the mean cost of a three-inch tree; and then dividing by three to determine the mean cost of a one-inch tree installed. The mean cost of a one-inch tree installed is then multiplied by the required number of replacement tree inches proposed for fee payment in lieu of planting. Said formula is represented as follows: 
((A+B+C)/3)/3 * X = Replacement Tree Escrow Fee 
Where A, B and C represent the installed cost of a three inch tree from three sources, and where X represents the required number of replacement tree inches. 
(g)  Reforestation fund. The director of planning and community development or his designee shall assess escrow fees paid in lieu of replacement tree planting during submission and review of a tree survey/preservation plan and/or tree removal permit application. Fees shall be collected prior to issuance of a building permit, and deposited into the reforestation fund, which is maintained by the parks and recreation department.

Sec. 98-143. - Prohibited activities. 
    The following activities shall be prohibited within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree subject to the requirements of this division: 
(1)  Material storage. No materials intended for use in construction or waste materials accumulated due to excavation or demolition shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree. 
(2)  Equipment cleaning/liquid disposal. No equipment shall be cleaned or other liquids deposited or allowed to flow overland within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree. This would include paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or similar materials. 
(3)  Tree attachments. No signs, wires or other attachments, other than those of a protective nature shall be attached to any protected tree. 
(4)  Vehicular traffic. No vehicular and/or construction equipment traffic or parking shall take place within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree other than on an existing street pavement. This restriction does not apply to single incident access within a critical root zone for purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for routine utility maintenance or emergency restoration of utility service or routine mowing operations. 
(5)  Grade changes. No grade changes (cut or fill) shall be allowed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree unless adequate construction methods are approved by the director of planning and community development or his/her designee. 
(6)  Impervious paving. No paving with asphalt, concrete or other impervious materials in a manner which may reasonably be expected to kill a tree shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree 
(Code 1982, § 9-17-8.1; Ord. No. 7-6-99C, § 1, 7-6-1999) 
Sec. 98-144. - Prior to construction. 
    The following procedures shall be followed on all types of construction projects (i.e., residential subdivisions, commercial, multi-family manufacturing developments, residential builders and municipal/public): 
(1)  Tree flagging. All protected trees on the subject property within 40 feet of a construction area or surface improvements such as driveway, walks, etc., shall be flagged with bright fluorescent orange vinyl tape wrapped around the main trunk at a height of four feet or more such that the tape is very visible to workers operating construction equipment. This shall not include the flagging of all protected trees adjacent to R.O.W. within approved residential subdivisions during the construction of the roadway. 
(2)  Open space flagging. All trees or groups of trees within areas intended to be saved as open space shall be enclosed with fluorescent orange tape along all areas of possible access or intrusion by construction equipment. Tape shall be supported at a maximum of 25-foot intervals by wrapping trees or other approved methods. Single incident access for the purposes of clearing underbrush is allowed. 
(3)  Protective fencing. Protective fencing will be located at the drip lines of all protected trees that border the limits of construction. In situations where a protected tree is located within the immediate area of intended construction, protective fencing will be located at the drip line. 
(4)  Bark protection. In situations where a protected tree remains in the immediate area of intended construction, the tree shall be protected by enclosing the entire circumference of the tree with two-inch by four-inch lumber encircled with wire or other means that do not damage the tree. The intent here is to protect the bark of the tree against incidental contact by large construction equipment. 
(Code 1982, § 9-17-8.2; Ord. No. 7-6-99C, § 1, 7-6-1999) 
Sec. 98-145. - Permanent construction methods. 
(a)  Boring. Boring of utilities under protected trees may be required in certain circumstances. When required, the length of the bore shall be the width of the critical root zone at a minimum and shall be a minimum depth of 48 inches. 
(b)  Trenching. All trenching where possible shall be designed to avoid trenching across the critical root zone of any protected tree. This shall not inhibit the placement of necessary underground services such as electric, telephone, gas, etc. 
(c)  Root pruning. It is recommended that all roots two inches or larger in diameter which are exposed as a result of trenching or other excavation be cut off square with a sharp medium tooth saw and covered with pruning compound within two hours of initial exposure. 
(Code 1982, § 9-17-8.3; Ord. No. 7-6-99C, § 1, 7-6-1999) 
Sec. 98-146. - Maintenance after development. 
    If any of the trees required to be retained or trees planted as a part of this division should die within a period of one year after completion of the activities associated with construction, the owner of the property shall replace the trees within six months at a ratio of one-to-one with an approved identical size tree from the tree replacement list which is the same size as the tree removed. 
(Code 1982, § 9-17-9; Ord. No. 7-6-99C, § 1, 7-6-1999) 
Sec. 98-147. - Issuance of permit; conditions. 
    No building permit shall be issued unless the applicant signs an application or permit request which states that all construction activities shall meet the requirements of this division. The chief building official shall make available to the applicant a copy of this division. 
(Code 1982, § 9-17-11; Ord. No. 7-6-99C, § 1, 7-6-1999) 
Sec. 98-148. - Tree pruning restrictions. 
(a)  Generally. No protected tree shall be pruned in such a manner which significantly disfigures the tree or in a manner which would reasonably lead to the death of a tree, except where such pruning is necessary for safety and electrical reliability. 
(b)  Permit requirements. All utility companies shall be required to file in the office of the director of planning and community development or his/her designee a set of pruning specifications (updated annually) to be followed by all pruning contractors working for the company within the city. Prior to beginning any pruning not requested by the owner of the tree, the contractor shall submit to the city an application for a pruning permit for approval. Such permit shall be effective for a one year period. As allowed in section 98-123(2), utility companies may prune trees as necessary to re-establish disrupted utility service without obtaining a permit. 
(c)  Pruning standards. All pruning shall be in accordance with the National Arborist Association Standards for Pruning of Shade Trees which shall be on file in the office of the director of planning and community development.

SECTION 1. - INTRODUCTION 
BACKGROUND 
    This master thoroughfare plan (MTP) is a component of the Rowlett comprehensive plan (CP). The future land use plan map (FLUP) recommendations in the CP must have land uses so situated that the ability to move people, goods, and services safely and efficiently can be achieved, or else the functions of the FLUP will be severely limited. Therefore, this MTP has to be a component of the CP because of the inseparability between land use and the transportation system. This Rowlett MTP establishes a vital link between land use and transportation facilities and services needed to support growth. 
    While it can be argued that the transportation system is global, for purposes of this MTP, the broadest context is the North Central Texas Council of Governments Mobility 2025 Plan. This plan serves the COG region and is COG's latest long-range (metropolitan) transportation plan. Within the mobility plan area, is the draft Combined Rowlett/Sachse/Murphy/Wylie Thoroughfare Plan, which was prepared by COG with technical assistance by the staffs of these four municipalities. The data in this proposed four-city plan serves as the subregional context for this Rowlett MTP.

SECTION 2. - GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES 
INTRODUCTION 
    A fundamental purpose of the Rowlett MTP is to coordinate the movement of people, goods, and services through and within the city. The goals, objectives and policies in the plan are produced to serve the public interest. Individual proposals for transportation services may at times be in conflict with the literal application of these guidelines. Therefore, all goals may not be met in all instances, and their application by the city planning and zoning commission and city council will reflect a weighing of the issues involved in resolving the conflicts that naturally arise in individual circumstances. 
    The goals, objectives and policies (G, O, & P) of the MTP are designed to create a safe and efficient transportation system for all persons who live, work, or visit within the city. In addition to providing the planning basis and overall direction for transportation functions in Rowlett, the G,O & P can serve as a "checklist" by which to determine to what extent individual transportation planning proposals and/or recommendations have met the Rowlett MTP principles and criteria. 
DEFINITIONS OF TERMS 
Goal: The general statement of Rowlett's transportation aspirations, values and concerns in relation to its physical development. Goals recognize the needs, problems, and opportunities that exist within the community and imply a commitment to work toward this common purpose. A statement of the general transportation aspirations and desires of the city, broad in scope and long-range in perspective. Objective: Observable identifiable benchmarks by which the city can measure progress toward the realization of its goals. A statement aimed at furthering the transportation goals of Rowlett, but more specific, measurable and short-range than the goals themselves. Policy: An officially adopted statement by the city council establishing a course of action designed to achieve the goals. A statement indicating a method of achieving the city's goals and objectives. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES Goal:1 To establish an integrated transportation network which will enable the safest and most efficient movement of people, services and goods within the framework of the Rowlett environment. Objective:1 To minimize safety hazards and provide for the most efficient movement of traffic within all areas of the community. Objective:2 To relate the master thoroughfare plan to development considerations represented in the comprehensive plan. Policy:2-1 To seek right-of-way acquisition in all cases necessary to improve thoroughfare continuity, efficiency, and functioning. Policy:2-2 To require right-of-way dedication as specified by the master thoroughfare plan. Policy:2-3 To acquire, as feasible and required, right-of-way to allow turning lanes, both left and free right, at the intersection of all arterial streets and frontage roads. Policy:2-4 To specify intersection designs and right-of-way alignments, where possible, as part of the master thoroughfare plan. Policy:2-5 To require sequential dedication of collector street systems in those areas of the community that are undeveloped. Objective:3 To develop guidelines and procedures to evaluate the traffic impact of proposed projects, so as to ensure that the thoroughfare system is in balance with the development of land in the city. Objective:4 To provide opportunities for the use of all appropriate modes of transportation. Policy:4-1 To require appropriate access to all means of transportation serving the city. Objective:5 To create a hierarchy of nonresidential thoroughfares, so size and design of driveways can be related to their use. Policy:5-1 To minimize and reduce the number of driveways onto arterial streets and collectors, and to provide only the number of driveways necessary to support the intended land use, driveways shall be limited to one per business. Multiple driveways into businesses may be allowed for larger developments, and shared driveways between businesses shall be encouraged. This policy can aid in minimizing traffic movement conflicts. Policy:5-2 Residential and rail street crossings should be minimized. New residential subdivisions will not have at-grade railway crossings by local, minor or collector streets unless no other access is feasible. Policy:5-3 Thoroughfare and railway intersection grade separation is encouraged when feasible and practical. Proper signalization of at-grade intersections is intended. Objective:6 The proper level of accessibility and service shall be provided to each land use and activity. Objective:7 Existing deficient streets within Rowlett shall be identified and included in future capital improvement programs. Objective:8 Through traffic and industrial and commercial traffic shall be prevented in residential areas. Policy:8-1 The network of major roadways shall be designed, constructed and improved according to the right-of-way standards in this master thoroughfare plan. The definition of major roadways should be consistent throughout the Rowlett development codes and ordinances. Policy:8-2 Through traffic and commercial and industrial traffic in residential areas and neighborhoods will be prevented by facilitating traffic flow around and interrupting flow within those residential areas and neighborhoods and by continuing enforcement of municipal traffic codes. Policy:8-3 The traffic safety and carrying capacities of roadways shall be preserved and maintained by preventing incompatible land uses from developing along roadways and by limiting the number and location of curb cuts on thoroughfare streets and highways. Policy:8-4 Local, state and federal assistance will be secured as feasible to construct new and replacement facilities and to maintain and improve roadways as needed. Goal:2 Rowlett shall plan thoroughfare systems, including local street networks, land uses, and zoning to aid in ensuring that these planning functions will be provided efficiently and effectively to existing and new residential and nonresidential developments. Goal:3 In order to maintain and/or enhance regional mobility, tollway, freeway, highway, and arterial improvements shall be designed to alleviate existing traffic congestion problems, enhance high-occupancy vehicle and transit operations, and provide access to new desired growth areas, as identified in adopted land use plans. As feasible, said mobility will, as well, be directed toward providing optimum service to existing developments. Goal:4 As feasible, transportation goals, objectives, and policies will be consistent and compatible with elements of and recommendations within the Rowlett comprehensive plan, which includes the future land use plan map. Goal:5 As feasible, Rowlett will develop a transportation system that will aid in integrating regional, county-wide, and local (Rowlett) transit service and transportation needs and systems. Goal:6 It is intended that an economical and efficient alternative means of transportation be provided to Rowlett that can supplement the use of the automobile. Goal:7 As part of the Rowlett downtown plan, the city will prepare transit-oriented development land use plans and land use regulations that can promote high-density development and mixed uses at and/or near the Rowlett DART station. Site design should encourage land uses compatible with pedestrian, transit and as necessary, motorized vehicle activity, in the Rowlett DART environs and the downtown planning area. Goal:8 The city should coordinate with landowners and developers to cooperatively fund and develop a master plan for the technological/research (T-R) zoning district. The T-R district should include pedestrian and bicycle access for use by commuters and employee recreation, landscape enhancements and cohesive site design. Goal:9 Rowlett's transportation system should aid in improving the mobility of residents and businesses so that they have greater (as warranted and as feasible) access to housing, jobs, goods and services, shopping and recreation, all of which are characteristics of a high quality of life. Policy:9-1-A Rowlett staff and officials should continue ongoing coordination with regional transportation-oriented agencies, county agencies and adjacent and nearby municipalities to aid in ensuring the continuous planning (as necessary) and development of multimodal transportation systems. This will aid in ensuring orderly land use and transportation system growth and development, at the regional and local levels. Goal:10 The Rowlett MTP should continue to be consistent with the recommendations and future land use plan element in the Rowlett comprehensive Plan. Goal:11 Rowlett's road design and construction standards shall promote safe, cost-effective roads that encourage multimodal use, and reflect the different needs within the community. Goal:12 Commercial, industrial and both multifamily and single-family residential developments should be encouraged to develop highly connective street networks to promote better accessibility by all modes. Goal:13 Safe pedestrian crossings across arterials should be provided at or near pedestrian activity centers (e.g., schools, retail centers, clustered housing, transit centers, trail crossings, etc.). Goal:14 This Rowlett MTP should be updated periodically as needed, and should always be reviewed and updated as required, when the Rowlett comprehensive plan is reviewed or updated. Policy:14-1 The city will encourage public involvement throughout the development of the MTP and subsequent revisions. Policy:14-2 The Rowlett MTP should be consulted as part of the annexation and incorporation process, to aid in ensuring that the transportation system remains efficient and that as necessary, interjurisdictional issues are addressed. Policy:14-3 To continue the establishment, maintenance, and enhancement of the transportation system, intergovernmental coordination should occur as appropriate. Goal:15 Rowlett officials and staff will continue to recognize the need for an overall regional transportation vision that can address potential conflicts and avoid lack of coordination that could result in a piecemeal approach regarding multimodal transportation elements, in both the region and the City of Rowlett.

SECTION 3. - THE REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE 
INTRODUCTION 
    Transportation planning and functions extend beyond the borders of municipalities. Therefore, this MTP will discuss the regional planning perspective regarding transportation planning, so that the local Rowlett MTP perspective can be placed in context. 
THE DRAFT COMBINED ROWLETT/SACHSE/MURPHY/WYLIE THOROUGHFARE PLAN 
    The following information in this section 3 represents a synopsis of the Draft Combined Rowlett/Sachse/Murphy/Wylie Thoroughfare Plan. This information was prepared by NCTCOG (on September 12, 2000) to aid the Rowlett city council and the planning and zoning commission during their joint work session held in November, 2000 to address this four-city thoroughfare plan (MTP). This joint work session served to refine the four-city draft MTP, which led to the specific Rowlett MTP recommendations described in section 4 of this document. The COG staff has indicated that it intends to finalize this four-city MTP after the proposed President George Bush Turnpike (PGBT) (formerly known as SH 190) alignment is finalized. That updated COG plan will also include modeling of the finalized PGBT alignment in addition to modeling the Rowlett MTP recommendations as described in section 5 of this Rowlett MTP and as adopted by the Rowlett city council. The purpose, therefore, is to ultimately have a four-city MTP integrated with the Rowlett MTP (as per the specific recommendations in section 4 of this document). This COG synopsis is comprised of 21 pages. However, Rowlett staff removed pages 15 and 18 which describe roadway classifications and cross sections that are currently not compatible with Rowlett designations. Rowlett and COG staff intend to make these designations compatible as part of future MTP updates.

SECTION 4. - THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE 
INTRODUCTION 
    The essence of the Rowlett MTP is reflected in this section regarding the local perspective, which focuses mainly on the transportation modes that service the City of Rowlett. However, as stated earlier, the local perspective takes on greater meaning as understood within the regional perspective, previously discussed. 
    The data described in the regional perspectives section, therefore, serves as the broader context by which to place the Rowlett local perspective. Further, this section 5 represents a refinement of the Draft Combined Rowlett/Sachse/Murphy/Wylie Thoroughfare Plan. This refinement has been prepared by the Rowlett planning and zoning commission, city council and staff. Also, this refinement represents the more detailed and precise Rowlett MTP needs based on the understanding of Rowlett officials and staff. 
A MULTIMODAL SYSTEM 
    This Rowlett MTP is a multimodal plan. The term "multimodal" means that a community uses a variety of systems to transport people, goods, and services, and for a variety of reasons. Therefore, Rowlett has the following transportation modes that can serve the city: 
 D/FW, Love Field, and local airports. These airport facilities serve Rowlett residents and businesses for international, national, and regional aircraft services. 
 Amtrak. This national commuter railroad system can serve Rowlett residents through station locations within the Dallas area. There could be direct connection to Amtrak via future DART light-rail linkage. 
 M, K & T Railroad. This railroad provides the city and the region with freight-hauling services. 
 Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). This commuter light-rail system will serve Rowlett citizens and will provide light-rail linkages to other municipalities and areas in the Dallas area. It will aid in enhancing Rowlett's and the regions economic development, as well as the quality of life. 
 Bus system. The bus system is a function of the DART light-rail program and therefore serves to integrate these two systems. Also, the school districts provide school buses to accommodate students attending school in the Rowlett area. 
 The road thoroughfare system. 
 This Rowlett MTP mainly addresses the road thoroughfare system serving Rowlett and its region. 
 Hike and bike trail system. This movement system will add to the citizens' quality of life, and can also be perceived as a component of and linkage to the Rowlett park, recreation, and open-space system. As such, it will also add to Rowlett's already excellent quality of life. 
 Lake Ray Hubbard. The use of watercraft on Lake Ray Hubbard represents a quality of life factor in Rowlett and is also part of the city's recreational system. 
 Pedestrian-oriented conceptual downtown plan. City staff has begun preliminary evaluations toward the purpose of developing a downtown plan that will have, among its features, pedestrian-oriented elements that will enhance the human scale and walkability within the Rowlett downtown district. Also, within this downtown plan area, DART facilities will be located, thereby making this light-rail system part of the downtown function. 
 The collector system for the technological research (T-R) zoning district. (See the Rowlett master thoroughfare plan map in this section.) 
THE ROWLETT MTP GRAPHICS 
    This section contains four graphics that illustrate the proposed Rowlett MTP. These are: 
 The Rowlett master thoroughfare plan 
 Thoroughfares that currently function as collectors in Rowlett 
 Rowlett hike/bike trail system 
 Combined Rowlett thoroughfare plan (which depicts thoroughfares that function as collectors and the Rowlett MTP). 
All existing and proposed physical developments must be evaluated against these graphic representations on a consistent basis, or else it will be difficult for Rowlett to develop an incremental, efficient, and consistent transportation system. Appropriate coordination with other agencies, and funding are also major plan implementation techniques (see also section 5). 
PROPOSED PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH TURNPIKE - UNFIXED ALIGNMENT 
    The proposed eastern extension of the President George Bush Turnpike (formerly known as SH 190) as depicted on the Rowlett MTP represents a consistent commitment to this proposed location of the corridor and unspecified alignment, as determined and supported by Rowlett city officials since 1994. This roadway project is now being considered as a tollway rather than a freeway at the request of local governments. Because of limited federal and state transportation funding available in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, consideration of this project as a tollway will help finance the project faster and reduce implementation time. See the enclosed map that indicates two alignment alternatives for the proposed President George Bush Turnpike - unfixed alignment, dated February, 2001. 
    This commitment is further reinforced through the State Highway 190 Land Use Corridor Study, City of Rowlett, Texas, (Rowlett Resolution No. 2-21-95C); the Rowlett comprehensive plan (adopted April 24, 1996), and the Rowlett zoning ordinance (adopted March 4, 1997). 
THE PROPOSED COLLECTOR SYSTEM FOR THE TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH (T-R) ZONING DISTRICT 
    The Rowlett MTP map indicates the T-R zoning district and a proposed collector system to serve thoroughfare functions within and adjacent to this T-R district. The benefits of illustrating this collector thoroughfare are the following: 
 The first developer within the district will not dictate the location and configuration of the collector system, thereby potentially disrupting the overall efficient design, functioning, and lotting arrangement within the district. 
 The overall land area within the district will be able to more efficiently function with a collector designed for the purpose of effectively serving all the potential lots and developments within the district. 
 The planning and construction of safer and more efficient access to the President George Bush Turnpike (formerly known as SH 190) can be increased by relating the T-R collector location and configuration in conjunction with the ultimate President George Bush Turnpike (formerly known as SH 190) alignment, frontage road system, and access points. 
 More efficient marketing and design of the T-R district can occur as a result of a collector system better correlated with land use planning and development. 
KIRBY/LIBERTY GROVE ROAD 
    Kirby/Liberty Grove Road shall be planned as a six-lane, divided thoroughfare. However, should President George Bush Turnpike be constructed such that any portion of Kirby/Liberty Grove Road is an access road for the turnpike, those portions shall be constructed with only four lanes of traffic.

SECTION 5. - IMPLEMENTATION 
INTRODUCTION 
    As is true of all plans, in order to be effective, they must be implemented. The following implementation techniques will serve to implement this Rowlett MTP: 
 Although this could be a transportation goal, an implementation tool would be to identify and prioritize transportation system needs to meet current and future travel demands, based on the Rowlett comprehensive plan. Such prioritization can include financial payment opportunities, in conjunction with the staging and development of future utility systems within Rowlett. 
IMPLEMENTATION TECHNIQUES 
 Coordination with the completed Combined Rowlett/Sachse/Murphy/Wylie Thoroughfare Plan and the Rockwall County Thoroughfare Plan (adopted). This coordination will provide regional integration to aid in continued safe and efficient transportation functioning. 
 Coordination with the Rowlett comprehensive plan, Rowlett zoning ordinance, Rowlett subdivision regulations (and other applicable city plans, codes and ordinances.) This MTP is actually a major component of the Rowlett comprehensive plan (CP). Therefore, recommendations in the CP must be coordinated with the recommendations in this MTP to aid in achieving compatibility with land use and transportation requirements. Similarly, the MTP recommendations must be coordinated with the requirements in the Rowlett zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations, and other applicable city plans, codes, and ordinances. 
 Coordination with Rowlett development reviews. The goals, objectives and policies in conjunction with the MTP maps in section 4 that depict the recommended Rowlett transportation system must be consulted and enforced as part of the development review process for zoning, platting, and site plan evaluations. It is at this level that the Rowlett long-range transportation-planning program must be initiated. Not to do so could cost lost opportunities that could jeopardize the integrity of the Rowlett MTP system. 
 Capital improvement program (CIP). The CIP serves to prioritize needs and funding related to major programs serving the city. The CIP related to traffic, roads, and transportation will aid in addressing these needs on a priority basis, thereby hopefully adequately providing funds in a timely manner to keep maintenance of road systems at a safe and efficient level, etc., and to otherwise support the on-going establishment of the overall Rowlett transportation system. 
SECTION 6. - CONCLUSION 
    This Rowlett MTP, in conjunction with the Rowlett comprehensive plan, is a major growth-management and traffic management tool. Through the thoughtful planning and implementation of Rowlett's multimodal transportation system, Rowlett's already excellent quality of life will be maintained and enhanced for existing and future generations of Rowlett residents and businesses. 
    The major thoroughfares and collectors reflected in the plan, as well as the hike/bike trail system, are fundamental adjuncts to the ongoing and thoughtful land use planning that has occurred for decades in this city through formal comprehensive planning programs. The rapid growth of Rowlett over the past decades in conjunction with the rapid growth of the surrounding Dallas region is a major call for ongoing and thoughtful land use and transportation planning in the city. As stated in section 5, implementation of this - and other Rowlett plans - must be a consistent commitment by staff and city officials. 
    Finally, citizens, staff, and officials must continuously keep the vision of a city with a high quality of life before them. That long-range vision is a major contributor to the kind of community current and future Rowlett citizens and businesses do and will desire.

SECTION 7. - CONDITIONS OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY OCCUPANCY 
    § 7.01. Use. All structures, wires, cables, equipment, and facilities erected or maintained by [the] grantee within the city shall be located as to cause minimum interference with the proper and intended use of the public rights-of-way and with the rights or reasonable convenience of the owners or occupants of property which adjoins any of such public rights-of-way. The location of all poles, towers, anchors, wires, cables, electronic conductors, conduits, manholes and other structures and appurtenances in, over, under, along, and across the present and future public rights-of-way in the city shall be fixed under the supervision of the city or an authorized agent appointed by the city. [The] grantee agrees to comply with all other city laws, rules, or ordinances that govern the use of public rights-of-way that currently exist or may be applicable during the term of this franchise, provided that such are promulgated under the city's lawful police powers. In the event that there is conflict between requirements of this franchise and other lawful and generally applicable city ordinances governing [the] grantee's ability to use the public rights-of-way, the more strict provisions shall apply. 
    § 7.02. Excavation. [The] grantee may excavate only for the construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, and maintenance of all or a portion of its facilities used to provide cable service under this franchise. In the event a permit may ordinarily be required for any excavation, a permit shall not be required for the installation of facilities to initiate service to a customer's property, or repair or maintenance of existing facilities unless such installation, repair or maintenance requires the breaking of pavement, excavation or boring. [The] grantee shall provide the city written notice within 15 days of any proposed breaking of pavement, excavation, or boring on any public rights-of-way other than for the purposes of installation of facilities to initiate service to a customer's property, or repair or maintenance of existing facilities, prior to the commencement thereof. [The] grantee shall provide the city with notice following any emergency maintenance that required the breaking of pavement, excavation, or boring on the public right-of-way. Property owners or occupants of adjoining property shall be given reasonable notice. No public rights-of-way shall be encumbered by construction, maintenance, removal, restoration, or repair work by [the] grantee for a longer period than shall be necessary to execute such work. When the grantee shall make or cause to be made excavations or shall place obstructions in any public rights-of-way, the public shall be protected by barriers and lights placed, erected, and maintained by the grantee in accordance with any existing or future city, state, or federal requirements. 
    § 7.03. Restoration. The surface of any public rights-of-way disturbed by [the] grantee in laying, constructing, maintaining, operating, using, extending, removing, replacing, or repairing its cable system shall be restored by [the] grantee as soon as is reasonably possible, but in no instance more than 30 days after the completion of the work, under normal operating conditions. The 30-day period shall be extended for days that the grantee is unable to perform the work due to unfavorable weather conditions. In the event restoration is scheduled to take longer than 30 days for any other reason, [the] grantee shall provide the city with written notice as to the reason(s) for the delay. [The] grantee shall restore the public rights-of-way at its cost and expense, to as good a condition as before the commencement of the work, and the restoration shall be maintained by [the] grantee to the satisfaction of the city for one year from the date of completion of such restoration work.

In the event [the] city determines that [the] grantee's use of any of [the] city's public rights-of-way as set forth in this franchise pose an immediate danger to the health, safety or general welfare of the public, [the] city shall have the right to restore or repair [the] same and shall require [the] grantee to pay to the city the reasonable costs incurred regarding [the] same, all without compensation or liability for damages to the grantee unless such damage was caused by the willful misconduct of the city or its agents. 
    § 7.04. Relocation. Whenever by reason of the construction, repair, maintenance, relocation, widening, raising, or lowering of the grade of any public rights-of-way by the city or by the location or manner of construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair of any public property, structure, or facility by the city, it shall be deemed necessary by the city for [the] grantee to move, relocate, change, alter, or modify any of its facilities or structures, such change, relocation, alteration, or modification shall be promptly made by [the] grantee when directed in writing to do so by the city. [The] grantee shall pay the cost of such relocation unless there are funds generally available to affected users of the public right-of-way for reimbursement of such costs, in which case [the] grantee shall be entitled to its share of such funding. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the city shall make application for such funds on behalf of the grantee upon request of [the] grantee if [the] grantee cannot make such application itself. In the event [the] grantee, after such notice, fails or refuses to commence, pursue, or complete such relocation work within a reasonable time, the city shall have the authority, but not the obligation, to remove or abate such structures or facilities and to require [the] grantee to pay to the city the reasonable cost of such removal or abatement, all without compensation or liability for damages to [the] grantee unless such damage was caused by the willful misconduct of the city or its agents. 
    § 7.05. Temporary removal of wire for building moving. Upon written request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the city, [the] grantee shall remove, raise, or lower its wires and cables temporarily to permit the moving of houses, buildings, or other bulky structures. The reasonable expense of such temporary removal, raising, or lowering shall be paid by the benefited person, and [the] grantee may require such payment in advance, [the] grantee being without obligation to remove, raise, or lower its wires and cables until such payment shall have been made. [The] grantee shall be given not less than 72 hours' advance written notice to arrange for such temporary wire and cable adjustments. 
    § 7.06. Tree trimming. The grantee shall have the authority to trim trees or other natural growth overhanging any of the cable system in the franchise area so as to prevent branches from coming into contact with the grantee's wires, cables or other equipment that may be damaged due to continued contact. The grantee shall reasonably compensate the city or property owner for any damages caused by such trimming, or shall, at its own expense, replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of such trimming in a mutually agreed manner with the property owner. From time to time, the city council may pass ordinances regulating the trimming or removal of trees on or along city property, and [the] grantee shall comply with these ordinances. 
    § 7.07. Placement of fixtures. [The] grantee shall not place poles, towers, or similar fixtures where the same will interfere with any gas, electric, telecommunications, water hydrant, water main, drainage, sanitary sewer or other facilities located within the city's public rights-of-way as authorized by the city, and all such poles, towers, and similar facilities shall be placed as directed by the city. 
    § 7.08. Approval of plans and specifications. [The] grantee shall provide complete plans and specifications for all construction (with the exception of individual drops) within public rights-of-way to the city. Approval of plans and specifications shall not be unreasonably delayed or denied. In the event of rejection, [the] grantee shall submit revised plans and specifications for approval. This provision shall apply to each construction sequence if the construction is accomplished in phases. 
    § 7.09. Underground installation. In those portions of the city having telephone lines and electric utility lines underground, whether required by ordinance or not, any and all of [the] grantee's lines, cables, and wires shall also be underground. [The] grantee's lines, cables, wires, and similar facilities located above ground prior to the effective date of this franchise shall be relocated underground by [the] grantee at the same time that other aboveground utility lines (e.g., electric and telecommunications lines) located within the immediate vicinity of [the] grantee's facilities are required to be placed underground. [The] grantee shall pay the cost of such relocation unless there are funds generally available to affected users of the public right-of-way for reimbursement of such costs, in which case [the] grantee may be entitled to a share of such funding. It shall be the policy of the city that existing poles for electric and communications purposes be utilized by [the] grantee whenever possible and that underground installation, even when not required, is preferable to the placing of additional poles. 
    § 7.10. Facilities location. From time to time, the city or its representatives, may request identification of the specific location of certain grantee cable system facilities. The grantee agrees to respond to such request within 48 hours of the receipt of the request. In the event that [the] grantee fails to provide the necessary information, and damage is caused to [the] grantee facilities as a direct result of withholding said information, the grantee shall hold the city harmless from all liability, damage, cost or expense resulting from any city action in this regard unless such damage was caused by the willful misconduct of the city or its agents. The city shall have the right to be informed as to matters in connection with or affecting the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operations, and repair of the cable system facilities of the grantee within the public rights-of-way including, but not necessarily limited to, the identification and location of the grantee's cable system facilities within the public rights-of-way and to updates of such information as changes regarding same occur. At a minimum, this requires [the] grantee to maintain on file with the city a current set of strand and trench drawings of the cable system. Such strand and trench maps shall be updated as changes occur in the cable system. In addition to providing the location of [the] grantee's facilities, [the] grantee agrees to obtain facilities location information from other users of the public rights-of-way prior to [the] grantee's construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operations and repair of the cable system facilities. Upon request by the city, the grantee shall furnish the city information relevant to such matters which is prepared, maintained, and available in the ordinary course of business.

In the event that any action, suit or proceeding is brought or claim is made against the city based upon or arising out of any such act or omission of the grantee under this franchise, the city shall give notice in writing of such action, suit, proceeding or claim to the grantee. However, the failure of the city to provide such notice in writing to [the] grantee shall not relieve [the] grantee of its duties and obligations under this section, provided that [the] grantee is given sufficient advance notice to perform its duties under this section. The city shall not and does not by reason of this granting of this franchise, or any failure to act by the city which may impact the grantee's performance under this franchise, assume any liability of [the] grantee whatsoever for injury or death to persons, damage to property, or penalties of any kind whatsoever.

If the identified cable services are being offered by [the] grantee or its affiliates to at least 50 percent of the total subscribers in the comparable systems, the city may require that [the] grantee make available such cable services on the cable system in the city. Should the city determine that [the] grantee shall commence provision of such cable services, the city and [the] grantee shall negotiate a schedule for deployment that takes into consideration the impact on subscriber rates, the ability of [the] grantee to recover the cost of such increased capacity or cable services over the remaining life of the franchise from the incremental revenue derived from such additional cable services, and the financial condition of [the] grantee.

[The] grantee shall, upon the request of the city, provide I-Net capacity according to a design and functionality to be specified by city and the grantee which, at the city's discretion, may be used for noncommercial, nonprofit applications, by the city, its agencies, other governments and their agencies, K-12 schools, libraries, public corporations created by the city, and other nonprofit institutions to the extent that such nonprofit institutions provide public services. In the event that the grantee requires reimbursement of costs to provide, construct, and/or maintain such I-Net, the city will only be required to reimburse [the] grantee based on [the] grantee's incremental cost as defined in Exhibit B. [The] grantee agrees that the city may utilize fibers within the [the] grantee's fiber sheath as may be available for I-Net capacity in order to maximize the cost savings to be realized through paying incremental costs only. In no event will any part of the subscriber network distribution system be utilized to I-Net capacity. The city or its designee shall have the right to control and manage the use of the I-Net provided for herein. The grantee shall, if requested by the city, maintain the I-Net it provides, up to a demarcation point, according to the terms of a maintenance agreement between the parties. The city will be responsible for the incremental costs associated with maintenance of the portion of the I-Net providing capacity to the city. The demarcation point at any city designated facility will generally mean the patch panel, termination block, or other termination device located at each I-Net site, at the point closest to the grantee's facilities where the device transmits signals to and from the I-Net provided by [the] grantee. The cost to the city for the construction of the I-Net shall be no more than the incremental cost of I-Net construction, and there shall be no other charge by the grantee to the city or other authorized user for the use of the I-Net than maintenance as determined in a separate maintenance agreement. The I-Net capacity to any location identified in [Exhibit] C shall be provided within 12 months following a request by the city that [the] grantee construct or provide an I-Net connection to that location. Any additional sites shall be constructed within 18 months following a request by the city that the grantee construct or provide an I-Net connection to that location. The grantee shall cooperate with the city to ensure the most cost-effective construction of the I-Net. Costs of construction shall not exceed the estimate provided by [the] grantee. Upon notification by the city to the grantee to construct an I-Net, the grantee shall provide cost estimates to the city within 30 days of such request, and shall if the city so directs, proceed with such construction upon [the] grantee's receipt of a city purchase order and agreement on method of payment. The city has 60 days from receipt of cost estimates, or as may be required by law, to approve the costs and authorize construction of the I-Net. Prior to a request for I-Net construction by the city to the grantee, [the] grantee shall notify the city at least 120 days in advance of any plans for additional plant construction near the locations in Exhibit C. If the city notifies the grantee within 30 days that it desires to have an I-Net constructed by the grantee, then the same requirements shall apply as are set forth in the previous paragraph following provision for notification by the city to [the] grantee that it desires to have [the] grantee construct an I-Net. Costs of construction shall not exceed the estimate provided by [the] grantee. Within 30 days of the city's request, [the] grantee shall determine the technical and operational feasibility of interconnecting the city's I-Net capacity to an I-Net within any contiguous jurisdiction, and it feasible and subject to mutual agreement, interconnect such capacity to a contiguous jurisdiction designated by the city. The I-Net may only be used for any (a) municipal purpose (proprietary or governmental); (b) educational purpose; (c) public purpose, or for use of the PEG channels. It is understood that the connections to city, county or other governmental institutions and transmissions to and among these institutions fall within the terms above. To the extent allowed by law, cost related fees may be charged by the city to persons other than [the] grantee for use of the I-Net or for the information transmitted via the I-Net. The I-Net may be linked to any other communications network used by the city or to any I-Net user authorized by the city, provided such user is either a public agency or such use is for noncommercial, nonprofit purposes. The I-Net may also be linked to the internet; however, the city (or an entity under the city's control) may not use the I-Net provided by [the] grantee to act as the internet service provider for the general public or any commercial establishments. The city may designate an entity to control and manage the use of the I-Net provided by [the] grantee. The city may not lease, to a third party, any portion of the network that [the] grantee installs or leases to the city without the prior written permission of the grantee; provided that the grantee shall not unreasonably deny such permission, and shall limit denial to those cases where the lease may reasonably be construed as facilitating the provision of a service in competition with the grantee. Moreover, where the purpose of any use is commercial and for profit, such use shall not be allowed without the written permission of [the] grantee. I-Net users will not attach any equipment or otherwise use the I-Net in any way that will interfere with the signal quality and the normal operation of [the] grantee's quality and the normal operation of [the] grantee's cable system in conformity with this franchise or FCC regulations including, but not limited to, regulations pertaining to signal leakage. The city and other I-Net users will not resell access to the I-Net. The parties agree that there shall be no charge for the I-Net provided by [the] grantee other than the incremental construction costs and possible maintenance charges specified in this section and defined in Exhibit B. 
SECTION 11. - PERFORMANCE BONDING 
    § 11.01. Amount. Within 30 days of the effective date of this franchise, the grantee shall furnish and file with the city a performance bond in the amount of $75,000.00. The bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the grantee of all terms and conditions of the franchise. Such performance bond will be in addition to any construction bonding requirements of other lawful and generally applicable city ordinances. 
    § 11.02. Reservation of rights. The rights reserved by the city with respect to the bond are in addition to all other rights the city may have under the franchise extension or any other law. 
    § 11.03. Endorsement. The bond shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled without the consent of the city. The city must be given 30 days' written notice by registered mail, return receipt requested, of intent to cancel or not to renew." 
SECTION 12. - OPERATIONAL STANDARDS 
    § 12.01. Compliance with FCC Rules. At a minimum, [the] grantee shall comply with present and future rules and regulations of the FCC including, but not limited to, technical standards, testing requirements, consumer protection standards and consumer electronics compatibility regulations and all other present and future rules and regulations of the FCC in connection with and relating to the operation of [the] grantee's cable system. Such compliance will not negate or replace any additional requirements identified in this franchise. 
    § 12.02. Technical performance. 
A.  [The] grantee's cable system within the city shall meet or exceed all FCC and other applicable technical and signal quality standards for cable systems, including any such standards or regulations as hereinafter may be amended or adopted to the extent that compliance with such amended standards is mandated by law or regulation. In the event that such amended standards are not mandated by law or regulation, and provide for a less strict performance standard and/or less frequent testing requirements, such modifications will not be included as a part of this franchise unless the city chooses to incorporate by means of a resolution or amendment hereto. 
B.  Antennas, supporting structures, headend and associated equipment, and outside plant used in the cable system shall comply with any applicable federal, state, county, or generally applicable city law. 
C.  [The] grantee shall not design, install or operate its facilities in a manner that will interfere with the signals of any broadcast station, the electrical or telephone system located in any building, the cable system of another franchisee, or individual or master antennas used for receiving television or other broadcast signals. 
D.  If the city contacts [the] grantee prior to the next FCC required test period (e.g., those generally conducted in February and August of each year), a city representative may be present during the testing. Upon request, [the] grantee shall provide summary written reports of the results of such tests to the city. 
E.  [The] grantee shall maintain all of its real property, headend facilities and outside plant in a safe condition. Upon request by the city, [the] grantee shall provide copies of the detailed plant maintenance procedure manuals in existence at the time of the request. 
F.  [The] grantee shall keep and maintain a proper and adequate inventory of maintenance and repair parts for the cable system. [The] grantee shall maintain or otherwise have available a work force of skilled technicians for cable system repair and maintenance. 
G.  Upon request, [the] grantee shall provide the city copies of all correspondence with the FCC related to technical performance of the cable system. In the event that any complaints are filed with the FCC related to the cable system operations, [the] grantee shall provide copies of such complaints as well as the resolution thereof to the city upon request. 
    § 12.03. Parental guidance control. Upon request of a subscriber, [the] grantee shall provide by sale and/or lease a device by which the subscriber can prohibit viewing or use of a particular cable service(s) during periods selected by that subscriber. Subscribers shall be notified individually, in writing, by the grantee of the availability of the device no less frequently than annually. 
    § 12.04. Customer service. The grantee shall provide customer service in accordance with the city's customer service standards set forth in Exhibit A. Such standards shall apply to all affiliates that provide cable services to the subscribers, or any other company that provides cable services under written agreement with the grantee. 
    § 12.05. Quality of service. Throughout the term of this franchise, the grantee shall maintain the quality of service and meet operational standards in the maintenance and operation of its cable system as are required herein. In the event that the city elects to do so, the city may monitor the grantee's quality of service by means of surveying selected test sites on a regular basis. Such test site, as well as the intervals in which the surveys may be conducted will be at the sole discretion of the city. The city shall give the grantee 30 days' written notice of the selection of test site(s) prior to beginning the surveys. In addition, the city may delete and/or add any test site, provided that the grantee is given the 30-day written notice prior to such action. Should the city find that the grantee has failed to maintain such quality of service or operational standards, the city may notify the grantee in writing and specifically set forth therein the improvements required to rectify such deficiencies. 
    § 12.06. City's right to evaluate technical performance. The city shall have the right to conduct detailed evaluations of the technical performance of the cable system during the term of the franchise. [The] grantee shall reimburse the city for its costs to conduct one such evaluation during the term of this franchise. The amount of the reimbursement shall be a maximum of $10,000.00. Additional evaluations shall be at the cost of the city. 
SECTION 13. - SIGNALS TO BE CARRIED 
    § 13.01. Required programming categories. [The] grantee shall carry at least four hours per day at a minimum, programming classified under each of the following broad categories:

    § 13.02 Service for the hearing impaired. [The] grantee shall comply with any FCC or other federal or state requirements regarding altering or adapting programming for the hearing impaired. [The] grantee shall not take any action to remove or alter closed captioning provided for the hearing impaired as a part of any programming. [The] grantee shall deliver intact such closed captioning in the manner in which it arrives at the headend or from another origination source to the cable system. 
    § 13.03. Interconnection. [The] grantee's subscriber cable system in the city shall be interconnected with contiguous cable systems that are owned and operated by [the] grantee or an affiliate. 
    § 13.04. Use of cable system to provide internet access by multiple providers. The city believes that nondiscriminatory access to the cable system for multiple providers of internet service may be a benefit to subscribers. Therefore, the city reserves the right to adopt requirements for such access to the cable system, subject to applicable law. Prior to such action, the city shall notify the grantee in writing at least 45 days in advance of its intent to impose such a requirement, and hold a hearing which affords the grantee and other interested members of the public the right to be heard. By approval and acceptance of this franchise, neither the city nor the grantee has waived any rights, obligations, claims, defenses or remedies regarding the city's authority to impose such conditions. 
SECTION 14. - PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENT ACCESS 
    § 14.01. Initial channels. As of the effective date of this franchise, [the] grantee shall dedicate two analog channels for the carriage of PEG programming. The grantee shall ensure that such PEG channels are of a technical quality comparable to any other channel offered over the cable system. 
    § 14.02. Additional channels. [The] grantee shall make available up to three additional analog PEG channels (for a total of five analog PEG channels) under the procedures below. If all the video programming services offered by [the] grantee on the cable system are in a digital format, [the] grantee shall make available additional digital PEG channels which will total no more than seven digital PEG channels (when added to the originally provided analog channels now offered in digital format). If the city or one of its PEG channel designees believes that additional channel capacity is needed for PEG programming, the interested party may file a request with the city. In its deliberations, the city will consider the ability and resources to produce additional PEG programming, the interest of the community in the additional PEG programming, consideration of [the] grantee-selected programming that may be displaced by the new PEG programming (if any), how much programming is produced on the existing PEG channels, how much programming on the existing PEG channels is repeated, how much programming on the existing PEG channels is character generated, whether it is feasible to cluster PEG programming into blocks of time such that the channel space can be compatibly shared between PEG programming providers and the grantee, and if several PEG programming providers should combine their programming onto a single PEG channel. Should the city find that the evidence exists to support the activation of an additional channel for PEG programming, then the city shall provide the decision in writing and [the] grantee shall provide the channel within 90 days of receiving the request. 
    § 14.03. Underutilized PEG channels. [The] grantee and the city agree that it is their mutual goal to fully and efficiently use the channel capacity of the cable system, which may include allowing the grantee to use underutilized time on the PEG channels. If [the] grantee believes that any PEG channel has underutilized time, [the] grantee may file a request with the city to use that time. In response to the request, the city will consider a combination of factors including, but not limited to, the community's needs and interests, and the source, quantity, type and schedule of the programming carried on the channel. The city will also consider, taking into account the mission of the PEG programming, whether it is feasible to cluster PEG programming into blocks of time such that the channel space can be compatibly shared between the PEG programming provider and the grantee and/or if several PEG programming providers can combine their programming onto a single PEG channel. The city shall render its decision regarding the matter within 90 days of receiving the request. Should the city find that the PEG channel or portion of the channel may be used by the grantee, then [the] grantee may begin using such time 90 days after receipt of the decision. The grantee's request shall not be unreasonably denied. Any permission granted pursuant to this subsection for use of a PEG channel or a portion thereof shall be considered temporary. At such time as a PEG programming provider believes that it has the resources and ability to utilize any PEG channel currently used by the grantee pursuant to this subsection, the PEG programming provider may request that the city return such PEG channel or portion of a PEG channel being used by the grantee to the PEG programming provider. In response to the request, the city will consider a combination of factors including, but not limited to, the community's needs and interests, the quantity and schedule of the programming the applicant proposes to carry on the PEG channel, and the applicant's ability and resources to acquire or produce the proposed PEG channel programming. The city will also consider whether it is feasible for the PEG programming provider to cluster programming into blocks of time such that the PEG channel can be compatibly shared between the PEG programming provider and the grantee and/or if several PEG programming providers can combine their programming onto a single PEG channel. The city shall render its decision regarding the matter within 90 days of receiving the request. Should the city find that the evidence exists to support the return of a PEG channel or portion of a PEG channel to the PEG programming provider, then the grantee shall surrender the requested time on the PEG channel within 90 days of receiving the decision. 
    § 14.04. Delivery of PEG programming. PEG programming can be in any format which is compatible with the technology utilized by the cable system, whether audio, video, or other information (including, by way of example and not limitation, secondary audio, text, digital information, high definition signals and compressed signals). Such uses must be in furtherance of PEG programming uses. [The] grantee may be required to deliver the PEG channels to subscribers in an analog format unless and until all other channels on the cable system are delivered in a digital format. 
    § 14.05. Management and control of PEG channels. The city or its designee shall have the right at its discretion to allocate and reallocate the PEG channels amongst public, educational and government access programming. The city may authorize a third party to control and manage the use of any or all PEG channels and related facilities provided by [the] grantee under this franchise. The city or its designee may formulate rules for the operation of PEG channels consistent with this franchise and federal law. 
    § 14.06. Return lines. Within 60 days of the effective date of this franchise, [the] grantee shall provide the necessary upstream channel capacity and equipment to originate PEG channel content from 4000 Main Street for dissemination over the cable system to subscribers, so long as such site is used to originate PEG programming. [The] grantee shall provide the necessary upstream channel capacity and equipment to route PEG channel content from additional sites as identified by the city within 120 days of said request, provided that the city is responsible for the direct costs of all construction and equipment. [The] grantee shall provide the city with an estimate of the construction and equipment costs prior to beginning construction of any new return line. [The] grantee shall not be responsible for constructing any new return line until the city has approved such costs in writing. 
    § 14.07. Relocation of access channels. [The] grantee will use reasonable efforts to minimize the movement of PEG channel assignments. [The] grantee shall provide the city with a minimum of 90 days' notice, and use its best efforts to provide 120 days' notice, prior to the time any PEG channel designation is changed, unless the change is required by federal law, in which case [the] grantee shall give the city the maximum notice possible. In addition, [the] grantee shall pay to the city an amount equal to the city's costs in remarketing the location of the PEG channels and managing the relocation administratively and technologically, up to a maximum of $0.50 per subscriber. [The] grantee shall only be allowed to recover such amounts paid to city as "external costs" (as that term is used in 47 CFR 76.922) if the movement of channels is required by federal, state or local law. [The] grantee, at [the] grantee's expense, will place the city's notices of the channel change on or with its regular monthly billings, upon the city's request. Any new channel designations for the PEG channels provided pursuant to this franchise shall be in full compliance with FCC signal quality and proof-of-performance standards. 
    § 14.08. PEG channels on basic cable service. All PEG access channels provided for under this section shall be part of basic cable service. 
    § 14.09. PEG capital support. 
A.  Within 60 days of the effective date of this franchise, [the] grantee shall provide the city with a grant of $75,000.00 for PEG capital purchases. 
B.  Any time after the first 12 months from the effective date of this franchise, the city may request up to $0.50 per subscriber per month as capital support for PEG programming, or as capital support for an I-Net provided pursuant to section 10.06 ("PEG capital fee"). The city shall give [the] grantee at least 90 days' advance written notice of [the] grantee's obligation to begin payment of the PEG capital fee, including the monthly amount to be collected. Each payment shall be due and payable no later than 30 days following the end of the quarter from when the PEG capital fee takes effect. The city shall have discretion to allocate the funds in accordance with applicable law. The city may adjust the amount of the PEG capital fee on an annual basis (up to the maximum amount specified in this paragraph), provided that [the] grantee is given 90 days' advance written notice. 
C.  [The] grantee shall pay a late charge in an amount which is the greater of $100.00 or ten percent per annum, compounded daily, on PEG capital fee payments, or portions thereof, that are paid subsequent to the payment dates specified above. 
    § 14.10. Technical assistance. Within one hour of a request from the city and/or its designee, identifying a problem and requesting assistance from the grantee regarding a PEG channel, [the] grantee will respond by telephone to address the problem. Within four hours of a request, [the] grantee shall provide technical assistance or diagnostic services to determine whether or not a problem with a PEG channel is the result of matters for which [the] grantee is responsible and, if so, [the] grantee will take prompt corrective action. Such assistance will be at no charge to the city. [The] grantee is responsible for the working condition of its facility to the point of demarcation. 
    § 14.11. Sponsorships. The city may obtain "PBS" type sponsorships and/or underwriting for PEG programming that it produces, provided that such support is not in conflict with the advertising sales of [the] grantee. 
SECTION 15. - EMERGENCY USE OF THE CABLE SYSTEM 
    § 15.01. Emergency or disaster. In accordance with and at the time required by the provisions of FCC Regulations Part 11, Subpart D, Section 11, and as such provisions may from time to time be amended, [the] grantee shall install and maintain an emergency alert system (EAS) for use in transmitting pursuant to such regulations in the event of an emergency. [The] grantee shall provide the city with the ability to activate the EAS from at least two locations in order to override both audio and video of all programming service simultaneously during a period of emergency or disaster. Such emergency alert capability shall be operational throughout the term of this franchise. [The] grantee shall provide the appropriate training to city personnel as may be necessary to operate the equipment and facilities necessary to satisfy this provision of the franchise. 
    § 15.02. Simultaneous EAS activation. In the event that the city enters into franchise agreements with other cable service providers, to the extent technically and legally feasible, [the] grantee shall cooperate with the city to create a system and/or procedure to simultaneously activate the EAS over all cable systems operating in the city. The cost of such interconnection shall be borne by the other cable operators connecting to the grantee's facilities. 
SECTION 16. - EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS 
    § 16.01. Equal opportunity in employment. [The] grantee shall afford equal opportunity in employment to all qualified persons. No person shall be discriminated against in employment because of race, color, religion, national origin, or gender. 
SECTION 17. - PAYMENT TO CITY 
    § 17.01. Amount and time. As compensation for the right, privilege, and franchise herein conferred, [the] grantee shall pay to city each year during the term of this franchise a sum equal to five percent of the grantee's gross revenue. Such payments shall be made quarterly within 30 days after the expiration of each calendar quarter. Accompanying the payment, [the] grantee shall file a financial statement prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles showing gross revenues by significant category used in the computation of said payment including, but not limited to, basic service, expanded basic service, pay TV, pay-per view, digital service, internet service, home shopping, advertising, and franchise fees. An officer or certified public accountant of the grantee shall sign such statement. 
    § 17.02. Annual financial report. [The] grantee shall file with the city within 60 days following the end of each calendar year, or portion thereof during which the franchise is in effect, an annual financial statement prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles showing gross revenues by significant category used in the computation of the franchise fee payment for the previous year. An officer or certified public accountant of the grantee shall sign such statement. 
    § 17.03. Right of inspection of records. The city shall have the right to inspect [the] grantee's or any affiliate's or cable operator's records showing the gross revenues from which payments to the city are computed and to audit and recompute any and all amounts paid under this franchise. The city's right to audit and the grantee's obligation to retain records related to a franchise fee audit shall expire [in] five years or as otherwise allowed by law after each franchise fee payment has been made to the city. The city shall have the right to hire, at its own expense, an independent certified public accountant, or other business or financial expert, to review the books and records of the grantee or any affiliate or cable operator in possession of pertinent information. If after a financial audit it is determined that the grantee has underpaid amounts owed to the city (in excess of two percent), then the city may require the grantee to reimburse the city for the actual cost of the audit. 
    § 17.04. Late payment charge. [The] grantee shall pay a late charge in an amount which is the greater of $100.00 or ten percent per annum, compounded daily, on franchise fee payments, or portions thereof, that are paid subsequent to the payment dates specified in § 17.01. In the event the city identifies, as a result of an audit, amounts owed by the grantee from prior periods, the grantee shall pay a late charge of eight percent per annum, compounded quarterly, on the amounts identified, calculated from the date each portion of the underpayment was originally due until the date [the] grantee remits the underpayment to the city. 
    § 17.05. Acceptance. Payments received from the grantee under this section shall not in any way limit or impair any of the privileges or rights of the city, whether under this franchise or otherwise. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is the correct amount, nor shall acceptance be construed as a release of any claim which the city may have for additional amounts payable under the provisions of this section, subject to the limitations in subsection 17.03. 
    § 17.06. Acts of noncollection. Any transaction or arrangement made for the purpose of evading franchise fees payable under this franchise is prohibited. 
    § 17.07. Additional commitments not franchise fees. The franchise fee payable hereunder shall be exclusive of and in addition to all ad valorem taxes, special assessments, fees for municipal improvements, the PEG capital fee and other lawful obligations of [the] grantee to city. Although the total sum of franchise fee payments and additional commitments set forth elsewhere in this franchise may total more than five percent of [the] grantee's gross revenues in any annual period, [the] grantee agrees that the additional commitments herein are neither franchise fees as defined under any federal law in effect as of the effective date of this franchise, nor are the additional payments to be offset or credited against any franchise fee payments due to the city, nor do they represent an increase in franchise fees to be passed through to subscribers. 
    § 17.08. Bundled services. If [the] grantee bundles, packages, or combines cable services (which are subject to the franchise fee under this franchise) with noncable services (which are not subject to the franchise fee under this franchise) and assesses a subscriber only one fee, [the] grantee shall provide the city with 30 days' advance notice of such bundling prior to the implementation of such billing processes. Such notice shall be subject to strict nondisclosure as provided by § 18.03 and include a detailed description of the bundled package or combination of services and the allocation methodology with respect to the allocation of revenue to each type of service offered. [The] grantee commits that it will not unlawfully or unfairly allocate revenue to the noncable services for the purpose of avoiding franchise fee payment under this franchise. The city shall have the right to audit all records related to the allocation of revenue to cable services and each of the noncable services. Nothing in this section shall limit the city's ability to perform such audit and any time during which bundled packages are offered to subscribers. Upon city's request, [the] grantee will meet with the city within five business days following advance notification to fully explain the methodology in which the bundling will occur and the allocation of the total revenue to cable services and each of the noncable services. If the city does not agree with [the] grantee's proposed allocation methodology, the city and [the] grantee may submit the matter to a mutually agreeable third party for mediation. The cost of the mediation shall be shared equally between the city and the grantee. In any event, either the city or the grantee can bring the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction, or pursue any other remedies available to them in this franchise or by law. During any period that the city and [the] grantee are in dispute concerning the bundling of services and resulting allocation methodology, the grantee agrees to maintain complete and accurate records of revenue received from the bundled services. Upon final determination by a third party or a court of competent jurisdiction concerning the allocation methodology, the grantee agrees that all franchise fees rendered pursuant this provision shall be computed in accordance with the applicable ruling. Any balance due to the city based on the recomputation of fees in accordance with the final determination of the allocation methodology shall include an additional ten percent per annum, compounded daily from the time period in which such fees would have been due and payable to the city if the final approved allocation methodology had been used during the period. Notwithstanding any interpretation to the contrary, this franchise does not authorize [the] grantee to vary or alter any payments or amounts of compensation to the city that may be dictated by another franchise, ordinance, agreement or by applicable law and are related to the use of the public rights-of-way in the provision of noncable services in the city.

    [The] grantee shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts and records of its business and operations under and in connection with this franchise and its exhibits. All such books of accounts and records related to enforcement of the franchise shall be made available for inspection by the city at a grantee office located within the Dallas metropolitan area during normal business hours upon advance notice. In the alternative and at [of the] grantee's discretion, [the] grantee may make books and records available in other locations, but must pay the travel costs for a city representative to visit this site if such review is requested by the city. [The] grantee shall maintain the books and records for franchise compliance purposes for a period of at least five years. If [the] grantee maintains books and records related to enforcement of the franchise for a period greater than five years, [the] city shall have access to those records. 
    § 18.03. Confidentiality. The city agrees to treat as confidential any books or records that constitute proprietary or confidential information under federal or state law, to the extent [the] grantee makes the city aware of such confidentiality. [The] grantee shall be responsible for clearly and conspicuously stamping the word "confidential" on each page that contains confidential or proprietary information, and shall provide a brief written explanation as to why such information is confidential under state or federal law. If the city believes it must release any such confidential books and records in the course of enforcing this franchise, or for any other reason, it shall advise [the] grantee in advance so that [the] grantee may take appropriate steps to protect its interests. If the city receives a demand from any person for disclosure of any information designated by [the] grantee as confidential, the city shall, so far as consistent with applicable law, advise [the] grantee and provide [the] grantee with a copy of any written request by the party demanding access to such information within a reasonable time. Until otherwise ordered by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction, the city agrees that, to the extent permitted by state and federal law, it shall deny access to any of [the] grantee's books and records marked confidential as set forth above to any person.

[The] grantee shall prepare such report for the most recent calendar quarter of information available, within 30 days of receiving a written request from the city. Such report will be requested no more often than quarterly, and shall be subject to subsection 18.03. 
SECTION 19. - REGULATION OF RATES 
    § 19.01. City regulation of [the] grantee's rates. The city council shall be empowered to regulate, by ordinance, the rates for any and all cable services, installations, and equipment of [the] grantee subject to regulation by the city, consistent with FCC rules governing rate regulation.

The city shall have access to all books and records related to [the] grantee's rates including bulk contract rate information, subject to applicable law. 
    § 19.02. Notice of rates. [The] grantee shall provide written notice of its then current rates and charges for any and all of its cable services in the city in compliance with any timing requirements prescribed in FCC regulations. 
SECTION 20. - FREE DROPS AND SERVICE 
    § 20.01. Free drops and service. [The] grantee shall, at no cost to the city, continue to provide one outlet of basic cable service and expanded basic cable service to all city owned and occupied buildings, schools and public libraries that exist as of the effective date of this franchise. For purposes of this subsection, [the term] "school" means all state accredited public and private K-12 schools. In addition, [the] grantee shall provide, at no cost to the city or other entity, one outlet of basic cable service and expanded basic cable service to new or relocated, owned or leased and occupied city buildings, schools and libraries where service is not being provided as of the effective date of this franchise upon request and if the drop line from the feeder cable to such building does not exceed 150 feet or if the city or other entity agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 feet, including the cost of such excess labor and materials within 90 days of the request. Such obligation to provide free cable service shall not extend to areas of city buildings where the grantee would normally enter into a commercial contract to provide such cable service (e.g., golf courses, airport restaurants and concourses, and recreation center work out facilities). Outlets of basic cable service and expanded basic cable service provided in accordance with this subsection may only be used to distribute cable services throughout such buildings upon the express agreement of the grantee. Any cable service provided under this subsection may only be used for lawful purposes.

This provision shall not be deemed to prohibit promotional campaigns to stimulate subscriptions to the cable system or other legitimate uses thereof. 
SECTION 22. - NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE 
    § 22.01. Franchise nonexclusive. The rights, privileges, and franchise granted hereby are not exclusive. This franchise shall not be construed as any limitation upon the right of the grantor, through its proper officers, to grant to other persons or corporations, including itself, rights, privileges or authority the same as, similar to or different from the rights, privileges or authority herein set forth, in the same or other streets and public ways by franchise, permit or otherwise. The city shall not authorize or permit any person providing video programming and/or cable services to enter into the public rights-of-way in any part of the city on terms or conditions more favorable or less burdensome to such person than those applied to the grantee pursuant to this franchise, in order that one operator not be granted an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal protection under the law. 
    § 22.02. Disputes. In the event that the city is considering the grant of a franchise to another person to provide video programming and/or cable services in the city, and the city provides a copy of the final negotiated franchise to [the] grantee, [the] grantee shall have 45 days to notify the city, in writing, of any alleged discrimination between this franchise and the burdens and rights provided in such other franchise. If the city does not provide a copy of the franchise to [the] grantee, [the] grantee shall have three months from the date [the] grantee receives a copy of the final negotiated franchise to notify the city, in writing, of any alleged discrimination between this franchise and the burdens and rights provided in such other franchise. In either event, failure to notify the city shall stop [the] grantee from any further action related to allegations of discrimination regarding the granting of such franchise.This subsection is not intended to prevent [the] grantee from any action related to the city's actual administration of such franchise that the grantee believes is discriminatory. 
SECTION 23. - BREACH OF FRANCHISE, NOTICE AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES 
    § 23.01. Notice of default; opportunity to cure; public hearing. 
A.  Notice of default. The city shall notify the grantee, in writing, of any alleged failure to comply with a provision of this franchise, which notice shall specify the alleged failure with reasonable particularity. The grantee shall have 30 days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to (i) correct the violation before the city may take further action (or with respect to any such violation, if by reason of the nature thereof such violation cannot with due diligence by wholly cured within such period of 30 days, then the 30-day period shall be extended for such period of time as may be necessary to complete the correction of the same with all due diligence, but in no event longer than 90 days unless a further extension of time is approved by the city council) or (ii) provide a written response to the city, presenting facts and arguments in refutation or excuse of such alleged failure. 
B.  If the city is unsatisfied with the grantee's response under § 23.01(A), the city shall hold a public hearing on the matter. [The] grantee must be given at least ten days' notice of the hearing. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to all the rights of due process consistent with the city procedures including, but not limited to, the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. The grantee shall make available to the city, if requested, any records, documents or other information reasonably necessary to its consideration of the matter. Following the public hearing, the city may determine (i) whether a failure to comply with a franchise provision has occurred; (ii) whether such failure is excusable; and (iii) whether such failure has been cured or will be cured by the grantee. After the hearing, [the] grantee will be provided with a written copy of any action taken by the city council, along with supporting documents. 
C.  If the city determines that a failure to comply with a provision of the franchise has occurred and that such failure is not excusable and has not been or will not be cured by the grantee in a manner and in accordance with a schedule reasonably satisfactory to the city, then the city may take any actions provided in § 23.02. 
D.  In the event of [the] grantee fails to make a franchise fee payment as required by subsection 11.01, fails to make the PEG payments specified in paragraphs 14.09A-C, or fails to maintain insurance in accordance with section 9, the city is not required to conduct the public hearing identified in paragraph B above, but may proceed directly to subsection 23.02 following the procedures in paragraph A above. 
    § 23.02. City action in event of breach. In the event that grounds exist which give the city reason to believe that the grantee failed to comply with a provision of this franchise, then the city may, at any time during the term of this franchise, to the extent lawful: (A) seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; (B) commence an action at law for monetary damages from the grantee as compensation for such breach; (C) seek liquidated damages pursuant to § 23.03; and/or (D) in the case of breach of a material provision of the franchise or other material violation as set forth in subsection 24.01 and 24.02, seek to revoke the franchise pursuant to subsection 24.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may not pursue monetary damages or liquidated damages for late payment of franchise fees in addition to the interest specified in subsection 17.04, or for late payment of the PEG capital fee in addition to the interest specified in paragraph 14.09 (C). 
    § 23.03. Liquidated damages. In the event the city's selected course of action following the process set forth in § 23.01 and § 23.02 is to impose liquidated damages, the city shall give [the] grantee written notice of its intent, and a reasonable period of time following receipt of the notice, not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days unless a longer period is approved by city council, to cure the alleged violation. If [the] grantee remains in violation of the franchise following this cure period, the city may charge to and collect from the grantee the liquidated damages set forth below, with the liquidated damages beginning to accrue no earlier than the day following the end of the cure period set forth above. The parties agree that actual damages that might be sustained by the city by reason of the breach by [the] grantee of the provisions of this franchise set forth below, are uncertain and difficult of ascertainment, and that the sums set forth below would be reasonable compensation for such breach, and [the] grantee promises to pay, and the city agrees to accept, such sums as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, in the event of such breach. Additionally such sums of money shall be considered liquidated damages due the city by [the] grantee by reason of inconvenience to the public and because of public works supervision and maintenance and other city administrative time and involvement which resulted in the expenditure of public funds due to [the] grantee's failure to comply with certain provisions in this franchise. [The] grantee covenants that any such sums paid to the city under this provision of the franchise shall not be included in the development of any rate, change, or price for services charged to subscribers. 
A.  For failure of [the] grantee to provide any report, certificate or map to the city as required by this franchise, $50.00 per day. 
B.  For failure of [the] grantee to provide services and upgrade in accordance with section 10, $1,000.00 per day. 
C.  For failure of [the] grantee to respond, restore or repair the public rights-of-way within 48 hours of notice by city under subsection 7.03, $250.00 per day for every day following 48 hours after [the] grantee's receipt of the notice. Should the city adopt any lawful and generally applicable ordinance governing the public rights-of-way which includes administrative fees for failure to restore the public rights-of-way, such fees in the ordinance shall apply to the grantee and supersede the ability of the city to collect liquidated damages under the franchise. 
D.  If city is required to relocate [the] grantee's facilities under subsection 7.04, [the] grantee shall pay $1,000.00 in addition to the costs incurred by the city in relocating the facilities. Should the city adopt any lawful and generally applicable ordinance governing the public rights-of-way which includes administrative fees for city-performed relocation of [the] grantee facilities, such fees in the ordinance shall apply to the grantee and supersede the ability of the city to collect liquidated damages under the franchise. 
E.  For failure of [the] grantee to provide the PEG channels as required by section 14, $100.00 per day. 
F.  For failure of [the] grantee to provide the city the ability to activate the EAS as required by subsection 15.01, $500.00 per day. 
G.  For failure of [the] grantee to provide the notice of rates as required by subsection 19.02, $50.00 per day. 
H.  For failure to comply with the service extension requirements set forth in section 27, the greater of $250.00 per day or $1.00 per day per impacted subscriber. 
I.  For failure to comply with any other provisions within the franchise, $100.00 per day, except for those provisions specifically identified in Exhibit A as having automatic liquidated damages for noncompliance and any other liquidated damages or fines that apply, subject to § 7.01. 
    § 23.04. Force majeure. Other than its failure, refusal, or inability to pay its debts and obligations, including, specifically, the payments to city required by this franchise, [the] grantee shall not be declared in default or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this franchise in those cases in which performance of such provision is prevented by reasons beyond its control. 
    § 23.05. Reservation of rights. The rights reserved to the city under this section are in addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by this franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right shall affect any other right the city may have. 
    § 23.06. Reimbursement of legal fees. In the event the city must seek a legal remedy pursuant to this section, [the] grantee shall pay the reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred by the city related to the action. Additionally, venue and jurisdiction for any action for breach or default of this agreement will lie in Dallas County, Texas. 
SECTION 24. - REVOCATION OF FRANCHISE 
    § 24.01. General. In addition to all rights and powers of the city by virtue of this franchise or otherwise, the city reserves, as an additional and as a separate and distinct power, the right to revoke the franchise in accordance with the procedures specified herein if any of the following events occur or for any of the following reasons:

F.  [The] grantee becomes insolvent or is adjudged bankrupt or all or any part of [the] grantee's facilities are sold under an instrument to secure a debt and are not redeemed by [the] grantee within 30 days from the date of such sale; provided, however, this shall not be an event of termination or cancellation in the event of bankruptcy proceeding and the trustee, receiver, or debtor in possession agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this franchise. 
G.  [The] grantee has been found by a court of law to have practiced any fraud or deceit in its conduct or relations under this franchise with the city, subscribers or potential subscribers.

Should the city council determine, following the process set forth in § 23.01 and § 23.02 (to the extent applicable) that its selected course of action shall be to seek revocation of the franchise, the city shall give [the] grantee written notice of such intent. The notice shall set forth the causes and reasons for the proposed revocation, shall advise [the] grantee that it will be provided an opportunity to be heard by city regarding such proposed action before any such action is taken, and shall set forth the time, date, and place of the hearing. In no event shall such hearing be held less than 30 days following delivery of such notice to [the] grantee. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to all rights of due process consistent with the city procedures including, but not limited to, the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. Any such revocation of this franchise shall be by ordinance. 
    § 24.04. [The] grantee may appeal city's decision.

Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within 60 days of the issuance of the determination of the city. 
SECTION 25. - ASSIGNMENT OF FRANCHISE 
    § 25.01. City approval of assignment required. This franchise shall be a privilege personal to the grantee and shall not be assigned or transferred, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an affiliate of comparable or better technical and financial capabilities, in whole or in part, without the prior consent of the city expressed by resolution or ordinance, and then only under such conditions as may be lawfully prescribed therein. Within 30 days of receiving the request for transfer, the city shall notify the grantee in writing of the information it requires to determine the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee. If the city has not taken action on the grantee's request for transfer within 120 days after receiving such request and provided the city has promptly received from [the] grantee the information it requested in connection with the request, consent by the city shall be deemed given. No assignment to any person shall be effective until the transferee has filed with the city an instrument in writing, duly executed, reciting the fact of such assignment, accepting the terms of this franchise, and agreeing to comply with all of the provisions hereof, subject to applicable law. 
    § 25.02. City approval of transfer of control required. The grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or disposition or acquisition by any other person in control of the grantee. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto by resolution or ordinance provided that the city has acted within the time constraints required by law. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, disposition, or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the prospective controlling party, but shall do so within 30 days of receipt of the requested transfer from the grantee. [The] grantee shall assist the city in such inquiry and will respond within ten days unless a longer time is reasonably necessary to respond or allowed by law. 
SECTION 26. - FAILURE OF CITY TO ENFORCE FRANCHISE 
    § 26.01. No waiver of terms. The grantee shall not be excused from complying with each and all of the terms, conditions, and provisions of this franchise even though the city should upon one or more occasions fail to insist upon, to require, or to seek compliance with any such term, condition, or provision. 
SECTION 27. - SERVICE AVAILABILITY 
    § 27.01. Service availability. The grantee shall provide cable service throughout the entire franchise area, subject to the provision below. 
    § 27.02. Annexations. If the city annexes any contiguous area which is being provided cable service by the grantee or its affiliates, the annexed area will be subject to the provisions of this franchise upon the effective date of the annexation; provided, however, that [the] grantee shall be allowed a reasonable time under the circumstances to make any required modifications to the cable system, cable services, billing system, etc., as may be required to accommodate such change, and provided that if the area is serviced by an affiliate, a transfer of ownership of the cable system in that area to the grantee shall not be required by the city. If the annexed area is being provided cable service by another provider, [the] grantee shall have the right, but not the requirement, to extend its cable system to the annexed area. If the annexed area is not being provided cable services, the grantee shall be required to provide service within one year of the annexation. 
    § 27.03. Extension policy. [The] grantee must extend and make cable service available to every lot or tract of land for which the owner or occupant thereof has requested service in all unserved areas having at least ten dwelling units constructed or planned for construction per 1,320 cable bearing strand feet or 25 dwelling units per cable bearing strand mile, as measured from the portion of the existing system to be extended. Extensions shall be at [the] grantee's cost. The city understands that the grantee retains all rights to negotiate payment of such extensions or portion thereof by a third party. If more than 125 feet of distance lies between the nearest distribution cable and the point of connection of service to the property for which service is requested, the grantee may charge the potential subscriber nonstandard installation charges as allowed by federal law. Should such potential subscriber be located beyond the 125 feet, [the] grantee must install the first 125 feet at [the] grantee's sole expense and cost. If the unserved area is a new underground development, [the] grantee shall participate in joint trenching with the other utilities installing service to the area, provided that the grantee is provided adequate notice and access to the trenches. The ability of the grantee to participate in joint trenching shall not impact the grantee's requirement to provide extensions pursuant to this subsection. 
    § 27.04. Contributions in aid of construction. In the event that potential subscribers request cable service in an area that does not meet the density requirements of subsection 27.03, the subscriber(s) will be given the alternative to provide a contribution in aid of construction of the cable system extension equal to 75 percent of the grantee's actual out-of-pocket costs to provide extensions less than 1,320 cable bearing strand feet. That portion of any extension greater than 1,320 cable bearing feet shall be paid by the subscriber(s) at the grantee's actual out-of-pocket cost. In the event that any portion of the extension for which a subscriber has provided contribution in aid of construction ultimately meets the extension requirements in subsection 27.03, [the] grantee shall reimburse all subscribers that have made such contributions in aid of construction, provided that such subscribers provide evidence of having made such contributions to [the] grantee. 
SECTION 28. - VALUATION 
    § 28.01. Purchase price of cable system. If the franchise is revoked for cause and the parties agree that the city may purchase the cable system, the city may purchase the cable system at an equitable price. If renewal of the franchise is lawfully denied and the parties agree that the city may purchase the cable system, the city may purchase the cable system at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. Should the parties fail to agree upon the equitable price or the fair market value of the cable system, the same shall be determined in an appropriate proceeding filed in any court having jurisdiction. 
SECTION 29. - RECOURSE, UNDERSTANDING, CONSTRUCTION, AND SEVERABILITY 
    § 29.01. Requirements and enforcement. Except as expressly provided herein, [the] grantee shall have no monetary recourse whatsoever against city of any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of the provisions or requirements of this franchise or because of the enforcement thereof by [the] city or because of the lack of [the] city's authority to grant all or any part of this franchise. 
    § 29.02. [The] grantee's understanding. [The] grantee expressly acknowledges that in accepting this franchise, it relied solely upon its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of city to grant this franchise and that [the] grantee was not induced to accept this franchise by any understanding, promise, or other statement, verbal or written, by or on behalf of [the] city or by any third person concerning any term or condition not expressed herein. 
    § 29.03. Construction of franchise. By acceptance of this franchise, [the] grantee acknowledges that it has carefully read the provisions hereof and is willing to and does accept all of the risks of the meanings of such provisions. 
    § 29.04. Provisions severable. If any provision, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this franchise is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this franchise. It is the intent of [the] city in adopting this franchise that no portion or provision thereof shall become inoperative or fail by reason of any invalidity or unconstitutionality of any other portion or provision, and to this end all provisions of this franchise are declared to be severable. 
SECTION 30. - ACCEPTANCE OF FRANCHISE 
    § 30.01. Method of acceptance. Within 30 days from the effective date of this franchise, [the] grantee shall file with the city secretary a written statement in the following form signed in its name and behalf: "To the Honorable Mayor and City Council of the City of Rowlett, Texas: For itself, its successors, and assigns, TCI TKR of the Metroplex, Inc., duly authorized to do business in the State of Texas, hereby accepts the attached franchise and agrees to be bound by all of its terms, conditions, and provisions, subject to applicable law." 
EXHIBIT A: - CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS 
These standards shall apply to the grantee and any affiliates of [the] grantee to the extent they are providing cable services over the cable system. 

Section 1. - Definitions. 
A.  Outage. A service interruption affecting multiple subscribers in a contiguous area that has the same source problem 
B.  Service call. The action taken by the grantee to correct a service interruption affecting an individual subscriber. 
C.  Service interruption. The loss of picture or sound on one or more channels. 
D.  Standard installation. Installations where the length of the drop is up to 125 feet. 
Section 2. - Telephone availability. 
A.  The grantee shall maintain a toll-free number to respond to all calls and inquiries from subscribers in the franchise area and/or city residents regarding cable service. [The] grantee representatives, trained and qualified to answer questions related to cable service in the franchise area, must be available to receive requests for service calls or report outages 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and other inquiries at least 45 hours per week, including some evening and weekend hours. [The] grantee representatives shall identify themselves by name when answering this number. 
B.  The grantee's telephone numbers shall be listed, with appropriate description (e.g., administration, customer service, billing, repair, etc.), in the directory published by the local telephone company or companies serving the franchise area. 
C.  In the event that the grantee chooses to use an automated response unit ("ARU") or a voice response unit ("VRU") to distribute calls, the system shall have as a first tier menu option (not including a routing option for foreign language), an option "for all other inquiries." If a foreign language routing option is provided, and the subscriber does not enter an option, the menu will default to the first tier menu of English options. After the first tier menu (not including a foreign language routing option) has run through twice, if customers do not select any option, the ARU or VRU will forward the call to a queue for a live representative. The grantee may reasonably substitute this requirement with another method of handling calls from customers who do not have touch-tone telephones. The total elapsed time between when a subscriber's call is first answered by an ARU or VRU to the end of the last tier menu shall not be longer than 90 seconds. For purposes of this subsection, the "last tier menu" is the last tier before the subscriber is routed to a live representative, or specific information is given to the subscriber, such as instructions for troubleshooting or directions to an office. The city may review the options provided to callers and recommend to the grantee that additional options be provided. The grantee shall consider the city's recommendations. 
D.  Under normal operating conditions, calls received by the grantee shall be answered within 30 seconds after the subscriber has selected their final menu option. The grantee shall meet this standard for 90 percent of the calls it receives, as measured on a calendar quarter basis. Measurement of this standard shall include all calls received by the grantee, whether they are answered by a live representative, automated attendant, or abandoned before completion. 
    If the grantee does not meet the 90 percent standard described in this paragraph D during any calendar quarter, liquidated damages may be assessed by the city against the grantee as follows: 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 85 percent and less than 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the city $100.00. 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 75 percent and less than 85 percent, the grantee shall pay the city $300.00.

A.  All installations will be in accordance with FCC rules, including but not limited to, appropriate grounding, connection of equipment to ensure reception of cable service, and the provision of required consumer information and literature to adequately inform the subscriber in the utilization of the grantee-supplied equipment and cable services. 
B.  Under normal operating conditions, standard installations shall be performed within seven days after an order has been placed, except when a subscriber has specifically requested an installation date later than seven days after order placement. The company shall meet this standard for 90 percent of the standard installations it performs, as measured on a calendar quarter basis, excepting out customer requests for connection later than seven days after order placement. If the grantee does not meet the 90 percent standard described in this paragraph B during any calendar quarter, liquidated damages may be assessed by the city against the grantee as follows: 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 85 percent and less than 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the city $100.00.

The grantee may offer to schedule subscriber appointments for a specific time and shall schedule the subscriber to be the first call of the day or last call of the day if requested by the subscriber and warranted by the circumstances. The grantee shall also perform some service calls outside of the hours specified above in the evenings and on weekends. 
E.  At the request of the subscriber, the grantee will call the subscriber prior to an installation or service call appointment. The call shall be made by the grantee at the approximate time and to the telephone number requested by the subscriber. 
F.  At the time this franchise was entered into, [the] grantee was voluntarily participating in the industry "on-time guarantee" program. Under the terms of that program, if the grantee does not arrive for an installation or service call appointment within the scheduled time frame agreed to with the subscriber, the subscriber is entitled to receive either a free standard installation in the event of an installation appointment, or a $20.00 credit in the event of a missed service call appointment. Calling a subscriber during the appointment window does not negate the subscriber's entitlement to credit for a missed appointment. The grantee will participate in this program and reserves the right to substitute another customer service program for the "on-time guarantee" at its discretion, provided that the subscriber benefits are reasonably comparable to those provided by the current program. 
G.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee may not cancel an appointment with a subscriber after 6:00 p.m. on the business day prior to the day of the scheduled appointment. 
H.  If the grantee's representative is running late for an appointment with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the grantee will document an effort to contact the subscriber directly.

The appointment will be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is mutually agreeable. 
I.  If it is necessary to place a temporary drop on the ground, the grantee shall bury the temporary drop within ten business days, under normal operating conditions. The ten-day period shall be extended for days that the grantee is unable to bury the drop due to unfavorable weather conditions. 
Section 5. - Service interruptions and outages. 
A.  The grantee shall make repairs promptly, and interrupt cable service only as necessary and for the shortest time period possible.

B.  The grantee shall promptly notify the city of any significant outage of the cable system. For the purposes of this section, a significant outage of the cable system shall mean any service interruption lasting at least four continuous hours that affects at least ten percent of the subscribers in the franchise area. 
C.  The grantee shall exercise its best efforts to limit any outage for the purpose of maintaining, repairing, or constructing the cable system. Except in an emergency or other situation necessitating a more expedited or alternative notification procedure, the grantee may schedule an outage for a period of more than four hours during any 24-hour period only after the city and each affected subscriber in the city have been given 15 days prior notice of the proposed outage. 
D.  Technicians employed by the grantee who are capable of responding to outages must be available to respond 24 hours a day, seven days per week. 
E.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee must respond to a call or written notice from a subscriber regarding a service interruption within 24 hours. The grantee must begin actions to correct all other cable service problems the next business day after notification by the subscriber or the city of a cable service problem. 
F.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall complete service calls within 72 hours after being notified of a service interruption, not including situations where the subscriber is not reasonably available for a service call to correct the service interruption within the 72-hour period. 
G.  The grantee shall meet the standard in paragraph F of this section for 90 percent of the service calls it completes, as measured on a quarterly basis. If the grantee fails to meet this standard during any calendar quarter, liquidated damages may be assessed by the city against the grantee as follows: 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 85 percent and less than 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the city $100.00. 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 75 percent and less than 85 percent, the grantee shall pay the city $300.00. 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs equal to or greater than 65 percent and less than 75 percent, the grantee shall pay the city $1,000.00. 
 Any quarter where the grantee performs less than 65 percent, the grantee shall pay the city $2,000.00. 
For any consecutive quarter(s) in which the grantee performs at a level below 90 percent, the grantee shall pay the city the amount listed above for the most recent quarter, plus the amount paid to the city for the previous quarter. For example, if the grantee performs at 79 percent one quarter and 60 percent in the next quarter, the grantee shall pay the city $300.00 for the first quarter and $2,300.00 [$2,000.00 for the most recent quarter plus $300.00 for the previous quarter] for the second quarter. If [the] grantee continues to have a 60 percent performance in the third quarter, the payment shall be $4,300.00 [$2,000.00 for the most recent quarter and $2,300.00 for the pervious quarter.] 
H.  The grantee shall provide the city with a report within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter, noting the following:

I.  At the grantee's option, the measurements and reporting above may be changed from calendar quarters to billing or accounting quarters. The grantee shall notify the city of such a change at least 30 days in advance. 
J.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall provide credit upon subscriber request to affected subscriber(s) when all channels received by that subscriber are out for a period of four consecutive hours or more.

In order to qualify for the credit, the subscriber must promptly report the problem and allow the grantee to verify the problem if requested by the grantee. 
K.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall provide a credit upon subscriber request to any subscriber experiencing a service interruption of any channel(s) for a period of four consecutive hours or more. The credit shall equal, at a minimum, a proportionate amount of the affected cable service.

L.  Under normal operating conditions, if an outage affects all video programming cable services in an area which serves more than ten percent of total grantee subscribers in the franchise area, for more than 24 consecutive hours, the grantee shall issue an automatic credit to the affected subscribers in the amount of the value of basic plus expanded basic service for the proportionate time the cable service was out. Such credit will be reflected on subscriber billing statements within 45 days following the outage. Such credit under this provision does not negate the subscriber's right to request additional credit under items I and J herein. 
M.

Such log shall be kept at the grantee's office in or near the franchise area, for a period of at least three years and shall be available for inspection during regular business hours by city upon request, subject to section 631 of the Cable Act regarding subscriber privacy. Additionally, the grantee shall maintain a written or electronic log of every subscriber complaint referred by the city, including the dates, times and detailed information related to the complaint and resolution. The grantee shall cooperate with the city in the development of this log format. If the city receives a pattern of complaints from subscribers which indicates a recurring problem, city may require the grantee to maintain a manual or electronic log of the problem being tracked until such time as the calls to the city are reasonably reduced. 
B.  Under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall resolve subscriber complaints referred by the city within 72 hours. The grantee shall notify the city of those matters that necessitate an excess of 72 hours to resolve, but those matters must be finally resolved within ten days of the initial complaint. The city may require reasonable documentation to be provided by the grantee to substantiate the request for additional time to resolve the problem If the grantee fails to resolve a complaint within the required 72 hours (or extended period), the grantee shall pay to the city $100.00 per day for each day the complaint is not resolved within the specified time frame. For purposes of this subsection, [the term] "resolve" means that the grantee shall perform those actions which, in the normal course of business, are necessary to respond to the subscriber's problem. 
Section 7. - Billing. 
A.  Subscriber bills must be itemized, in accordance with cable services purchased by subscribers and related equipment charges. Bills shall clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates, credits, and late charges.If the grantee chooses to itemize franchise fees and/or other governmentally imposed fees as a separate line item(s), such fees must be shown in accordance with applicable law.

B.  Every subscriber with a current account balance sending payment directly to [the] grantee shall be given at least 20 days from the date statements are mailed to the subscriber until the payment due date.

To the extent that the grantee chooses to bill in advance for cable services, every subscriber with a current account balance sending payment directly to the grantee shall be given at least 15 days from the first day of the billing period until the payment due date. The billing period is the time period for which cable services are being billed. For example if the customer's billing period is from the first to the 31st of the month, the due date shall not be earlier than the 15th day of the month. 
D.  A specific due date shall be listed on the bill of every subscriber whose account is current. Delinquent accounts may receive a bill which lists the due date as "upon receipt"; however, the current portion of that bill shall not be considered past due except in accordance with B and C above. 
E.  Any subscriber who, in good faith, disputes all or part of any bill shall have the option of withholding the disputed amount without disconnect or late fee being assessed until the dispute is resolved, provided that: 
 The subscriber pays all undisputed charges; 
 The subscriber provides notification of the dispute to [the] grantee within five days of the due date; and 
 The subscriber cooperates in determining the accuracy and/or appropriateness of the charges in dispute.

    The city recognizes that only option (4) above is available as of the effective date of this franchise for subscription to the grantee's cable Internet service, but that the grantee is taking steps to make options (1) - (3) available in the near future. The city reserves the right to enforce the requirement above for the cable internet service if the grantee has not voluntarily made available the other payment options within 18 months of the effective date of this franchise. 
Section 8. - Deposits, refunds and credits. 
A.  The grantee may require refundable deposits from subscribers with 1) a poor credit or poor payment history, 2) who refuse to provide credit history information to the grantee, or 3) who rent subscriber equipment from the grantee, so long as such deposits are applied on a nondiscriminatory basis. The maximum deposit the grantee may charge subscribers with poor credit or poor payment history or who refuse to provide credit information is the average of a typical subscriber's bill over the most recent six-month period. The maximum deposit the grantee may charge for subscriber equipment is the cost (not depreciated value) of the equipment which the grantee would need to purchase to replace the equipment rented to the subscriber. 
B.

In the event that cable service is terminated pursuant to a bulk contract and the grantee is permitted to enter into cable service arrangements with individual dwellings previously serviced under such contract, the grantee shall not hold such individual subscriber(s) liable for any nonpayment or underpayments related specifically to the contract. Subscribers may be held accountable for payment for cable services subscribed to during the period of the contract, which were in addition to the cable services provided pursuant to the contract. 
C.  Cable service terminated in error must be restored without charge within 24 hours of notice. If subscriber was billed for the period during which cable service was terminated in error, an automatic credit shall be issued to subscriber if the service interruption was reported by the subscriber.

E.  No period of notice prior to requested termination of service can be required of subscribers by the grantee. No charge shall be imposed upon the subscriber for or related to total disconnection of cable service, or for any cable service delivered after the effective date of the disconnect request (unless there is a delay in returning grantee equipment). If the subscriber fails to specify an effective date for disconnection, the subscriber shall not be responsible for cable service received after the day following the date the disconnect request is received by the grantee.

Sec. 2. - Construction, maintenance, operation and relocation of company facilities. 
2.01.  Company shall lay, maintain, construct, operate, use, extend, remove, repair, and replace its pipes, mains, laterals, and other equipment to minimize interference with the proper and intended use of the public rights-of-way and with the rights of the owners or occupants of property which adjoin any of such public rights-of-way. The location of all company's pipes, mains, laterals, and other equipment in the present and future public rights-of-way in the city shall be fixed under the supervision of the city or an authorized agent appointed by the city. Company agrees to apply for and receive public rights-of-way permits from the city, as required, prior to company activity in the public rights-of-way. Company agrees to comply with all other city laws, rules, or ordinances that govern the use of public rights-of-way that currently exist or may be applicable during the term of this franchise in accordance with section 13.02. 
2.02.  The surface of any public rights-of-way disturbed by the company in laying, maintaining, constructing, operating and replacing shall be restored to approximate original condition as soon as is reasonably possible, but in no instance more than 30 days after the completion of the work, and the restoration shall be maintained by company to the satisfaction of the city for one year from the date of completion of such restoration work. The 30 day period shall be extended for days that the company is unable to perform the work due to unfavorable weather conditions. In the event restoration is scheduled to take longer than 30 days for any other reason, company shall provide the city with written notice as to the reasons for the delay. If there is an unreasonable delay by company in restoring and maintaining public rights-of-way after such excavations or repairs have been made, city shall have the right, following written notice to company to which company has 48 hours in which to respond, to restore or repair the same and to require company to pay to the city the reasonable cost of such restoration or repair, all without compensation or liability for damages to the company. In the event city determines that company's use of any of city's public rights-of-way as set forth in this franchise pose an immediate danger to the health, safety or general welfare of the public, city shall have the right to restore or repair same and shall require company to pay to the city the reasonable costs incurred regarding same, all without compensation or liability for damages to the company, unless such damage was caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of the city or its agents. 
2.03.  When company makes, or causes to be made, excavations, or places, or causes to be placed, obstructions in any public rights-of-way, company shall place, erect, and maintain barriers and lights to identify the location of such excavations or obstructions. Company will provide the city written notice within 15 days of any proposed excavation, or in the event of emergency, written notice immediately after such emergency excavation. In determining the location of company's pipeline within city, company shall minimize interference with then existing underground structures of city or other utility franchisees. In the event of a conflict between the location of the facilities of company and the location of the facilities of city or other utility franchisees within public rights-of-way that cannot otherwise be resolved, city or an authorized agent of city shall resolve the conflict and determine the location of the respective facilities. 
2.04.  When the company is required by city to remove, modify, alter or relocate its mains, laterals, and other facilities to accommodate construction, relocation, widening, raising or lowering of grade of any public rights-of-way by city, such removal, modification, alteration, or relocation shall be promptly made by company when directed in writing to do so by the city, company shall pay the cost of such relocation unless there are funds generally available to affected users of the public rights-of-way for reimbursement of such costs, in which case company shall be entitled to its share of such funding. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the city shall make application for such funds on behalf of the company upon request of company if company cannot make such application itself. If such reimbursement is required to be handled through city, company costs and expenses shall be included in any application by city for reimbursement, if company submits its cost and expense documentation to city prior to the filing of the application city shall provide reasonable notice to company of the deadline for company to submit documentation of the costs and expenses of such relocation to city, company shall have the right to seek a surcharge to recover relocation costs pursuant to section 104.112 et al, of the Texas Utilities Code. In the event company, after notice, fails or refuses to commence, pursue, or complete such relocation work within a reasonable time, the city may require and the company will attend a meeting that establishes a formal record of the reasons for the delay and the timeframe in which the company will complete the relocation work. If the city experiences additional out-of-pocket costs as a result of the delay, the city may file a claim with the company in accordance with section 12. 
2.05.  The city recognizes that the if [sic] city abandons or sells any public right-of-way in which company has facilities, the city agrees to consider any request from the company that such abandonment or sale be conditioned on company's right to maintain its use of the former public right-of-way and that it be the obligation of the party to whom the public right-of-way is abandoned or sold to reimburse company for all removal or relocation expenses, including the expense of any right-of-way acquisition resulting from the relocation. 
2.06.  Company shall provide complete plans and specifications for all construction within public rights-of-way to the city. Approval of plans and specifications shall not be unreasonably delayed or denied. In the event of rejection, company shall submit revised plans and specifications for approval. This provision shall apply to each construction sequence if the construction is accomplished in phases.

However, in the event of an emergency, the company shall respond as soon as possible as provided in section 2.02. In the event that company fails to provide the necessary information, and damage is caused to company facilities as a direct result of withholding such information, the company shall hold the city harmless from all liability, damage, cost or expense resulting from any city action. Not withstanding the provisions contained in this section, the city shall be responsible for adequately securing any excavation or access site and shall be responsible for any negligence or willful misconduct by its agents or employees in this regard. 
2.08.

At a minimum, this requires the company to provide the city with access to its information concerning the location of all facilities within the public rights-of-way. 
2.09.  In addition to providing the location of company's facilities, company agrees to obtain facilities location information from other users of the public rights-of-way prior to company's construction, reconstruction, maintenance, operations and repair of its facilities.

4.01.  Company shall be entitled to require from each and every customer of gas, before gas service is commenced or reinstated, a deposit in an amount calculated pursuant to the company's quality of service rules as may be in effect during the term of this franchise. Such deposit shall be retained and refunded in accordance with such quality of service rules and shall bear interest, as provided in V.T.C.A., Utilities Code ch. 183 as it may be amended from time to time. Company shall be entitled to apply such deposit, with accrued interest, to any indebtedness owed company by the customer making the deposit. 
4.02.  In addition to the rates charged for gas supplied, company may make and enforce reasonable charges, rules and regulations for service rendered in the conduct of its business, including a charge for services rendered in the inauguration of natural gas service.

Additionally, this franchise only authorizes the company to provide the distribution of natural gas to the end-user within the city or the transport of natural gas to the end-user within the city that is conducted by TXU Gas Distribution. 
Sec. 6. - Nonexclusive franchise. 
    The rights, privileges, and franchises granted by this ordinance are not to be considered exclusive, and city hereby expressly reserves the right to grant, at any time, like privileges, rights, and franchises as it may see fit to any other person or corporation for the purpose of transporting, delivering, distributing, or selling gas to and for city and the inhabitants thereof. 
Sec. 7. - Payments to city. 
7.01.  Company, its successors and assigns, agrees to pay and city agrees to accept, on or before February 15, 2003, and on or before the same day of each succeeding year during the life of this franchise the last payment being made on February 15, 2017, a sum of money which shall be equivalent to four percent of the gross revenues received by company from the sale and transportation of gas to its residential, commercial, and industrial customers within the corporate limits of such city (expressly excluding revenues from governmental accounts in such city) during the preceding calendar year, which annual payments shall be for the rights and privileges herein granted to company, including expressly, the right to use the public rights-of-way of city. For purposes of determining the gross revenue received from transportation of gas through company lines, the company shall include not only the fees received from the transportation customers, but also the actual cost of the gas transported. Each transportation customer shall disclose to the company the purchase price of such gas. Should the transportation customer fail or refuse to disclose or furnish such purchase price to the company, company shall establish same by utilizing 100 percent of the Houston Ship Channel index of prices for large packages of gas published each month in Inside FERC's Gas Market Report (or a successor publication or another publication agreed upon by the city and company) for the period of time the transportation service is performed. Company shall use all due diligence in collecting from transportation customers and any and all fees required by this franchise agreement. It is expressly agreed that gross revenues exclude 
(1)  Taxes imposed by law on customers that the company is obligated to collect and which the company passes on, in full, to the applicable tax authority or authorities; 
(2)  Any investment income earned by the company; and 
(3)  Uncollected accounts. 
7.02.  The initial payment for the rights and privileges herein provided shall be for the period January 1 through December 31, 2003. Each succeeding payment shall be for the calendar year in which the payment is made with the final payment on or before February 15, 2017. And it is also expressly agreed that the aforesaid payments shall be in lieu of any and all other and additional occupation taxes, franchise taxes (whether levied as an ad valorem, special, or other character of tax or charge), municipal license, permit, and inspection fees, street taxes, and street or alley rentals or charges, excepting only the usual general or special ad valorem taxes which city is authorized to levy and impose upon real and personal property. City retains the right to file a claim with the company in accordance with section 12 in those instances where any of the above initial fees have been waived as being included in the franchise fee, but the city has experienced extraordinary costs due to company operations. 
7.03.  Company agrees that on the same date that payments are made, as provided in this section 7, it will file with the city secretary a report showing the gross revenues received by the company from the sale and transportation of gas to its residential, commercial, and industrial customers within city during the year preceding the date of payment. City may, if it sees fit, have the books and records of company examined by a representative of city to ascertain the correctness of the reports agreed to be filed herein. Such books and records shall be made available by the company at 1601 Bryan Street, Dallas, Texas 75201. In the event the city reasonably and lawfully identifies, as a result of an audit, amounts owed by the company from a prior period in question, the company shall pay interest on the reasonably and lawfully identified delinquent amounts equal to a rate equivalent to what the city would have earned on such amounts had it been available for the city's investment purposes. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable under this franchise or for the performance of any other obligation hereunder. 
7.04.  For franchise fee payments, or portions thereof, that are delinquent and paid subsequent to the payment dates specified in this section, company also agrees to include interest on the delinquent amount equal to a rate equivalent to what the city would have earned on such amounts had it been available for the city's investment purposes. 
Sec. 8. - Bonding requirements. 
    In the event that the city has determined that the company has not appropriately responded to construction, maintenance, and/or repair issues raised by the city, the city may require a construction bond in an amount related to the construction, maintenance and/or repair issue. The rights reserved by the city with respect to a construction bond are in addition to all other rights the city may have under the franchise or any other law. The bond shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled without the consent of the city. The city must be given 30 days written notice by registered mail, return receipt requested, of intent to cancel or not to renew." 
Sec. 9. - Acceptance of franchise. 
9.01.  In order to accept this franchise, company must file with the city secretary its written acceptance of this franchise ordinance within 60 days after its final passage and approval by city. If such written acceptance of this franchise ordinance is not filed by company, the franchise ordinance shall be rendered null and void. 
9.02.  When this franchise ordinance becomes effective, all previous ordinances of city granting franchises for gas delivery purposes that were held by company shall be automatically canceled and annulled, with the exception of any discrepancies noted with respect to the payment of fees; and/or any damages arising from company actions and/or inaction for the period prior [to] January 1, 2002 through and inclusive of August 31, 2002. 
Sec. 10. - Notices. 
    Any notices required or desired to be given from one party to the other party to this ordinance shall be in writing and shall be given and shall be deemed to have been served and received (whether actually received or not) if (i) delivered in person to the address set forth below; (ii) deposited in an official depository under the regular care and custody of the United States Postal Service located within the confines of the United States of America and sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and addressed to such party at the address hereinafter specified; or (iii) delivered to such party by courier receipted delivery.

This Franchise shall be a privilege personal to the company and shall not be assigned or transferred, or otherwise encumbered, in whole or in part, other than to an affiliate of comparable or better technical and financial capabilities, without the prior consent of the city expressed by resolution or ordinance. No assignment to any person shall be effective until the transferee has filed with the city an instrument in writing, duly executed, reciting the fact of such assignment, accepting the terms of this franchise, and agreeing to comply with all of the provisions hereof. 
11.02.  Company shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or disposition or acquisition by any other person in control of the company. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the company shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto by resolution or ordinance. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
Sec. 12. - Default and forfeiture. 
12.01.  In the event the company has failed or refused to correct a defect, impairment or substandard condition after written notice by the city and such failure has continued for longer than 45 days from the date the notice was received by the company, the city shall have the right to file a claim through the company's claims department. 
12.02.  The city shall notify the company, in writing, of an alleged failure to comply with a provision of this ordinance, which notice shall specify the alleged failure with reasonable particularity. The company shall, within 30 days after receipt of such notice or such longer period of time as the city may specify in such notice, either cure such alleged failure or, in a written response to the city, either present facts and arguments in refutation or excuse of such alleged failure or state that such alleged failure will be cured and set forth the method and time schedule for accomplishing such cure. In the event that such cure is not forthcoming, such default shall entitle the city to compel compliance by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction and if, upon final judgment, not subject to further appeal, being entered in favor of the city, the company remains in default of any provision of this ordinance or the final judgment, the city may declare this ordinance to be forfeited and canceled. Prior to a decision from such court, the company shall have the right to operate its facilities pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance. 
12.03.  The company further agrees, that if, for any reason other than an event of force majeure, the company fails to pay the franchise fees as provided in this ordinance within 45 days following written notice from the city that the company has failed to make payment, such failure shall be sufficient to permit the city to forfeit the franchise without court action. For the purposes of this section, an "event of force majeure" means any event or circumstance or combination of events or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the company that materially and adversely affects or affect the performance by the company of its obligations under or pursuant to this ordinance including but not limited to, an act of God; act of civil or military authority; act of war; (whether declared or undeclared); act (including delay, failure to act, or priority) of any governmental authority (including the city); civil disturbance; insurrection or riot; sabotage; fire; inclement weather conditions; earthquake; flood; strike; work stoppage or other labor difficulty; embargo; major electronic payment processing equipment breakdown; or other failure or delay beyond it's reasonable control. The company's financial inability to perform shall expressly be excluded from force majeure events. In the event that any of the above force majeure circumstances prevent the timely payment of franchise fees, the company shall notify the city within 24 hours. 
Sec. 13. - Additional regulations. 
13.01.  Company shall comply with the customer service standards on file in the city secretary office, as may be amended from time to time. In the event that the company amends such standards, the city shall be provided 15 days notice of such change prior to implementation. 
13.02.  The city reserves the right to adopt, in addition to the provisions included in this ordinance, such additional reasonable regulations as it shall find necessary with respect to governing the use of its public rights-of-way; provided, however, that if such regulations are in conflict with the privileges granted by this ordinance, the company shall notify the city in writing of the point of conflict believed to exist. If the city determines that a material provision of this franchise does in fact conflict with additional regulations, the parties shall enter into good faith negotiations to modify any provision hereof to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose of this franchise. In the event that there is conflict between requirements of this ordinance and other lawful and generally applicable city ordinances governing company's ability to use the public rights-of-way, the company and city agree to reserve their respective rights with respect to such conflict. 
Sec. 14. - Paragraph headings construction. 
    The paragraph headings contained in this ordinance are for convenience only and shall in no way enlarge or limit the scope or meaning of the various and several paragraphs hereof. Both parties have participated in the preparation of this ordinance and this ordinance shall not be construed either more or less strongly against or for either party. 
Sec. 15. - Effective date. 
    This ordinance shall become effective on August 4, 2002.

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the amendment to the gas franchise with TXU Gas Distribution, a division of TXU Gas Company, as amended by Ordinance No. 12-17-02H on December 17, 2002. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform, and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

Sec. 1. - Amendment. 
    The existing gas franchise ordinance between the City and TXU Gas Company is amended as follows: 
A.  Effective January 1, 2002, the consideration payable by TXU Gas for the rights and privileges granted to TXU Gas by the franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of this city and duly accepted by TXU Gas is hereby changed to be four percent of the gross revenues, as defined in subsection B of this section, received by TXU Gas. 
B.  "Gross revenues" shall mean all revenue derived or received, directly or indirectly, by the company from or in connection with the operation of the system within the corporate limits of the city and including, without limitation: 
(1)  All revenues received by the company from the sale of gas to all classes of customers within the city; 
(2)  All revenues received by the company from the transportation of gas through the pipeline system of company within the city to customers located within the city; 
(3)  The value of gas transported by company for transport customers through the system of company within the city ("third party sales"), with the value of such gas to be reported by each transport customer to the company, provided, however, that should a transport customer refuse to furnish company its gas purchase price, company shall estimate same by utilizing TXU Gas Distribution's monthly industrial weighted average cost of gas, as reasonably near the time as the transportation service is performed; and 
(4)  "Gross revenues" shall include: 
(a)  Other revenues derived from the following miscellaneous charges: 
i.  Charges to connect, disconnect, or reconnect gas within the city; 
ii.  Charges to handle returned checks from consumers within the city; 
iii.  Such other service charges and charges as may, from time to time, be authorized in the rates and charges on file with the city; and 
iv.  Contributions in aid of construction (CIAC); 
(b)  Revenues billed but not ultimately collected or received by the company; and, 
(c)  Gross receipts fees. 
(5)  "Gross revenues" shall not include: 
(a)  The revenue of any person including, without limitation, an affiliate, to the extent that such revenue is also included in gross revenues of the company; 
(b)  Sales taxes; and 
(c)  Any interest income earned by the company; and 
(d)  All monies received from the lease or sale of real or personal property, provided, however, that this exclusion does not apply to the lease of facilities within the city's right-of-way. 
C.  Calculation and payment of franchise fees based on CIAC. 
(1)  The franchise fee amounts based on contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) shall be calculated on an annual calendar year basis, i.e., from January 1 through December 31 of each calendar year. 
(2)  The franchise fee amounts that are due based on CIAC shall be paid at least once annually on or before April 30 each year based on the total CIAC recorded during the preceding calendar year. 
D.  Effect of other municipal franchise ordinance fees accepted and paid by TXU Gas. 
(1)  If TXU Gas should at any time after the effective date of this ordinance agree to a new municipal franchise ordinance, or renew an existing municipal franchise ordinance, with another municipality, which municipal franchise ordinance determines the franchise fee owed to that municipality for the use of its public rights-of-way in a manner that, if applied to the city, would result in a franchise fee greater than the amount otherwise due city under this ordinance, then the franchise fee to be paid by TXU Gas to city pursuant to this ordinance shall be increased so that the amount due and to be paid is equal to the amount that would be due and payable to city were the franchise fee provisions of that other franchise ordinance applied to city. 
(2)  The provisions of this subsection D apply only to the amount of the franchise fee to be paid and do not apply to other franchise fee payment provisions, including without limitation the timing of such payments. 
E.  TXU Gas franchise fee recovery tariff. 
(1)  TXU Gas may file with the city a tariff amendment to provide for the recovery of the franchise fees under this amendment. 
(2)  City agrees that (i) as regulatory authority, it will adopt and approve the ordinance, rates or tariff which provide for 100 percent recovery of such franchise fees as part of TXU Gas' rates; (ii) if the city intervenes in any regulatory proceeding before a federal or state agency in which the recovery of TXU Gas' franchise fees is an issue, the city will take an affirmative position supporting 100 percent recovery of such franchise fees by TXU Gas and; (iii) in the event of an appeal of any such regulatory proceeding in which the city has intervened, the city will take an affirmative position in any such appeals in support of the 100 percent recovery of such franchise fees by TXU Gas. 
(3)  City agrees that it will take no action, nor cause any other person or entity to take any action, to prohibit the recovery of such franchise fees by TXU Gas. 
F.  Lease of facilities within city's rights-of-way. TXU Gas shall have the right to lease, license or otherwise grant to a party other than TXU Gas the use of its facilities within the city's public rights-of-way provided: (i) TXU Gas first notifies the city of the name of the lessee, licensee or user; the type of service intended to be provided through the facilities; and the name and telephone number of a contact person associated with such lessee, licensee or user and (ii) TXU Gas makes the franchise fee payment due on the revenues from such lease pursuant to subsections A. and B. of this section. This authority to lease facilities within city's rights-of-way shall not affect any such lessee, licensee or user's obligation, if any, to pay franchise fees. 
Sec. 2. - Existing franchise to remain in force and effect. 
    In all respects, except as specifically and expressly amended by this ordinance, the existing effective franchise ordinance heretofore duly passed by the governing body of the city and duly accepted by TXU Gas shall remain in full force and effect according to its terms until such franchise ordinance terminates as provided therein. 
[DIVISION 3. - TRANSFER OF CONTROL] 

[Sec. 1. - Transfer of control of TXU Gas Company to LSG and/or Atmos Energy.] 
    That the city council consents to the transfer of control of TXU Gas to LSG and/or Atmos Energy and agrees that the franchise granted by the city to TXU Gas will continue in full force and effect on and after the date of the merger between TXU Gas and LSG and/or Atmos Energy. If the merger of TXU Gas and LSG and/or Atmos Energy does not occur, then this consent will be null and void. 
(Ord. No. 09-21-04B, § 1, 9-21-2004) 
[Sec. 2. - Transfer of control of cable service franchise.] 
    [The city approves the transfer of the cable franchise agreement from Comcast Cable of Texas II, Inc. to C-Native Exchange IIA, LP.]
