PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Mesquite. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1960 Code, as supplemented through December 19, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1960 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Robert Courtre', Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. B. J. Smith, City Attorney, and Ms. Lynn Prugel, City Secretary, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
MUNICIPAL CODE CORPORATION

    Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the city council to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

Where the advocacy of the right or privilege is usual and frequent or can reasonably be expected to arise in due course of one's occupation or profession, then such officer or employee shall remove himself from his position with the city, or so much of such position as may be incompatible, until such position of incompatibility ceases to exist.

The lessee assures that no person shall be excluded on these grounds from participating in or receiving the services or benefits of any program or activity covered by this subpart. The lessee assures that it will require that its covered suborganizations provide assurances to the lessee that they similarly will undertake affirmative action programs and that they will require assurances from their suborganizations, as required by 14 CFR Part 152, Subpart E, to the same effect. 
d.  That in the event of breach of any of the preceding nondiscrimination covenants, lessor shall have the right to terminate the license, lease, permit, etc., and to reenter and repossess said land and the facilities thereon, and hold the same as if said lease had never been made or issued.

This provision is not intended to prevent damages for improvements subject to the laws of eminent domain. 
(15)  No fixed base operators, commercial operators or tenants shall sublease or sublet any premises leased by such operator from the city, or assign any such lease, without the prior written approval of the city, and any such subletting or assignment shall be subject to all of the minimum standards herein set forth. 
(16)  In the event the lessee sublets any portion of his lease, the sublessee must agree to assume the full obligations of the lease as set out herein and must agree to fully cooperate with the city in seeing that these standards are complied with. The sublessee shall immediately comply with any reasonable request or direction of the city as it relates to the enforcement of these standards.

d.  The dissolution or liquidation of lessee or the filing by lessee of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or failure by lessee within sixty (60) days to lift any execution, garnishment or attachment of such consequence as will impair its ability to carry on its operations at the leased premises, or the adjudication of lessee as bankrupt, or general assignment by lessee for the benefit of its creditors, or the approval by a court of competent jurisdiction of a petition applicable to lessee in any proceeding for its reorganization instituted under the provisions of the general bankruptcy act, as amended, or under any similar act which may hereafter be enacted. 
(18)  Remedies on default. Whenever any event of default as to lessee referred to above shall have happened and be subsisting, the city may take any one (1) or more of the following remedial steps as against lessee: 
a.  The city may re-enter and take possession of the leased premises without terminating this agreement and sublease (or operate as a sublease) the leased premises for the account of lessee, holding lessee liable for the difference between the rents or other amounts payable by lessee hereunder and the rents and other amounts payable by such sublessee in such subleasing or, if operated by the city, the difference between the net revenues received from such operations and the rents and other amounts payable by lessee hereunder. 
b.  The city may terminate this agreement. 
c.  The city may take whatever other action at law or in equity as may appear necessary or desirable to collect the rent then due and thereafter to become due, or to enforce performance and observance of any obligation, agreement, or covenant of lessee under this agreement.

    Airport means Mesquite Metro Airport. 
    Airport elevation means the established elevation of the highest point on the usable landing area, measured in feet from mean sea level. The elevation of Mesquite Metro Airport is four hundred forty-four (444) feet above mean sea level located on the runway centerline of the end of runway 17. 
    Airport hazard means any structure or tree or use of land which obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft or which obstructs or interferes with the control, tracking and/or data acquisition in the landing, taking off, or flight at an airport, or at any installation of facility relating to flight, tracking, and/or data acquisition of the flight craft; is hazardous, interferes with or obstructs such landing, taking off or flight of aircraft; or which is hazardous to or interferes with tracking and/or data acquisition pertaining to flight and flight vehicles. 
    Airport hazard area means any area of land or water upon which an airport hazard might be established if not prevented as provided in this division. 
    Airport reference point means the point established as the approximate geographic center of the airport landing area and so designated. The airport reference point (ARP) for Mesquite Metro Airport is Latitude 32°44'43.4?N; Longitude 96°31'49.2?W. 
    Approach surface means a surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline, extending outward and upward from the end of the primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone height limitation slope set forth in section 3-144 of this division. In plan, the perimeter of the approach surface coincides with the perimeter of the approach zone. 
    Approach, transitional, horizontal, and conical zones. These zones are set forth in section 3-143 of this division.

Sec. 3-143. - Zones. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this division, there are hereby created and established certain zones, which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transition surfaces, horizontal surface and conical surface as they apply to the Mesquite Metro Airport. Such zones are shown on the hazard zoning map consisting of one (1) sheet, prepared by the Texas Department of Transportation, Division of Aviation, Austin, Texas, and dated September 9, 1991, and revised October 14, 1992, which is adopted by this division and made a part hereof. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Approach zones. Approach zones are established beneath the approach surfaces at the ends of Runway 17-35 at Mesquite Metro Airport for precision instrument landings and take-offs. The inner edge of the approach zones shall have a width of one thousand (1,000) feet which coincides with the width of the primary surface at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond the ends of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a horizontal distance of fifty thousand (50,000) feet beyond the ends of the primary surface, the centerlines being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established beneath the transition surface adjacent to each runway and approach surface as indicated on the hazard zoning map. Transition surfaces, symmetrically located on either side of the runway, have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transitional surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at right angles to the runway centerline. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. The area beneath a horizontal plane one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of ten thousand (10,000) feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of Runway 17-35 and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. 
(4)  Conical zone. The area beneath the conical surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slop of twenty to one (20:1) for a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet.

Sec. 3-144. - Height limitations. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this division, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this division to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Approach zones. One (1) foot in height for each fifty (50) feet in horizontal distance beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a point ten thousand (10,000) feet from the end of the primary surface, then rising one (1) foot in height for each forty feet in horizontal distance for an additional forty thousand (40,000) feet. 
(2)  Transition zones. Slopes seven (7) feet outward for each one (1) foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation or to a height of five hundred ninety-four (594) feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each one (1) foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for one (1) foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured at ninety-degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. Established at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation, or a height five hundred ninety-four (594) feet above mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical zone. Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each one (1) foot upward, beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation or to a height of seven hundred ninety-four (794) feet above mean sea level. 
(5)  Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this division shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to fifty (50) feet above the surface of the land. 
(Ord. No. 2943, § 1, 12-6-93) 
Sec. 3-145. - Land use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this division, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this division, in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the Mesquite Metro Airport. 
(Ord. No. 2943, § 1, 12-6-93; Res. No. 11-20-95) 
Sec. 3-146. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this division shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date (December 12, 1983) of this division, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this division, and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the city manager or his designated representative, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the city.

Sec. 3-147. - Permits. 
(a)  Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (a)(1), (2) and (3) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land that would create a hazardous condition as described in section 3-145, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be permitted to grow in any zone hereby created in excess of the excepted height limitations allowed in section 3-144(5), unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this division shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with section 3-147(d). 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zones, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, the same would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(2)  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
(3)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transitional zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transitional zone. 
    Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this division, except as set forth in section 3-144(5). 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the creation or establishment of any airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on December 6, 1983 or on the effective date of any amendments to this division, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the city manager or his designated representative determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property, in violation of the regulations prescribed in this division, may apply to the airport board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations in question. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but do substantial justice to, and be in accordance with the spirit of, this division. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this division may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the City of Mesquite Airport Advisory Board for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the City of Mesquite Airport Advisory Board does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the airport board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny the application. The board may impose any reasonable condition on the variance that it considers necessary to accomplish the purposes of this division. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable by the city manager or his designated representative or the airport board of adjustment to effectuate the purpose of this division and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to allow the city manager or his designated representative to install, operate and maintain, at the expense of the city, such markings and lights as may be necessary.

Provided, however, that in special instances wherein an animal has been injured to the extent that a three-day waiting period would constitute cruel treatment such waiting period would not be applicable. 
(d)  For the purposes of this section such injury shall be deemed to constitute a special instance making the three-day waiting period inapplicable when it reasonably appears that the injury is terminal or will result in substantial physical impairment and causes extreme pain. Examples of conditions indicating such state are substantial blood loss, severed spine, severance of a substantial portion of a member or other portion of the body and other conditions commonly known to result in death. 
(e)  Decisions on such conditions shall be made by the person or persons designated by the environmental health official or his designee and, when made in good faith, shall be presumed correct and shall not be subject to review, due to the emergency nature of such determination.

ARTICLE VI. - VICIOUS ANIMALS 

Sec. 4-156. - Definition. 
    As used in this article, the term "vicious animal" means any animal, except a dog assisting a peace officer engaged in law enforcement duties, which without provocation attacks or bites any human being or any domestic animal or which has a known propensity to attack or bite human beings or animals, including a dangerous dog as defined in V.T.C.A. Health and Safety Code, Chapter 822, Subchapter D, but not including an animal which bites, attacks or menaces a trespasser on the property of its owner or harms or menaces anyone who has tormented, tortured, or exhibited cruelty to such animal. 
(Code 1960, § 4-30; Ord. No. 3231, § 1D, 6-15-98) 
Sec. 4-157. - Generally. 
(a)  No animal of fierce, dangerous or vicious propensities, whether, licensed or not, shall be allowed in the city; provided, however, that dogs used by law enforcement authorities or approved by the animal control supervisor as watch dogs for business establishments and securely confined thereto shall not be deemed within this provision. 
(b)  A peace officer or the supervisor of animal control may use such force as is reasonably necessary to protect members of the public from any vicious dog or other animal wherein the actions of such animal reasonably appear to constitute an imminent threat of injury to any human being or domestic animal, including, when necessary, taking such animal's life. 
(c)  When the supervisor of animal control has determined upon the criteria set forth herein that an animal is vicious and is being kept and harbored in the city he may, in addition to the criminal sanctions imposed herein, take the following steps to abate such violation which is herein declared to be a nuisance: 
(1)  Give written notice to the owner or person having control over the vicious animal or the property upon which the animal is kept or harbored to cease and desist the keeping and harboring of a vicious animal in the city within twenty-four (24) hours. A notice provided for in this section is properly served when it is delivered to the owner of the animal or custodian-in charge, or when it is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the owner or custodian of the animal. 
(2)  Upon failure of the owner or person in control of the vicious animal or in control of the property wherein the animal is kept or harbored to comply with the notice, the supervisor of animal control may make affidavit setting forth the facts indicting that such animal is vicious and constitutes an imminent threat to the life and safety of the public by reason thereof and make application to the judge of the municipal court for a warrant to go upon the premises and secure and impound such vicious animal to be held by animal control pending a hearing if requested by the owner or person having control over the animal or over the property wherein the animal was seized. If no request for hearing has been made within ten (10) days, the animal may be disposed of as in other cases but shall not be let for adoption. Provided, however, that the owner or person from whom the animal was seized may reclaim the animal any time upon assurance satisfactory to the supervisor of animal control, or in case of dispute between the parties, a cash escrow deposit set by the municipal judge, that said party will comply with said order of the supervisor of animal control until such time as it may be determined that the order was issued in error and that the keeping of such animal in the city poses no threat or hazard of injury to a human being. 
(3)  The hearing provided for in this section shall be conducted before the municipal court as provided for in V.T.C.A. Health and Safety Code, Section 822.042, as amended. 
(d)  The owner of a vicious or dangerous animal shall be held strictly liable for any violation of this section and for any damages caused hereby.

    Air-gap means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet conveying water or waste to a tank, plumbing fixture, receptor, or other assembly and the flood level rim of the receptacle. These vertical, physical separations must be at least twice the diameter of the water supply outlet, never less than one (1) inch (twenty-five (25) mm). 
    Approved means accepted by the authority responsible as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this division or as suitable for the proposed use. 
    Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the City of Mesquite's approved public water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source(s), such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, and so forth, used waters or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted, or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the City of Mesquite does not have sanitary control. 
    Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow in a potable water distribution system as a result of a cross-connection. 
    Backflow preventor means an assembly or means designed to prevent backflow, such as an air-gap, reduced-pressure backflow prevention assembly or double check valve assembly. 
    Backpressure means a pressure, higher than the supply pressure, caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler, or any other means that may cause backflow. 
    Backsiphonage means backflow caused by negative or reduced pressure in the supply piping. 
    City official means the Utilities Superintendent in charge of the Water Department of the City of Mesquite and invested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this division.

    Controlled cross-connection means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow preventor properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
    Cross-connection means a connection or potential connection between any part of a potable water system and any other environment containing other substances in a manner that, under any circumstances, would allow such substances to enter the potable water system. Other substances may be gases, liquids, or solids, such as chemicals, waste products, steam, water from other sources (potable or nonpotable), or any matter that may change the color or add odor to the water. 
    Cross-connection control by containment means the installation of an approved backflow preventor at the water service connection to any customer's premises, where it is physically and economically unfeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections within the customer's water system; or it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow preventor on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections that cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection. 
    Double check valve assembly means the approved backflow preventor consisting of two (2) internally loaded check valves, either spring loaded or internally weighted, installed as a unit between two (2) tightly closing resilient-seated shutoff valves and fittings with properly located resilient-seated test cocks. This assembly shall only be used to protect against a non-health hazard (that is, a pollutant). 
    Hazard, degree of. The term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system. Hazards include, but are not limited to, the following types: 
(1)  Health hazard means a cross-connection or potential cross-connection involving any substance that could, if introduced in the potable water supply, cause death, illness, spread disease, or has a high probability of causing such effects. 
(2)  Non-health hazard means a cross-connection or potential cross-connection involving any substance that generally would not be a health hazard but would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable, if introduced into the potable water supply. 
(3)  Plumbing hazard means a plumbing-type cross-connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by an approved air-gap or an approved backflow preventor. 
(4)  System hazard means an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the customer's potable water system or of a pollution or contamination that would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system. 
    Industrial fluids system means any system containing a fluid or solution that may be chemically, biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration, such as would constitute pollution or a health, system, or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include, but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and used waters originating from the public potable water system that may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form, plating acids and alkali's; circulating cooling waters connected to an open cooling tower; and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters, such as wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, and so forth; oils, gases, glycerin, paraffin's, caustic and acid solutions, and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes for fire-fighting purposes. 
    Nonpotable water means water that is not safe for human consumption or that is of questionable quality.

    Potable water means water that is safe for human consumption as described by the public health authority having jurisdiction. 
    Reduced-pressure backflow prevention assembly means the approved backflow preventor consisting of two (2) independently acting approved check valves together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure differential relief valve located between the check valves and below the first check valve. These units are located between two (2) tightly closing resilient-seated shutoff valves as an assembly and equipped with properly located resilient-seated test cocks. 
    Service connection means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, that is, where the City of Mesquite loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow preventor located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service connection shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system. 
    Used water means any water supplied by the City of Mesquite or other water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.

109.2 Immediate securement. Notwithstanding other provisions of this code, whenever, in the opinion of the Code Official, the structure or any part thereof is an imminent danger, or regardless of its structural condition, the structure is unsecured from unauthorized entry to the extent that it could be entered or used by vagrants or other uninvited persons as a place of harborage or could be entered or used by children, the Code Official may perform the necessary work to close up or secure the structure so as not to be an attractive nuisance and to prevent unlawful entry, or render such structure temporarily safe, whether or not the legal procedure herein described has been instituted; and shall cause such other action to be taken as the Code Official deems necessary to meet such emergency.

(a)  Assessment of impact fees for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For land which is unplatted at the time of application for a building permit or utility connection, or for a new development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this chapter and for which no replatting is necessary pursuant to the City's subdivision regulations prior to development, assessment shall occur at the time application is made for the building permit or utility connection, whichever occurs first, and shall be the amount of the maximum impact fee per service unit then in effect, as set forth in Schedule 1. 
(2)  For a new development which is submitted for approval pursuant to the City's subdivision regulations after the effective date of this chapter, or for which replatting results in an increase in the number of service units after such date, assessment shall be at the time of final plat approval, and shall be the amount of the maximum impact fee per service unit then in effect, as set forth in Schedule 1. 
(b)  Following initial assessment of the impact fees for a new development pursuant to Subsection (a), the amount of the maximum impact fee per service unit for that development cannot be increased, unless the owner proposes to change the approved development by the submission of a new development application, in which case the impact fee will be reassessed at the Schedule 1 rate then in effect for such additional service units. 
(c)  Following the lapse or expiration of approval of a new development, a new assessment shall be performed at the time a new application for such development is filed. 
(Ord. No. 4366, § 1, 7-6-2015) 
Sec. 7.5-10. - Calculation of impact fees. 
(a)  At the time of application for a building permit or the utility connection for new development, the City shall compute the impact fees due for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  The amount of each impact fee due shall be determined by multiplying the number of service units generated by the new development by the impact fee due per service unit for the service area using Schedule 2. The number of service units shall be determined according to Section 7.5-7. 
(2)  The amount of each impact fee due shall be reduced by any allowable credits for that category of capital improvements, in the manner provided in Section 7.5-12. 
(b)  The amount of each impact fee due for a new development shall not exceed an amount computed by multiplying the maximum impact fee per service unit under Schedule 1 by the number of service units generated by the development. 
(c)  Whenever the property owner proposes to increase the number of service units for a development, the additional impact fees collected for such new service units shall be determined by using Schedule 2 then in effect and such additional fee shall be collected either prior to or at the time of issuance of a new building permit, or prior to or at the time of enlargement of the connection to the City's water or wastewater system. 
(Ord. No. 4366, § 1, 7-6-2015) 
Sec. 7.5-11. - Collection of impact fees. 
(a)  For all new developments, the impact fees due shall be collected at the time of application for a building permit, or at the time of application for a utility connection, whichever occurs first, unless an agreement between the developer and the City has been executed providing for a different time of payment. If the building permit for which an impact fee has been paid has expired, and a new application is thereafter filed, the impact fees due shall be computed using Schedule 2 then in effect, and previous payments of impact fees shall be credited against the new fees due. 
(b)  For a new development for which a final plat was approved prior to the effective date of these regulations and for which a building permit is issued within one year of such effective date, the impact fee due shall be computed using the Schedule 2 then in effect prior to the effective date; provided that a building permit that expires or is withdrawn for such development shall be subject to collection of impact fees using the Schedule 2 rate herein. 
(Ord. No. 4366, § 1, 7-6-2015) 
Sec. 7.5-12. - Credits against impact fees. 
(a)  A property owner who constructs or dedicates an area related facility or advances funds for the construction of an area related facility may reduce impact fees due for the new development for that category of capital improvement by the value of such improvement or contribution, pursuant to rules established in this section or pursuant to administrative guidelines promulgated by the City. The credit shall be associated with the plat of the property that is to be served by the capital improvement constructed. 
(b)  All offsets and credits against impact fees shall be based upon standards promulgated by the City, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines, including the following standards: 
(1)  No credit shall be given for the dedication or construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  No credit shall exceed an amount equal to the eligible costs of the improvement multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the impact fee per service unit due for the new development as computed using Schedule 2 and the denominator of which is the maximum impact fee per service unit for the new development as computed using Schedule 1. 
(3)  The unit costs used to calculate credits shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the impact fees capital improvements plan for the category of facility for which the impact fee is imposed. 
(4)  No credit or offset shall be given for an area-related facility which is not identified within the applicable impact fees capital improvements plan. 
(5)  In no event will the City reimburse the property owner or developer for a credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to these impact fee regulations or for any amount exceeding the total impact fees due for the development for that category of capital improvements, unless otherwise agreed to by the City. 
(6)  No credits shall be given where the City participates in the costs of the capital improvements, pursuant to Section (e). 
(c)  Credits created pursuant to this ordinance shall expire within 10 years from the date the credit was created. Credits for prior subdivision improvement requirements before the effective date of this ordinance shall expire within 10 years from the date credit is given under this ordinance. 
(d)  An applicant for new development shall apply for a credit against impact fees due for the development either at the time of application for final plat approval or at the time of building permit application, unless the City agrees to a different time. The applicant shall file a petition for credits with the City on a form provided for such purpose. The City must provide the applicant, in writing, with a decision on the credit request, specifying the maximum value of the credit which may be applied against an impact fee. 
(e)  After the effective date of this ordinance, credits for construction of capital improvements to be applied against impact fees due shall be determined in accordance with an agreement for capital improvements pursuant to Section 7.5-19. The agreement required may provide for participation by the City in the costs of the capital improvement to be constructed by the property owner, as provided in the City's subdivision regulations. The amount of any credit shall be reduced by the amount of the City's participation. 
(f)  A credit associated with a plat shall be applied to reduce impact fees at the time of application for the first building permit or at the time of application for the first utility connection for the property and, thereafter, to all subsequently issued building permits or utility connections, until the credit is exhausted, unless the City agrees otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 4366, § 1, 7-6-2015) 
Sec. 7.5-13. - Establishment of accounts.

(Ord. No. 4366, § 1, 7-6-2015) 
Sec. 7.5-16. - Refunds and rebates. 
(a)  Upon application, any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to these regulations, which has not been expended within the service area within 10 years from the date of payment, shall be refunded to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in Section 302.002, Finance Code, or its successor statute. The application for refund pursuant to this section shall be submitted within 60 days after the expiration of the 10-year period for expenditure of the fee. An impact fee shall be considered expended on a first-in, first out basis. 
(b)  An impact fee collected pursuant to these regulations shall also be considered expended if the total expenditures for capital improvements or facility expansion authorized in Section 7.5-14 within the service area within 10 years following the date of payment exceeds the total fees collected within the service area for such improvements or expansions during such period. 
(c)  Upon application, any impact fee for water and wastewater facilities or portion thereof collected pursuant to these regulations shall be refunded if: 
(1)  Existing service is available and service is denied; or 
(2)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and the City has failed to commence construction of facilities to provide service within two years of fee payment; or 
(3)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and has not subsequently been made available within a reasonable period of time considering the type of capital improvement or facility expansion to be constructed, but in any event later than five years from the date of fee payment. 
(d)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a), (b) or (c), the City shall divide the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(e)  Upon completion of all the capital improvements or facility expansion identified in the capital improvements plan for the service area, the City shall recalculate the maximum impact fee per service unit using the actual costs for the improvements or expansions. If the maximum impact fee per service unit based on actual cost is less than the impact fee per service unit paid, the City shall refund the difference, if such difference exceeds the impact fee paid by more than 10 percent. If the difference is less than 10 percent, no refund shall be due. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying such difference by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(f)  No refunds or credits against impact fees due shall be given for decreasing the number or size of water meters serving a development, except as provided herein. If a tract of land for which an impact fee has been paid is replatted, resulting in a reduction in the number of service units, and the new impact fee to be collected is less than that paid, the City shall refund the difference, provided that water meters to serve the development have not been installed. 
(g)  If the building permit for a new development for which an impact fee has been paid has expired, no utility connections for that category of capital improvements have been made to the development, and a modified or new application has not been filed within six months of such expiration, the City shall, upon written application, rebate the amount of the impact fee to the record owner of the property for which the impact fee was paid. If no application for rebate pursuant to this subsection has been filed within this period, no rebate shall become due. 
(Ord. No. 4366, § 1, 7-6-2015) 
Sec. 7.5-17. - Updates to plan and revision of fees. 
(a)  The City shall update its land use assumptions and capital improvements plans at least every five years, commencing from the date of adoption of such plans, and shall recalculate the impact fees based thereon in accordance with the procedures set forth in, Chapter 395, or in any successor statute. 
(b)  The City may review its land use assumptions, impact fees, capital improvements plans and other factors such as market conditions more frequently than provided in Subsection (a) to determine whether the land use assumptions and capital improvements plans should be updated and the impact fee recalculated accordingly, or whether Schedules 1 or 2 should be changed. Schedule 2 may be amended without revising land use assumptions and capital improvements plans at any time prior to the update provided for in Subsection (a), provided that the impact fees to be collected under Schedule 2 do not exceed the impact fees assessed under Schedule 1. 
(c)  If, at the time an update is required pursuant to Subsection (a), the City Council determines that no change to the land use assumptions, capital improvements plan or impact fee is needed, it may dispense with such update by following the procedures in Section 395.0575 of Chapter 395. 
(d)  The City may amend Table 1, the Service Unit Equivalency Table for Water and Wastewater Facilities, and Table 2, the Land Use/Vehicle Mile Equivalency Table for Roadway Facilities, at any time prior to the update provided for in Subsection (a); provided that the number of service units associated with a particular land use shall not be increased.

(a)  An owner of a new development may dedicate, construct or finance a capital improvement or facility expansion designated in the capital improvements plan, if required or authorized by the City, by entering into an agreement with the City prior to fee collection for the development. The agreement shall be on a form approved by the City, and shall identify the estimated cost of the improvement or expansion, the schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement or expansion, a requirement that the improvement be designed and completed to City standards and such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the City. The Director shall review the improvement plan, verify costs and time schedules, determine if the improvement is contained in the capital improvement plan ("CIP"), and determine the amount of the credit to be given against impact fees due for the development before submitting the proposed agreement to the City Council for approval. 
(b)  The City and such owner either may agree that the costs incurred or funds advanced will be credited against the impact fees otherwise due from the new development, or they may agree that the City shall reimburse the owner for such costs from impact fees paid from other new developments which will use such capital improvements or facility expansions, or from other funding sources. In the event that the City elects to reimburse an owner for the dedication, construction or financing of a capital improvement or facility expansion designated in the capital improvements plan, the terms of reimbursement shall be incorporated in the agreement required by Subsection (a). 
(Ord. No. 4366, § 1, 7-6-2015) 
Sec. 7.5-20. - Use of other financing mechanisms. 
(a)  The City may finance capital improvements or facility expansion designated in the capital improvements plan through the issuance of bonds, through the formation of public utility districts or other assessment districts, or through any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law, in addition to the use of impact fees. 
(b)  Except as herein otherwise provided, the assessment and collection of an impact fee shall be additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other tax, fee, charge or assessment which is lawfully imposed on and due against the property. 
(c)  The City may pay all or a part of impact fees due for a new development pursuant to duly adopted criteria. 
(Ord. No. 4366, § 1, 7-6-2015) 
Sec. 7.5-21. - Impact fee as additional and supplemental regulation. 
(a)  Impact fees established by these regulations are additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the City on the development of land or the issuance of building permits, the sale of water or wastewater taps, or certificates of occupancy. Such fee is intended to be consistent with and to further the policies of City's comprehensive land use plan, the capital improvements plan, the zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations and other City policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the City seeks to ensure the provision of adequate public facilities in conjunction with the development of land. 
(b)  This ordinance shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density of development, design, and improvement standards and requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision of public improvements subject to the zoning and subdivision regulations or other regulations of the City, which shall be operative and remain in full force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development.

(a)  Any person who has paid an impact fee or an owner of land upon which an impact fee has been paid may petition the City Council to determine whether any duty required by this chapter has not been performed within the time so prescribed. The petition shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the unperformed duty and request that the duty be performed within 60 days of the request. If the City Council determines that the duty is required pursuant to the chapter and is late in being performed, it shall cause the duty to commence within 60 days of the date of the request and to continue until completion. This subsection is not applicable to matters which may be appealed pursuant to Section 7.5-15. 
(b)  The City Council may grant a variance from any requirement of this chapter, upon written request by a developer or owner of property subject to the chapter, following a public hearing, and only upon finding that a strict application of such requirement would, when regarded as a whole, result in confiscation of the property. If the City Council grants a variance to the amount of the impact fee due for a new development under this subsection, it shall cause to be appropriated from other City funds the amount of the reduction in the impact fee to the account for the service area in which the property is located. 
(c)  The City Council may authorize abatement from payment of impact fees in whole or in part upon a written request by the property owner or developer subject to the chapter, following a public hearing and upon a finding that such abatement will advance significant economic development objectives as may be hereafter set forth in administrative guidelines adopted by resolution, and is in the best interests of the public health, safety, welfare and morals.

(a)  Purpose. This article implements a photographic traffic signal enforcement system and provides that the owner of a motor vehicle is liable to the city for a civil penalty if, while facing only a steady red signal displayed by an electrically operated traffic control signal located in the city, the vehicle is operated in violation of the instructions of that traffic control signal as specified by Section 544.007(d) of the Texas Transportation Code. This article further provides definitions, enforcement procedures, administrative adjudication hearings, imposition of civil penalties for violations, which civil penalty is not a criminal conviction for any purpose, and procedures to collect said penalties and fees from imposition of civil liability which shall be deposited in a traffic safety fund account. 
(b)  Application. This article applies to the issuance of a notice of violation for proceeding into an intersection when the traffic control signal for that vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal alleging a civil penalty not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by state law within the jurisdiction of the municipal court. The procedures of this article apply only to offenses alleged to occur on or after the date of enactment.

i.  A statement that the owner of the vehicle in the notice of violation may elect to pay the civil penalty by mail sent to a specified address instead of appearing at the time and place of the administrative adjudication hearing; and 
j.  Information that informs the owner of the vehicle named in the notice of violation: 
1.  Of the owner's right to contest the imposition of the civil penalty against the person in an administrative adjudication hearing; 
2.  That imposition of the civil penalty may be contested by submitting a written request for an administrative adjudication hearing before the expiration of the period specified under subsection (2)(h); and 
3.  That failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability for the penalty in a timely manner is an admission of liability and a waiver of the owner's right to appeal the imposition of the civil penalty. 
k.  A statement that a recorded image of the motor vehicle involved in the violation will be used as evidence in a proceeding for the imposition of a civil penalty; 
l.  A statement that allegation and evidence of a culpable mental state is not required and that proof for the imposition of a civil penalty for the violation will be by a preponderance of the evidence;

(Ord. No. 3879, § 2, 8-20-07) 
Sec. 9-289. - Administrative adjudication hearing. 
(a)  Request for hearing. A person who receives a notice of violation may contest the imposition of the civil penalty by requesting in writing an administrative adjudication hearing of the civil penalty within thirty (30) days after date of the notice of violation was received. Upon receipt of a timely request, the city shall notify the person of the date and time of the hearing on the administrative adjudication. The administrative adjudication hearing shall be held before the city manager or his designee who shall have the authority to administer oaths and issue orders compelling the attendance of witnesses and production of documents. 
(b)  Admission of liability. A person who fails to pay a civil penalty or to contest liability for the penalty in a timely manner or who requests an administrative adjudication hearing to contest the imposition of the civil penalty against the person and fails to appear at that hearing is considered to admit liability for the full amount of the civil penalty stated in the notice of violation mailed to the person and is a waiver of the person's right to appeal the imposition of the civil penalty. 
(c)  Presumption. 
(1)  It is presumed that the owner of the motor vehicle committed the violation alleged in the notice of violation mailed to the person if the motor vehicle depicted in a photograph or digital image taken by a photographic traffic signal enforcement system belongs to the owner of the motor vehicle. 
(2)  If, at the time of the violation alleged in the notice of violation, the motor vehicle depicted in a photograph or digital image taken by a photographic traffic signal enforcement system was owned by a person in the business of selling, renting or leasing motor vehicles or by a person who was not the person named in the notice of violation, the presumption is rebutted on the presentation of evidence establishing that the vehicle was at that time: 
a.  Being test driven by another person; 
b.  Being rented or leased by the vehicle's owner to another person; or 
c.  Owned by a person who was not the person named in the notice of violation. 
(3)  Notwithstanding Section 9-289(a), the presentation of evidence under subsection (2) by a person who is in the business of selling, renting or leasing motor vehicles or did not own the vehicle at the time of the violation must be made by affidavit through testimony at the administrative adjudication hearing or by a written declaration under penalty of perjury. The affidavit or written declaration may be submitted by mail to the city or the contracting entity. 
(4)  If the presumption established by Section 9-289(c)(1) is rebutted under Section 9-289(c)(2), a civil penalty may not be imposed on the owner of the vehicle or the person named in the notice of violation, as applicable. 
(5)  In the event of a rebuttal under Section 9-289(c)(2) the owner of the motor vehicle shall not later than the 30th day after the date the notice of violation is received provide to the city or the contracting entity the name and address of the individual who was renting or leasing the motor vehicle depicted in the photograph or digital image and a statement of the period during which that individual was renting or leasing the vehicle. If the owner provides the required information, it is presumed that the individual renting or leasing the motor vehicle committed the violation alleged in the notice of violation and the city or the contracting entity may send a notice of violation to that individual at the address provided by the owner of the motor vehicle. 
(d)  Hearing. 
(1)  In an administrative adjudication hearing, the issues must be proved at the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence. The reliability of the photographic traffic signal enforcement system used to produce the recorded image of the violation may be attested to in an administrative adjudication hearing by affidavit of an officer or employee of the city or of the entity with which the city contracts to install or operate the system and who is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system. An affidavit by such person that alleges a violation based on an inspection of the pertinent recorded image is admissible in a proceeding under this article and in an appeal under Section 2-289(g) and is evidence of the facts contained in the affidavit. 
(2)  At the conclusion of the administrative adjudication hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a finding of liability for the civil penalty or a finding of no liability for the civil penalty. A finding under this subsection must be in writing, signed and dated by the hearing officer. 
(3)  A finding of liability for a civil penalty must specify the amount of the civil penalty for which the person is liable. If the hearing officer enters a finding of no liability, a civil penalty for the violation may not be imposed against the person. 
(4)  A finding of liability or a finding of no liability entered under this section may: 
a.  Be filed with the clerk of the municipal court; and 
b.  Be recorded on microfilm or microfiche or using data processing techniques. 
(5)  A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing, or who requests an administrative adjudication hearing and thereafter fails to appear at the time and place of the hearing, is liable for administrative hearing costs in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) in addition to the amount of the civil penalty assessed for the violation. A person who is found liable for a civil penalty after an administrative adjudication hearing shall pay the civil penalty and costs within thirty-one (31) days of the date on which the administrative adjudication hearing officer entered the finding of civil liability. 
(e)  Affirmative defenses. 
(1)  It shall be an affirmative defense to the imposition of civil liability under this article to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence that: 
a.  The traffic control signal was not in proper position and sufficiently legible to an ordinarily observant person; 
b.  The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of a police officer; 
c.  The operator of the motor vehicle violated the instructions of the traffic control signal so as to yield the right-of-way to an immediately approaching authorized emergency vehicle; 
d.  The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle under Chapter 546 of the Texas Transportation Code and that the operator was acting in compliance with that chapter; 
e.  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle and being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner; 
f.  The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was a stolen plate and being displayed on a motor vehicle other than the motor vehicle for which the plate had been issued; 
g.  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually hazardous road conditions existed that would make compliance with this article more dangerous under the circumstances than noncompliance; 
h.  The person who received the notice of violation was not the owner of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation; or 
i.  The owner must submit proof acceptable to the hearing officer that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency to demonstrate that at the time of the violation the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate. 
(f)  Untimely request for administrative adjudication hearing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a person who receives a notice of violation under this chapter and who fails to pay the amount of the civil penalty or fails to timely request an administrative adjudication hearing is entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing if: 
(1)  The person submits a written request for the hearing to the designated hearing officer accompanied by an affidavit that attests to the date on which the person received the notice of violation; and 
(2)  The written request and affidavit are submitted to the hearing officer within the same number of days after the date the person received the notice of violation as specified under Section 9-288(b)(2)(h). 
(g)  Appeal. 
(1)  The owner of a motor vehicle determined by a hearing officer to be liable for a civil penalty may appeal that determination to the municipal court by filing an appeal petition with the clerk of the municipal court. The petition must be filed not later than the 31st day after the date on which the administrative adjudication hearing officer entered the finding of liability for the civil penalty and accompanied by payment of the costs required by law for the court. The Mesquite Municipal Court shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction within the municipality's territorial limits in a case arising under Chapter 707 of the Transportation Code. 
(2)  The court clerk shall schedule a hearing and notify the owner of the motor vehicle and the appropriate department, agency or office of the city of the date, time and place of the hearing. 
(3)  An appeal stays enforcement and collection of the civil penalty imposed against the owner of the motor vehicle. The owner shall file a notarized statement of personal financial obligation to perfect the owner's appeal. 
(4)  An appeal shall be determined by the municipal court by non-jury trial de novo only. 
(5)  The municipal court shall follow administrative hearing procedures and apply the rules of civil evidence with the express condition that the affidavits submitted under Section 9-289(d) shall be admitted by the municipal court judge in the trial de novo, and the issues must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(6)  A tape recording shall be made of all testimony given in the appeal of the administrative hearing before the municipal court. 
(7)  A person found liable by the municipal court shall pay an appellate filing fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) in addition to the civil penalty and any other fees due the city. 
(h)  Enforcement. If the owner of a motor vehicle is delinquent by more than ninety (90) days in the payment of a civil penalty imposed under this chapter in the minimum amount of seventy-five dollars ($75.00), the county assessor-collector or the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles may refuse to register a motor vehicle alleged to have been involved in the violation if it is owned by the same person that received the civil penalty. 
(i)  Imposition of civil penalty not a conviction. The imposition of a civil penalty under this chapter is not a conviction and may not be considered a conviction for any purpose.

Evidence through oral testimony must be presented at the administrative adjudication hearing. Evidence by affidavit under penalty of perjury may be presented by mail.

Sec. 9-350. - Answering a civil school bus stop arm notice of violation. 
(a)  A vehicle owner who has been issued a civil school bus stop arm notice of violation shall, either personally or through a representative, answer to the charge of the school bus stop arm violation by the date shown on the notice of violation, which date may not be earlier than the 30th day after the date the notice of violation is issued. An answer may be made in any of the following ways: 
(1)  An admission of liability with a payment of the applicable civil fine and any additional penalties and costs. 
(2)  A request to schedule an administrative adjudication hearing to either deny liability or admit liability with an explanation before a hearing officer. 
(3)  A denial of liability accompanied by an affidavit under penalty of perjury presenting evidence under Section 9-347 that the vehicle depicted in the recorded image was at the time of the school bus stop arm violation being rented, leased or test driven. 
(4)  A denial of liability accompanied by an affidavit under penalty of perjury presenting evidence under Section 9-347 that the person named in the school bus stop arm notice of violation was not the owner of the vehicle depicted in the recorded image at the time of the violation. 
(b)  Payment of the civil fine and any additional penalties and costs may be made online, in person or by mail according to the instructions on the school bus stop arm notice of violation to the address shown on the notice of violation, accompanied by payment of the amount shown on the notice of violation. Payment by mail may be made only by money order or check. Payment of the civil fine and all penalties and costs assessed under this chapter operates as a final disposition of the school bus stop arm violation charge, except when payment is made to reset a scheduled hearing as allowed under Section 9-351. 
(Ord. No. 4433, § 1, 6-6-16) 
Sec. 9-351. - Hearings for disposition of a school bus stop arm notice of violation; notice of violation and photographic recorded images as prima facie evidence. 
(a)  Every hearing for the adjudication of a school bus stop arm violation charge under this chapter must be held before a hearing officer not later than the 45th day after the department receives a request for an administrative adjudication hearing, unless otherwise agreed by the hearing officer and the person requesting a hearing. The director shall notify, in writing, the person requesting a hearing of the date, time and location of the hearing. 
(b)  A person may make a request to reset a scheduled administrative adjudication hearing. A scheduled administrative adjudication hearing may not be reset more than once unless approved by the hearing officer and then only if the vehicle owner pays to the director an amount equal to the applicable civil fine for the school bus stop arm violation with any additional penalties and costs. The director shall issue a receipt for any amounts paid under this subsection. After presentation of the receipt, all amounts paid will be refunded to the vehicle owner if the hearing officer, or a municipal court on appeal, finds that the owner is not liable for the school bus stop arm violation. 
(c)  At a hearing, the civil school bus stop arm notice of violation and the recorded images produced by the photographic school bus stop arm enforcement system are prima facie proof of the school bus stop arm violation, and the enforcement officer or other authorized person who issued the notice of violation is not required to be present unless requested by the vehicle owner charged or by the hearing officer. A vehicle owner's request to have the enforcement officer or other authorized person who issued the notice of violation, present at the hearing must be in writing and received by the hearing officer as part of the person's request for an administrative adjudication hearing. Failure to timely make this request constitutes a waiver of the vehicle owner's right to require the presence of the enforcement officer or other authorized person at the hearing. 
(d)  At a hearing, the hearing officer shall hear and consider evidence presented by the City and by the vehicle owner. The formal rules of evidence do not apply to a hearing under this chapter, and the hearing officer shall make a decision based upon a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, after giving due weight to all presumptions and prima facie evidence established by this chapter or other applicable law. 
(e)  At a hearing, the reliability of the photographic school bus stop arm enforcement system used to produce the recorded images of the school bus stop arm violation may be attested to by affidavit of an officer or employee of the City, or of the entity that installs or operates the system and is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system. An affidavit of an officer or employee of the City that alleges a school bus stop arm violation based on an inspection of the pertinent recorded images is admissible in a proceeding under this chapter, is evidence of the facts contained in the affidavit and is prima facie evidence of the violation alleged in the school bus stop arm notice of violation. 
(f)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall immediately render an order or decision, either by: 
(1)  Finding the vehicle owner liable for the school bus stop arm violation, assessing the applicable civil fine and any penalties and other costs in accordance with this chapter, and notifying the owner of the right to appeal to municipal court; or 
(2)  Finding the vehicle owner not liable for the school bus stop arm violation. 
(g)  An order of a hearing officer must be in writing, signed and dated by the hearing officer and filed with the department in a separate index and file. The order may be recorded using computer printouts, microfilm, microfiche or similar data processing techniques. 
(Ord. No. 4433, § 1, 6-6-16) 
Sec. 9-352. - Failure to answer a civil school bus stop arm notice of violation or appear at a hearing. 
(a)  The failure of a vehicle owner charged with a school bus stop arm violation to answer to the charge within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of issuance of the school bus stop arm notice of violation or to appear at any hearing, including a hearing on appeal when required to appear, is an admission of liability for the school bus stop arm violation, and the hearing officer, or the municipal court in the case of an appeal, shall issue an order of liability and assess against the owner the appropriate civil fines, penalties and other costs. 
(b)  Within seven (7) calendar days after filing an order of liability issued under this section, a hearing officer or the officer's designee shall notify the vehicle owner in writing of the order. The notice must either be hand delivered or be sent by United States mail to the address required for service of a notice of violation under Section 9-349 or to the address of the vehicle owner last known to the hearing officer. The notice must include a statement of: 
(1)  The amount of the civil fines, penalties and costs assessed; and 
(2)  The right to appeal to municipal court. 
(c)  Regardless of any other provision of this chapter, a person who receives a school bus stop arm notice of violation and who fails to timely pay the civil fine or fails to timely request an administrative adjudication hearing is still entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing if: 
(1)  The person submits to the hearing officer a written request for a hearing, accompanied by an affidavit, that attests to the date on which the person received the school bus stop arm notice of violation; and 
(2)  The written request and affidavit are submitted to the hearing officer within thirty (30) calendar days after the date the person received the school bus stop arm notice of violation. 
(Ord. No. 4433, § 1, 6-6-16) 
Sec. 9-353. - Civil fines for school bus stop arm violations; penalties and other costs. 
(a)  If a civil fine is assessed under this chapter, it must be in accordance with this section. A fine may not be waived or modified by a hearing officer or by a municipal court on appeal, when a vehicle owner is found liable for a school bus stop arm violation, except that additional penalties and other costs may be added in accordance with this section. 
(b)  The owner of a motor vehicle liable for a school bus stop arm violation shall pay a civil fine of three hundred dollars ($300.00). 
(c)  An additional twenty-five ($25.00) late payment penalty will be assessed if the vehicle owner fails to: 
(1)  Answer a school bus stop arm notice of violation within thirty (30) calendar days after its date of issuance; 
(2)  Appear at a hearing scheduled to adjudicate the school bus stop arm violation charge; or 
(3)  After being found liable, pay all civil fines, penalties, fees and costs assessed for a school bus stop arm violation within the time designated by the hearing officer or by the municipal court on appeal. 
(d)  A penalty assessed under Subsection (c) of this section may be waived by a hearing officer or by a municipal court on appeal if the vehicle owner can establish that through no fault of the owner: 
(1)  No notice of the school bus stop arm violation was received as required by this chapter; 
(2)  No notice of the hearing officer's order was received as required by this chapter; or 
(3)  Payment of the civil fine assessed for the school bus stop arm violation was not posted in a timely manner; or 
(4)  The penalty was assessed in error. 
(Ord. No. 4433, § 1, 6-6-16) 
Sec. 9-354. - Appeal from hearing. 
(a)  A vehicle owner determined by a hearing officer at an administrative adjudication hearing to be liable for a school bus stop arm violation may appeal this determination to the municipal court by filing an appeal petition, along with a filing fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00), with the municipal court clerk or a deputy clerk before the 31st calendar day after the date the hearing officer's order is entered with the department. If the hearing officer's order is reversed, the fifteen dollars ($15.00) filing fee will be returned by the City to the appellant. 
(b)  Upon receipt of an appeal petition, the municipal court clerk or deputy clerk shall schedule an appeal hearing and notify all parties of the date, time and location of the hearing. The enforcement officer or other authorized person who issued the civil school bus stop arm notice of violation is not required to be present at the appeal hearing unless requested by the vehicle owner charged. A vehicle owner's request to have the enforcement officer, or other authorized person who issued the notice of violation, present at the appeal hearing must be in writing and made as part of the appeal petition. Failure to timely make this request constitutes a waiver of the vehicle owner's right to require the presence of the enforcement officer or other authorized person at the appeal hearing. 
(c)  The appeal hearing must be a trial de novo in municipal court and is a civil proceeding. The municipal court prosecutor shall not be present at the appeal hearing. The decision of the municipal court is final. 
(d)  Service of notice of appeal under this section stays the enforcement and collection of any civil fines, penalties and costs ordered by the hearing officer. An appeal petition must be accompanied by a notarized statement in which the vehicle owner agrees to pay all civil fines, penalties and costs ordered by the hearing officer, if the person is still found liable by the municipal court upon appeal. 
(e)  At an appeal hearing, the civil school bus stop arm notice of violation and the recorded images produced by the photographic school bus stop arm enforcement system are prima facie proof of the school bus stop arm violation, and the enforcement officer or other authorized person who issued the notice of violation is not required to be present unless requested by the vehicle owner. 
(f)  At an appeal hearing, the reliability of the photographic school bus stop arm enforcement system used to produce the recorded images of the school bus stop arm violation may be attested to by affidavit of an officer or employee of the City, or of the entity that installs or operates the system and is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system. An affidavit of an officer or employee of the City that alleges a school bus stop violation based on an inspection of the pertinent recorded images is admissible in a proceeding under this chapter, is evidence of the facts contained in the affidavit and is prima facie evidence of the violation alleged in the school bus stop arm notice of violation. 
(Ord. No. 4433, § 1, 6-6-16) 
Sec. 9-355. - Effect of liability; exclusion of civil remedy; enforcement. 
(a)  The imposition of a civil fine under this chapter is not a conviction or criminal offense and may not be considered a conviction or criminal offense for any purpose. Failure to timely pay a civil fine under this chapter may not result in an arrest warrant being issued for the vehicle owner and may not be recorded on the owner's driving record. 
(b)  A civil fine may not be imposed under this chapter on the owner of a motor vehicle if the operator of the vehicle was arrested or was issued a criminal citation by a peace officer under Section 545.066 of the Texas Transportation Code, as amended, for the school bus stop arm violation recorded by the photographic school bus stop arm enforcement system. 
(c)  The City Attorney is authorized to file suit or take other action to collect any civil fines, penalties and costs assessed under this chapter. 
Sec. 9-356. - Disposition of civil fines, penalties, and costs assessed for school bus stop arm violations.

Sec. 10-169. - Maintenance of nuisance premises. 
(a)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section: 
(1)  Nuisance means the maintenance of a premises in an unhealthy, unsanitary or grossly unsightly condition as to constitute a substantial deterioration of property values in the neighborhood or render living conditions in the neighborhood unsuitable over a prolonged period. Maintenance of a premises in an unhealthy, unsanitary or grossly unsightly condition may include one (1) or more of those conditions presently prohibited elsewhere in the City Code, singly or in combination thereof or in combination with any of the conditions expressed as follows: 
a.  The storage outside of an enclosed structure of furniture other than furniture designed for outside use; 
b.  Household items including but not limited to appliances, toys, clothes, plumbing fixtures, furniture and products of a commercial trade or business enterprise, whether such items are so used or not. 
c.  Items of salvage such as scrap metal, rags, papers, bottles, cans and similar items; 
d.  Lumber and building materials not currently being used or held for immediate use upon the premises; and 
e.  Inoperable, unused or unsightly vehicles, motorized or otherwise. 
Such term shall further include a dilapidated condition of a structure, including fences, that although functional, creates an unsightly condition that substantially detracts from the appearance of the neighborhood. 
(2)  Prolonged period, absent unusual circumstances, shall generally mean thirty (30) days, but shall in no event be less than seven (7) days after notice of the existence of such condition. When a condition has existed in excess of thirty (30) days and has existed seven (7) days after notice, such fact shall be prima facie evidence that such condition has existed for a "prolonged period," but shall be rebuttable upon showing by a defendant of reasonable circumstances necessitating a greater period, such as weather conditions or the complexity or magnitude of the repairs to be made or the work to be performed to rectify a condition. 
(b)  Duty to determine. Upon becoming aware of conditions set forth herein, the official designated by the city manager shall, based upon the criteria set forth above, make a determination whether or not the conditions and circumstances constitute a nuisance and if it is determined that the conditions, if not abated, will constitute a nuisance, such official shall give notice to the owner, tenant or person in control of such premises, or an agent thereof, to remedy such condition within seven (7) days. Provided, however, that such determination shall not be binding upon the court, but the court shall determine, upon trial, the existence or nonexistence of a nuisance according to the criteria established herein. 
(c)  Duty of maintenance of private property. No person owning, leasing, occupying or having charge of any premises shall maintain or keep any nuisance thereon, nor shall any such person keep or maintain such premises in a manner causing a substantial diminution in the value of the other property in the neighborhood in which such premises are located. 
(d)  Enforcement. Enforcement of this section may be accomplished by the city in any manner authorized by law, and in addition, any person who, by reason of another's violation of any provision of this section, suffers special damage to himself different from that suffered by other property owners throughout the city generally, may bring an action to enjoin or otherwise abate an existing violation.

The application form can be obtained from the office of the City Engineer. The City Engineer uses this form, along with duplicate copies of the accompanying engineering or architectural plans, to identify those construction or renovation projects that would occur in a flood hazard area. As a minimum, the engineering or architectural plans shall show to scale: 
(1)  The nature, location, dimensions and elevations in relation to mean sea level of the area in question. 
(2)  The elevation in relation to mean sea level and the location of existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials and/or drainage facilities. 
(3)  The elevation in relation to mean sea level to which an existing non-residential structure shall be flood-proofed, the location of the foregoing. 
(4)  Any off-site facilities or conditions that may either affect on-site conditions or be affected by on-site conditions.

Section 11-149(b) identifies the information that must be submitted to the City Engineer. No floodplain alterations shall begin until a permit is issued by the City Engineer. 
    If an existing non-residential structure is proposed for flood-proofing, then a certificate sealed by a registered professional engineer in the State of Texas shall be submitted stating that all of the flood-proofing criteria listed in Section 11-207 will be met. Construction or renovation projects cannot begin until the City issues the development permit. 
(b)  Elevation certificate. Developers, owners or builders adjacent to the design floodplain, other existing creeks, swales or ditches, or other flood prone areas as designated by the City Engineer shall complete an elevation certificate prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the City. Elevation certificate forms can be obtained at the office of the City Engineer. 
(c)  Proceeding without the applicable permits. Any developer, owner or builder who fails to obtain the applicable development or other necessary permits before beginning the subject project is in violation of this article. Furthermore, any act or omission of any owner or developer of land subject to the provisions herein which has as its effect the circumventing of the intent and purpose of this article shall be considered in violation of same. In addition to the penalties outlined in Section 11-130, no building permit, plat, site plan or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any construction, reconstruction or development upon any land where such construction, reconstruction or development is not in conformity with the requirements and intent of this article. Anyone who violates any of the terms and provisions of this article shall be denied a building permit, etc., until the violation is corrected.

Sec. 11-150. - Variance and appeal procedures. 
(a)  Variances. Variances to the stormwater and flood protection ordinance shall be submitted to the City Engineer. In considering the variance request the City Engineer shall review the technical, environmental, financial, social and aesthetic merits of the variance request and shall consider the following relevant factors: 
(1)  Whether the variance request increases the potential danger to life and/or property due to drainage, flooding or erosion damage; 
(2)  Whether the variance will increase threats to public safety, create additional public expense and/or create nuisances; 
(3)  Whether the variance will conflict with state or federal laws or regulations; 
(4)  Whether the variance increases the susceptibility of the proposed or an existing facility or its contents or surrounding property to flood damage; 
(5)  Whether the variance will result in increased flood heights, create erosive velocities, increase frequency of flooding or duration of flooding or create other adverse impacts to other property owners unless the adverse impact is approved by the affected property owners and documentation of this approval in a form approved by the City Attorney and City Engineer is submitted to the City; 
(6)  Whether the variance preserves or expands natural floodplain, greenbelts and associated buffer areas of aesthetic and/or environmental value; 
(7)  Whether the variance request preserves adequate buffer distances to development and infrastructure from areas of potential flooding or erosion; 
(8)  Whether the variance will decrease floodplain valley storage; 
(9)  Whether the variance provides adequate heavy equipment access for periodic maintenance of drainage facilities and other infrastructure; 
(10)  Whether the variance request decreases the safety of access to property or facilities in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(11)  Whether there are available alternate locations for the proposed facility that would not require a variance; 
(12)  Whether the proposed facility requires a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(13)  Whether the variance is compatible with adjacent existing and proposed floodplain and drainage improvements; 
(14)  Whether the variance increases the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(15)  Whether the variance will likely increase costs of providing governmental services during and after storm events, including maintenance and repair of public infrastructure such as streets, bridges, storm sewer and channels, water, sanitary sewer, gas, electrical, telephone and other public amenities; 
(16)  Whether the variance request assists in the preservation of the historical character of structures or sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places; and 
(17)  Whether the variance requested is the minimum necessary to afford relief. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this section, the City Engineer will issue a report to the Development Review Committee summarizing his findings and recommendations for approval, approval with conditions or denial. As part of the recommendation the City Engineer may attach such conditions to the granting of the variance as deemed necessary to further the purposes of this section and the public welfare. 
    The Development Review Committee shall review the City Engineer's report, recommendations and conditions, hear other evidence or testimony as it deems pertinent and provide comments to the City Engineer. After receipt of such, the City Engineer will make a recommendation to the City Manager, or his designee, to approve the variance, approve the variance with conditions or deny the variance request. 
    The City Manager shall review the City Engineer's report, recommendations and conditions, hear other evidence or testimony as he deems pertinent and approve the variance, approve the variance with conditions or deny the variance request. The decision of the City Manager, or his designee, shall be provided in writing to the applicant requesting the variance. 
    The City Engineer shall maintain the records of all variance requests, including technical information, and shall report variances granted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon its request. 
(b)  Appeals. The decision of the City Manager may be appealed to the City Council. The City Council shall have the authority to sustain, reverse or modify the decision of the City Manager. The decision of the City Council under this section shall be final and recorded in the minutes of the City Council meeting. 
(c)  Time limits. A variance granted pursuant to this section shall expire one (1) year from the date of the granting of the variance if a permit is not approved and issued within that time and work begun.

DIVISION 3. - RUNOFF CALCULATIONS 

Sec. 11-161. - Generally. 
    The selection of which method to use for calculating runoff depends upon the size of drainage area contributing runoff at a most downstream point of a project. The "rational method" is acceptable for situations in which the drainage area is less than one hundred sixty (160) acres. A unit hydrograph method is required for situations with larger drainage areas. 
    Detention may be required by the City Engineer if existing downstream facilities are undersized or downstream cities have detention requirements. If required, the owner or developer shall assume full responsibility for maintenance of the lake or pond. This obligation shall run with the land and be a continuing obligation. 
    Runoff computations shall be based upon fully developed watershed conditions in accordance with the land use projections in the latest comprehensive land use plan for the City. The design engineer shall size drainage facilities by disregarding the detention effects of upstream property and calculating the runoff as if the off-site property was developed without any detention. If an approved regional detention/retention facility is in operation, the design engineer may size downstream drainage facilities based on consideration of the detention effects of the regional facility. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-162. - Procedure for drainage areas less than one hundred sixty (160) acres; rational method. 
    Computation of stormwater runoff for drainage areas less than one hundred sixty (160) acres shall be by the "rational method," which is based on the principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge. The formula for calculation of runoff by the "Rational Method" is: 
(Equation 1) 
Q = CIA 
Where: 
Q = The maximum rate of discharge, expressed in cubic feet per second. 
C = A runoff coefficient which varies with the topography, soil, land use and moisture content of the soil at the time the runoff producing rainfall occurs. This runoff coefficient shall be based on the ultimate use of the land as recommended by the master plan for the City of Mesquite and shall be selected from Table 1 herein on the basis of the use shown on land use and zoning map of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance for the City of Mesquite. If an area has had a change of zoning to give the area land use for which the "C" in Table 1 is higher than use shown on land use and zoning maps, the higher "C" factor shall be used. 
A = The drainage area, expressed in acres, contributing to the runoff at the point in question. Calculation of the drainage area shall be made from an accurate topographic map, a copy of which shall be submitted with the engineering plans for approval. 
I = Rainfall intensity in inches per hour for the time period that it takes for flow from the farthest point of the drainage area to reach the point of design. The rainfall intensity is found by referring to the applicable curves of Figure 1. Time of concentration or duration of rainfall for use in Figure 1 shall be calculated by velocity data shown in Table 2. 
    Time of concentration is the longest time, without interruption of flow by detention devices, that a drop of water takes to flow from the farthest point of the drainage area to the point of concentration (i.e., the point of design). The time of concentration is composed of the "inlet time" and the flow time in a conduit or channel to the point of design. Equation 2 shows how to calculate the time of concentration. 
(Equation 2) 
      L       T c  = Inlet Time + V × 60 sec/min  
Where: 
T c  = Time of concentration in minutes. 
Inlet time = Ten (10) minutes for property zoned multiple-family, churches, schools, local business, central business, commercial, or industrial 
or 
Fifteen (15) minutes for property zoned for parks, cemeteries, agricultural, and single-family residential. 
or 
      L       V × 60 sec/min  
L = Length of conduit or channel, in feet. 
V = Velocity of flow in conduit or channel, in feet per second. 
    When designing inlets and laterals, the time of concentration is simply equal to the inlet time. The design engineer will compare the above specified inlet times to the actual calculated inlet time by computing the flow time overland and along the gutter to the first inlet. The Manning equation, along with the velocity information in Table 2 (or other acceptable procedures such as the SCS method), shall be used to determine flow time to the inlet. The design engineer may use the actual calculated or specified inlet time. In no case shall a longer inlet time be used than ten (10) minutes for multiple-family, commercial, churches, schools, industrial and business areas, and fifteen (15) minutes for parks, cemeteries, agricultural and single-family areas. 
    When sizing storm sewers and channels, the time of concentration shall be calculated by adding the actual calculated inlet time (but not greater than the specified inlet times) to the flow time in the conduit and/or channel. The design engineer may use the combined times, as described, or the specified inlet times for storm sewer sizing. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-163. - Procedure for drainage areas greater than one hundred sixty (160) acres. 
    For drainage areas in excess of one hundred sixty (160) acres where the use of the "rational method" does not provide reliable results, the use of a unit hydrograph method shall be made. The use of a unit hydrograph calculation will be based upon standard and accepted engineering principles normally used in the profession subject to the approval of the City Engineer. Use the Corps of Engineers HEC-1 models for drainage areas one hundred sixty (160) acres or more. 
    The unit hydrograph method shall be based upon fully developed watershed conditions assuming no effects from the small on-site detention facilities for maintaining the rate of runoff as if the property was developed as single-family residential uses. The detention effects of large regional detention facilities can be taken into account in unit hydrograph methods. 
    Circumstances that may require the use of a unit hydrograph method include sizing open channels, reclaiming floodplains, creating lakes or building other types of drainage-related facilities on major drainage courses. Design engineers of these types of facilities should be aware that the requirement of designing for fully developed watershed conditions will mean that they will have to calculate these fully developed flows instead of using the flows calculated in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) flood insurance studies for Mesquite. FEMA's flows cannot be used because the flows are based upon existing watershed conditions. (For more information, see Division 5 on the sizing of channels and other major drainage facilities and Division 6 for floodplain alteration procedures.) Use of the rational method is allowed for design of storm sewers within the project area. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Secs. 11-164-11-170. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 4. - DESIGN OF LOCAL DRAINAGE SYSTEMS 

Sec. 11-171. - Design storm frequencies. 
    The calculations of runoff quantities that must be accommodated in drainage facilities require the selection of the design storm frequency. The design storm frequencies for various drainage structures are given below. 
Drainage Facility Design Recurrence Interval Closed storm sewer systems (required for all drainage areas less than 70 acres unless approved by the City Engineer.) 25-year with 100-year positive overflow for inlets on grade in streets such that the depth of flow in the street does not exceed the top of curb Closed storm sewer systems and inlets at street low point or sag 100-year with positive overflow for 100-year Culverts and bridges 100-year Concrete-lined channels 100-year Earthen channels 100-year Levees Standard project flood Dams above natural ground/spillways Spillway design flood varies with the class of structure (See Section 11-187)  
    The approved drainage system shall provide for positive overflow at all low points. The term "positive overflow" means that when the inlets do not function properly or when the design capacity of the conduit is exceeded, the excess flow can be conveyed overland along a grassed or paved course. Normally, this would mean along a street or alley, or shall require the dedications of special drainage easements on private property. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-172. - Street and alley capacities. 
    Street capacities shall be designed for the one-hundred-year design flood. 
    Minor arterial and lower classifications - maximum six (6) inches or top of curb. 
    Principal arterial - one (1) lane open in each direction. 
(a)  Streets. The depth of flow in the streets shall not exceed the top of curb. Figure 2 shows the capacity of streets with a straight cross slope that varies from one-eighth ( 1/8 ) inch per foot to one-half (1/2) inch per foot, which are the minimum and maximum allowable street cross slopes. 
(b)  Alleys. The flows created by the one-hundred-year storm shall be contained within the capacity of all paved alleys. Figure 3 shows the capacity of various alley sections. 
Alley capacities shall be checked at all alley turns and "T" intersections to determine if curbing is needed or grades should be flattened. Alley sections shall be super-elevated as required at corners and curves to insure that flow remains in the alley through these changes in alignment. 
Curbing shall be required for at least ten (10) feet on either side of an inlet in an alley and on the other side of the alley so that the top of the inlet is even with the high edge of the alley pavement. 
(c)  Finished floor elevations in relation to alleys, street and positive overflows. The first floor elevations of all residential and other structures shall be set at a minimum elevation of the higher of either one and one-half (1.5) feet above the alley invert or one (1) foot above the top of the street curb elevation, and with positive drainage provided away from the structure. Positive overflow sections shall provide a minimum of two (2) feet of freeboard from the overflow invert adjacent to structures and the corresponding first floor elevation of all residential and other structures. Lot grading plans are required for all new subdivisions. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-173. - Placement of inlets. 
    Storm sewer inlets shall be built along paved streets at such intervals that the depth of flow, based upon the one-hundred-year storm, does not exceed the top of curb. Inlets shall be located as necessary to remove the flow based on a twenty-five-year storm. If in the opinion of the City Engineer the flow in the gutters would be excessive using the above design criteria, the storm sewers or inlet locations could be altered to relieve adverse conditions. 
    Inlets shall be placed upstream from an intersection whenever possible. At any intersection, only one (1) street shall be crossed with surface drainage and this street shall be the lower classified street. When an alley intersects a street, inlets shall be placed in the alley whenever flow down that alley would cause the capacity of the intersecting street to be exceeded. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-174. - Inlet capacities and sizes. 
    Figure 4 shows the various types of inlets allowed for use along various kinds of streets. Other types of inlets may be used upon the approval of those inlets by the City Engineer. The minimum inlet size shall be eight (8) feet. Figures 5 through 18 show how to determine the capacity of inlets. No more than twenty (20) feet of inlets shall be placed along one (1) gutter at any given location. Grate or combination inlets shall not be used in city maintained streets unless approved by the City Engineer. 
    Minimum sizes of laterals shall be eighteen (18) inches for use with eight-foot inlets, and twenty-one-inch laterals with ten-foot, fourteen-foot and drop inlets, and twenty-four-inch laterals for twenty-foot inlets. Where laterals tie into trunk lines, place the laterals on a sixty-degree angle with the trunk line and connect them so that the longitudinal centers intersect. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-175. - Pipe design standards. 
(a)  The Manning Equation. Storm sewer conduit shall be sized to flow full. Manning's Equation shall be used to determine the conduit size. Manning's Equation is expressed as: 
(Equation 3) 
1.486 1.486 Q = _____(A)(R) 2/3 (S) 1/2 or V = _____(R) 2/3 (S) 1/2 n n  
Where: 
Q = Flow in cubic feet per second. 
V = Velocity of flow in conduit in feet per second. 
A = Cross-sectional area of the conduit in square feet. 
R = Hydraulic radius of the conduit, which is the area of flow divided by the wetted perimeter (R = A/P). 
S = Slope of the hydraulic gradient. 
n = Roughness coefficient of the conduit. 
P = Wetted perimeter. 
Figure 19 is a graphical solution of Manning's Equation, which allows sizing of concrete pipe, assuming an "n" value of 0.013. 
(b)  Minimum and maximum velocities in pipes. The minimum velocities in conduit shall be two and one-half (2.5) feet per second. The minimum slopes for various pipe sizes that will maintain this minimum velocity are given in Table 3. The recommended maximum velocities of flow in the conduit and channels are given in Table 4. 
    The maximum discharge velocities in the pipe shall also not exceed the permitted velocity of the receiving channel or conduit at the outfall to prevent erosive conditions, as shown in Table 4. The maximum outfall velocity of a conduit in partial flow shall be computed for partial depth and shall not exceed the maximum permissible velocity of the receiving channel unless controlled by an appropriate energy dissipater (e.g. stilling basins, impact basins, riprap protection). 
(c)  Roughness coefficients for conduits. In general, stormwater shall be carried in concrete pipe conduit, but other types of conduit can be used to carry stormwater. However, prior permission to use metal conduit must be obtained from the City Engineer. Table 5 shows recommended roughness coefficients for various types of conduits. If, in the opinion of the design engineer, other values for the roughness coefficient should be used, the different value can be used with the permission of the City Engineer. Appropriate notes of the approved roughness coefficient shall then be shown on the engineering plans. 
(d)  Hydraulic gradient of conduits. Conduits must be sized and slopes must be set such that runoff flows smoothly down the drainage system. To insure this smooth passage, the hydraulic gradient must be at the proper elevations. 
    The proper starting elevation of the hydraulic gradient shall be set according to the applicable criteria listed below: 
(1)  When a proposed conduit is to connect to an existing storm sewer, the hydraulic gradient of the proposed storm sewer should start at the elevation of the hydraulic gradient of the existing storm sewer based on an evaluation of the existing storm sewer with respect to the requirements found in this article. This criterion will be used for existing systems whether or not they are designed in accordance with this article. 
(2)  When a proposed conduit enters an open channel, creek or flood control sumps, the hydraulic gradient of the proposed conduit should start at the twenty-five-year water surface elevation of the channel or creek when the ratio of the drainage area of the receiving creek (at the development) to the development area is fifteen (15) or greater. For ratios of less than fifteen (15), the one-hundred-year water surface will be used on the receiving creek. 
    Not only is it important to use the proper starting elevation for the hydraulic gradient, but proper hydraulic gradient elevations must be maintained for the length of the conduit. The inside top of the conduit should be at or below the hydraulic gradient. However, effort should be made to keep the top of the pipe as close to the hydraulic gradient as possible so that deep excavations to lay pipe are not required. 
    When the conduit is flowing partially full, the hydraulic gradient shall be shown at the inside crown of the conduit. 
    The hydraulic gradient shall be kept two (2) feet below the top of curb. If this cannot be obtained, the hydraulic gradient shall be at least 1.5 V 1 2 / 2g feet below the gutter line, where V 1 is the velocity in the lateral. 
(e)  Minor head losses. When establishing the hydraulic gradient of a storm sewer, minor head losses at points of turbulence shall be calculated and included in the computation of the hydraulic gradient. 
    Entrance losses. Entrance losses to a closed storm sewer system from an open channel or lake shall be calculated using Equation 4. 
(Equation 4) 
V 1 2 H L = K e _____2g  
Where: 
H L  = Head loss in feet. 
V 1  = Velocity in the downstream pipe in feet per second. 
K e  = Head loss coefficient (see Table 6). 
The resulting hydraulic gradeline shall be compared to inlet control conditions for the storm sewer as described in Section 11-176. The higher of the two (2) values will be used as the controlling upstream hydraulic grade line. 
    Expansion losses. For pipe size expansions, head loss shall be calculated using the following equations: 
(Equation 5) 
D 1 V 1 2 H L = (1 - ( _____ ) 2 ) 2 _____ D 2 2g  
Where: 
H L  = Head loss in feet. 
V 1  = Upstream velocity in feet per second. 
D 1  = Upstream pipe diameter. 
D 2  = Downstream pipe diameter. 
    Manhole and bend losses. Head losses associated with manholes for pipe direction changes and bends in pipes of equal diameter shall be calculated using: 
(Equation 6) 
V 2 2 H L = K;sub\sub; _____2g  
Where: 
H L  = Head loss in feet. 
V 2 = Velocity in the downstream pipe in feet per second. 
K;sub\sub; = Head loss coefficient from Table 7. 
    Junction losses. Head losses associated with wye connections or manholes with branch laterals entering the main line can be calculated by using Equation 7. 
(Equation 7) 
V 2 2 V 1 2 H L = _____ - Kj _____2g 2g  
Where: 
H L  = Head loss in feet. 
V 1  = Velocity in the upstream pipe in feet per second. 
V 2  = Velocity in the downstream pipe in feet per second. 
K j  = Head loss coefficient from Table 7. 
(f)  Storm sewer laterals. Laterals for storm sewer systems shall be sized to control the flooding depth at the inlets. The depth shall not exceed the limits previously established for storm sewer systems. Calculation of the flooding depth shall be determined based on the addition of the velocity head of the lateral to the computed HGL: 
ELEV = HGL + V L 2 _____2g  
    This calculated elevation shall be compared to the elevation determined based on inlet control nomographs as developed by the department of transportation. The highest of the two (2) elevations shall be used to establish the capacity of laterals and the corresponding depth of flooding. 
(g)  Outfalls to open channels and lakes. The flow lines of storm sewer conduits that discharge into open channels shall match the flow line of the channel. One (1) exception to this requirement of matching the flow line is when a storm sewer discharges into a concrete-lined channel or when the outfall is submerged below the normal water surface of a lake. In the case of a pipe discharging to a lined channel, the outlet must be below the top of the channel lining. The second exception pertains to storm sewer discharge that must cross wide floodplain areas. Under this condition, the storm sewer could discharge into a lined ditch which would convey runoff to the flow line of the channel without creating an erosive condition. Permissible velocities within the ditch will be based on the type of lining used and the velocities provided in Table 4. Flumes to bring the discharge down to the flow line of earthen creeks shall not be permitted. Drop structures shall be allowed upon written approval of the City Engineer. 
    The velocity at the discharge end of the conduit shall be computed based on partial flow depth and shall be sufficiently low so as to not cause downstream erosion problems. Table 4 shows the maximum velocities allowed in various types of channels, which are then the maximum discharge velocities at storm sewer outfalls. 
    In some circumstances, the configuration of the storm sewer in relation to the flow line of the creek may cause excessive velocities to be reached unless provisions are made to slow the velocity. One (1) recommended method of slowing the velocity is to have the last length of pipe (a length of at least ten (10) times the diameter) be on a slope that will reduce the partial flow outlet velocity to the values shown in Table 4 for the receiving stream. Stilling basins shall also be allowed to reduce discharge velocities. 
    The discharge pipe shall also intersect minor creeks at an angle not to exceed sixty (60) degrees. Minor creeks are defined as those creeks, channels or drainageways where the distance from the pipe outlet to the opposite creek bank at the bottom of the channel is twenty (20) feet or less. Pipes may intersect major creeks (greater than twenty (20) feet to opposite bank) at a ninety-degree angle. The City Engineer may require that pipes intersect major creeks at an angle not to exceed sixty (60) degrees, when a ninety-degree angle would result in an erosive condition. 
    Figure 20 shows how a storm sewer should be configured to discharge into a creek. 
(h)  Easements for enclosed storm sewers and positive overflow areas. All storm sewer conduits to be dedicated to the City of Mesquite shall be located in an easement dedicated to the City of Mesquite at the time of final platting of the property. The easement shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wide for storm sewers or wider if the City Engineer requires it for maintenance or other purposes. Special drainage easements on private property shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet wide or wider if the City Engineer requires it for maintenance or other purposes. Maintenance responsibility shall be as required in Section 11-186(e). No fences, buildings or other structures and improvements shall be placed within these dedicated easements. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-176. - Culvert design standards. 
    Culverts shall be in accordance with the Texas Highway Department Hydraulic Manual, Chapter 4 - Culverts. The calculation of hydraulic grade lines will consider both inlet and outlet control for the culvert. Starting water surface elevations for gradeline calculation will be the same as required for storm sewers. See Section 11-175.

Secs. 11-177-11-185. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 5. - SPECIAL DRAINAGE FACILITIES 

Sec. 11-186. - Channels. 
(a)  Channel design. Open channels may be used instead of enclosed systems when the drainage area of contributing flow to the channel is greater than one hundred sixty (160) acres. Open channels shall not be permitted when the drainage area is less than one hundred sixty (160) acres. Table 4 shows the maximum velocities allowed for certain types of channels. Roughness coefficients for the design of open channels are provided in Table 8. The following criteria shall be used in determining the nature of the open channel. 
    For channels with a contributing drainage area of one hundred sixty (160) acres or greater: 
(1)  Channels may be left in their natural state provided that the channel velocities are six (6) feet per second or less, if approved by the City Engineer. Otherwise, all channels shall be in accordance with subsection (a)(4) or fully lined. 
(2)  If the natural channel is to be replaced by an improved channel, the flow from the one-hundred-year design flood must be contained within the improved channel while allowing for one (1) foot of freeboard. An improved channel shall meet the floodplain alteration regulations presented in Division 6. 
(3)  Improved channels shall include a lined section if the design velocity is greater than six (6) feet per second. Lining types such as concrete and rock walls may be used upon approval of the City Engineer. Improved channels with design velocities of less than the permissible velocities shown in Table 11 may be earthen if the channels are revegetated properly. 
(4)  For lined channels, all of the channel bottom and at least the first three (3) feet (vertical height) of the side slopes up from the channel bottom shall be lined, unless approved by the City Engineer. 
(5)  Earthen sides above the lined section or totally earthen channels shall be on at least a four (4) horizontal to one (1) vertical slopes and shall have approved ground cover to prevent erosion. 
(6)  Unless shown to be feasible in a soils report sealed by a registered professional engineer in the State of Texas, and approved by the City Engineer, improved channels shall have minimum side slopes of: 
a.  Four (4) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical for earthen grassed side slopes. 
b.  Two (2) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical for side slopes in rock. 
(7)  The developer or owner shall use low maintenance vegetation for vegetative cover, as approved by the City Engineer prior to planting. The selection of materials shall comply with either the current ground cover listing for North Central Texas furnished through the Texas Agricultural Extension Service or Table 9 in this article. 
(8)  The developer/owner shall provide a drainage easement and a required maintenance easement (see paragraph (d) below) which shall be dedicated to the City of Mesquite as a permanent drainage right-of-way and open space corridor. 
(9)  Channel improvement shall not include concrete pilot channels which do not meet the requirements of subsection (a)(4), unless approved by the City Engineer. 
(b)  Erosion prevention. All channel sections must consider and account for channel stabilization in their design. This requirement pertains to all sections whether they are left in their natural condition or are modified in any manner. Three (3) sets of requirements are provided depending upon the relationship of the existing channel to the limits of the developer/owner's property boundaries. The City Engineer shall have the discretion to require the implementation of the portion of these requirements as deemed necessary, depending on the specifics of the property being developed or improved or to allow the escrow of funds sufficient to provide for the construction of a proportionate amount of channel improvements in lieu of actual construction. This discretion may be exercised when a small section of improvements is not deemed by the City Engineer to be economically practicable. 
(1)  In cases where the entire channel section is contained within the limits of the developer/owner property boundaries, the developer/owner shall: 
a.  Provide for an improved stabilized channel cross-section which reduces all velocities to six (6) fps or below for vegetated channels. The channel improvements must meet all requirements of this article. 
b.  For vegetated channel sections with channel velocities ranging from six (6) to eight (8) fps, construct grade control structures within the channel and overbank areas to prevent erosion. Grade control structures shall have a minimum effective depth of three (3) feet below existing or proposed grades with an adequate number of structures to prevent less than one (1) foot of degradation. 
(2)  In cases where the property boundary follows the centerline of the channel or incorporates only a portion of the channel cross-section, the developer/owner shall: 
a.  Determine the design section required to provide for an improved stabilized channel cross-section which reduces all velocities to six (6) fps or below for vegetated channels. The design channel section must meet all requirements of this article. 
b.  The design section may include vegetated channel sections with channel velocities ranging from six (6) to eight (8) fps, provided that grade control structures are included within the channel and overbank areas to prevent erosion. Grade control structures shall have a minimum effective depth of three (3) feet below existing or proposed grades with an adequate number of structures to prevent less than one (1) foot of degradation. 
c.  The developer/owner shall construct or escrow funds for construction of the portion of the design improvements required on their property for the ultimate channel design. The City Engineer shall have the discretion to determine the portion of the design improvements to be constructed/escrowed by the developer/owner. In most instances, the developer/owner shall construct one-half (1/2) of the improvements on their property. 
d.  If grade control structures are incorporated into the design, the developer/owner shall coordinate with adjacent owners in order to construct these features in their entirety at the time of the initial portion of the channel improvements. 
e.  The developer/owner shall provide for a drainage easement and access/ maintenance easement consistent with the portion of the improvements provided. 
(3)  In cases where the developer/owner owns property adjacent to channel or floodplain areas but does not own a portion of the channel or floodplain area, the developer/owner shall (at the discretion of the City Engineer): 
a.  Determine the channel improvement configuration necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (b)(1) above; and 
b.  Shall provide a dedicated easement to the City for the portion of this future improvement configuration, including necessary maintenance and access easement, which will include the developer/owner property. 
(c)  Starting water surface condition. When performing hydraulic analyses for channel or drainageway design, the starting water surface shall be based on the following criteria: 
(1)  When the ratio of the drainage area of the receiving creek (at the confluence location) to the drainage area of the channel or drainageway being designed is fifteen (15) or greater, the ten-year water surface of the receiving creek shall be used as the starting water surface for hydraulic design calculations. For creeks where the ten-year water surface is not available, the slope-area method will be used for starting design calculations. 
(2)  When the ratio of the drainage area is less than fifteen (15), the one-hundred-year elevation on the receiving creek shall be used as the starting water surface for design calculations. 
(d)  Easements required for open channels. Drainage and/or floodway easements for all open channels, creeks and flumes shall be dedicated to the City of Mesquite. Easements shall encompass all areas having a ground elevation below the higher of one (1) foot above the water surface elevation associated with the design flood or the top of the high bank or channel edge. No fences, buildings or other structures which could impede flow shall be placed within this dedicated drainage easement. In all cases, the easement shall also include at least a fifteen-foot wide maintenance strip along both sides of the channel or, if the City Engineer so allows, at least a twenty-foot wide maintenance strip along one (1) side of the channel. Streets, alleys, bike paths, etc., alongside the channel can serve as all or part of the maintenance easement. 
    Drainage easements for flumes shall be located with sufficient width to permit future maintenance accessibility, and in no case shall be less than fifteen (15) feet wide. 
(e)  Maintenance of facilities and easements. All drainage easements shall be dedicated to the City of Mesquite. The maintenance responsibility of the easements will vary based on the situation. The following outlines the maintenance responsibility for various conditions. 
(1)  Drainage improvements constructed by the City of Mesquite shall be the maintenance responsibility of the City. 
(2)  Drainage improvements constructed in single-family residential areas, where no homeowner's association or other similar association has been formed, shall be the maintenance responsibility of the City of Mesquite. 
(3)  Drainage improvements shall not be the maintenance responsibility of the City of Mesquite when constructed in: 
a.  Residential areas where a homeowner's association or other similar association is formed; or 
b.  Areas of commercial or industrial zoning. 
    The maintenance activities in these areas shall be the responsibility of private ownership including associations. If such improvement deteriorates in condition, the City Manager or his designated representative shall notify such property owner or association of required corrections and/or maintenance to bring drainage facility up to the standards as originally approved by the City and according to the original improvement. If such maintenance is not accomplished within a reasonable time, then the City may contract for such work and levy an assessment to the property owner or association for such cost. 
    Perpetual maintenance must be assured by a homeowner's association (single family only), trust fund or other private entity as specified by the City Council. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-187. - Lakes and dams. 
    In the event that a property owner or developer desires to modify an existing pond or lake or desires to impound stormwater by filling or constructing an above-ground dam, thereby creating a lake, pond, lagoon or basin as part of the planned development of that property, the criteria listed below shall be met before city approval of the impoundment can be given. Ponds or lakes created by excavation of a channel area without erecting a dam above natural ground elevation or instream, low water checkdams are also subject to the criteria listed below, with the exception of spillway capacity requirements. The City Engineer has the final authority to determine the design criteria for a proposed dam, check dam or excavated lake. The requirements of the State of Texas must also be met for the construction of dams, lakes and other impoundments. 
_____
    The design criteria for a dam is dependent on the size and hazard classification of the dam. The size and hazard classification will be based on Chapter 12 of the Texas Water Code and will be determined by the City Engineer based on information furnished by the owner. The following criteria will be used to classify a dam: 
(1)  Size. The classification for size is based on the height of the dam and storage capacity, whichever gives the larger size category. Height is defined as the distance between the top of the dam (minus the freeboard) and the existing streambed at the downstream toe. Storage is defined as the maximum water volume impounded at the top of the dam (minus the freeboard). 
Size Classification 
Impoundment 
Category Storage (acre-feet) Height (feet) Minor <100 <10 Small =100 and <1,000 =10 and <40 Intermediate =1,000 and <50,000 =40 and <100 Large =50,000 =100  
(2)  Hazard potential. The hazard potential for a dam is based on the potential for loss of human life and property damage downstream from a dam in the event of failure. The following categories will be used: 
Hazard Potential Classification 
Category Loss of Life 
(Extent of Development) Economic Loss 
(Extent of Development) Low None expected (No permanent structures for human habitation) Minimal (Undeveloped to occasional structures or agriculture) Significant Possible, but not expected (No urban developments and no more than a small number of inhabitable structures) Appreciable (notable agricultural, industry or commercial development) High Expected (Urban development or large number of inhabitable structures) Excessive (Extensive public, industrial or agricultural development)  
(3)  Spillway design flood. The classification of a dam based on the above criteria will be used to determine the spillway design flood (SDF). The total capacity of a dam structure, including principal and emergency spillways, shall be adequate to pass the SDF without exceeding the top dam elevation at a minimum. The SDFs for various dam classifications are as follows: 
Spillway Design Flood 
Hazard Size SDF Low Minor 100-year Small 1/4 PMF Intermediate 1/4 PMF to 1/2 PMF Large PMF Significant Small 1/4 PMF to 1/2 PMF Intermediate 1/2 PMF to PMF Large PMF High Small PMF Intermediate PMF Large PMF  
    In all cases, the minimum principal spillway design capacity is the one-hundred-year design flood. In certain cases, a dam breach analysis may be required to determine the proper classification of the structure. For all structures requiring a spillway design flood equal to the PMF, a dam breach analysis is required to determine the downstream consequences of a failure. All dams designed for a SDF of 1/2 PME or less shall be constructed with a minimum freeboard of two (2) feet above the SDF elevation. 
_____ 
(4)  Additional design requirements. 
a.  An engineering plan for such construction, accompanied by complete drainage design information and sealed by a registered professional engineer, shall have been approved by the City of Mesquite; 
b.  The spillway and any emergency overflow areas shall be located so that flood waters will not inundate any buildings, roadways or other structures. 
c.  All federal, state and county laws pertaining to impoundment of surface water shall have been complied with, including the design construction and safety of the impounding structure. Copies of any federal, state and county permits issued for the proposed impoundments shall be submitted to the City Engineer. 
d.  Any existing structure, which is included in the project area, shall be improved to comply with the applicable federal, state, county and city safety requirements for structures. 
e.  Before removing, enlarging or altering any existing lake, the owner will furnish a study of the effects of the alteration upon flooding conditions both upstream and downstream. The study shall be prepared by a professional engineer and submitted to the City for approval prior to making the proposed alteration. Compensatory storage shall be provided in some manner such that equal or comparable flood retention capacity is maintained. 
f.  Any improvements to existing dams or lakes or construction of new impoundments shall be made at the expense of the developer, prior to acceptance of the adjacent street, utilities and drainage improvements as provided for under the subdivision ordinance. 
(5)  Maintenance and liability criteria. 
a.  The owner or developer shall have agreed to retain private ownership of the lake, pond or lagoon, or basin constructed and to assume full responsibility for the protection of the general public from any health or safety hazards related to the lake, pond or lagoon constructed. 
b.  The owner or developer shall have agreed to assume full responsibility for the maintenance of the lake, pond or lagoon, or basin constructed. The owner or developer shall keep the City Engineer advised of the current responsible agent for this maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-188. - Levees. 
    In the event that developers or owners wish to build levees to protect an area from flooding, applicable FEMA and State of Texas guidelines and the following criteria apply: 
(1)  Levees shall be designed to have four (4) feet of freeboard above the standard project flood for the fully developed watershed flows. 
(2)  Levees shall be designed according to the Corps of Engineers design criteria whether or not they are federally authorized levees. 
(3)  Levee systems shall be designed with interior drainage systems to prevent flooding from local runoff contained within the system for the one-hundred-year design flood. 
(4)  Levee systems shall have written operation procedures that address gate closure conditions and emergency warning plan. A copy of these procedures shall be furnished to the City Engineer. 
(5)  Automated gate closure systems shall have power from two (2) independent sources and shall be capable of being operated manually. 
(6)  Ring levees protecting individual structures proposed for construction after the enactment date of this article shall not be permitted. 
(7)  All new levee systems shall have permanent positive closures to the required design elevation. Temporary closures involving sandbagging or other procedures requiring manual operations shall not be permitted. 
(8)  Provisions shall be made for ensuring the permanent maintenance of levees either by a flood control district or similar governmental organization or by the existing property owner and all future owners, heirs or assigns. 
(9)  Additional plan requirements include water surface profiles for the design flood and SPF; top of levee profile, definition of interior drainage facilities, including pump station and ponding areas; location of gravity outlets, gatewells and closure structures; and elevation-duration data on the receiving system. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-189. - Detention and retention facilities. 
    As previously described in Division 3 of this article, the City Engineer may require that runoff rates for all land uses be limited to the rates that would be produced from single-family residential areas. This requirement may also apply to the development of sites as churches, schools and other institutional uses. Detention/retention facilities to reduce runoff rates will be provided within approved levee districts unless the district can demonstrate, with technical data, that adequate detention/retention storage is provided in dedicated sumps and storage areas to offset the impacts of developments to runoff rates equal to a single-family residential rate. Detention/retention facilities shall be designed for the one-hundred-year design flood according to the following criteria: 
(1)  The minimum amount of storage volume of the detention basin shall be that volume required to reduce runoff rate to a single-family rate. Dedicated detention/retention basins shall also include an additional one (1) foot of freeboard and two (2) feet of sediment storage. The volume of runoff storage for drainage areas greater than one hundred sixty (160) acres shall be computed using unit hydrograph procedures. Snyder's Unit Hydrograph will be utilized for all computations. Manual methods or use of the computer program HEC-1 are allowed for runoff hydrograph computation and flood routings. 
For drainage areas less than one hundred sixty (160) acres, the above methods are recommended; however, an approximate routing method based on the rational formula is allowable, as outlined in Figure 21. 
(2)  Detention areas in parking lots shall not be: 
a.  In required parking spaces but in extra spaces. 
b.  Behind speed bumps unless the speed bumps are made with reinforced concrete. 
c.  Deeper than six (6) inches unless warning signs are posted. 
(3)  Drainage easements shall be provided for all regional detention/retention facilities and for other detention/retention facilities where two (2) or more owners are involved. 
(4)  Detention/retention facilities shall be designed to empty in less than twenty-four (24) hours unless it is also serving as an erosion control facility. 
(5)  Detention/retention facilities shall not be counted as an erosion control technique unless (1) the basins are designed to empty a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours from the storm event and (2) adequate sediment storage areas in the basin have been set aside and are maintained. Other municipal ordinances give additional details as to how to design multi-purpose detention/retention facilities. 
(6)  Detention/retention facilities shall be maintained by the owner unless the facilities are dedicated to and accepted by the City of Mesquite. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-190. - Flumes. 
    The use of flumes is not recommended for widespread use. Flumes shall not be permitted when the purpose of a permanent flume is to carry runoff down the sides of earthen channels. A flume may be used to direct overflow runoff along property lines until the runoff can be intercepted by streets or conduit flows. Flumes crossing sidewalks shall be covered or bridged such as to minimize danger to pedestrians. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-191. - Connections from buildings to storm sewers. 
    Drainage from residential areas, such as roof tops, should be allowed to flow overland before joining the storm sewer system. 
    Seepage into basements or sub-surface structures that is pumped to ground level, seepage from springs and runoff from roof drains on non-residential buildings that would flow onto or across driveways, sidewalks or other areas commonly crossed by pedestrians can create hazards or nuisances to pedestrians. Thus, if hazards or nuisances would be created, the basement and rooftop drains shall be tied directly to the nearest storm sewer, provided that pumped lines from basements have back flow preventers and the water is uncontaminated. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Secs. 11-192-11-205. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 6. - FLOODPLAIN GUIDELINES 

Sec. 11-206. - Lands to which this article applies. 
    A person shall comply with the requirements of this article for floodplain areas before making substantial improvements to or increasing the outside dimensions of an existing structure or developing land within the design flood line of a creek or stream having a contributing drainage area of twenty-four (24) acres or more, whether or not the land has been formally designated as a floodplain. Floodplain areas shall also include all areas inundated by the design flood and shown as areas of special flood hazard on the flood insurance study's maps. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-207. - General floodplain regulations. 
(a)  Permitted uses of floodplain areas. To minimize possible losses of life and property, the following uses are permitted in a floodplain area provided they are also permitted in the underlying zoning district: 
(1)  Farm or ranch; 
(2)  Local utilities, electrical substation, water reservoir or pumping station, and water treatment plant; 
(3)  Public park or playground, private recreation club or area, private community center and golf course; 
(4)  Outside commercial amusement approved by a specific use permit; 
(5)  Helistop approved by a specific use permit; and 
(6)  Radio, television or microwave tower, and amateur communications tower with a special use permit. 
    Structures customarily associated with the above uses may be constructed within a floodplain area only if the proposed structure meets the same engineering requirements applicable to filling in a floodplain (See Section 11-208). 
    Open private recreation clubs or areas and private community centers, without exterior walls which would incur structural damage during flood conditions, are permitted in floodplain areas. Private facilities listed above, with enclosed walls that would incur damage, are not permitted in floodplain areas. 
    Uses and structures other than those mentioned above shall not be permitted in floodplain areas. 
    Notwithstanding the previous provisions of this section, the City will seek to preserve the one-hundred-year floodplain for the following stream and creek segments: 
(1)  Stream 2B7 south of Town East Boulevard to its confluence with South Mesquite Creek. 
(2)  The West Fork of South Mesquite Creek south of U.S. 80 to its confluence with South Mesquite Creek. 
(3)  South Mesquite Creek from North Mesquite Drive to the East Fork of the Trinity River. 
(4)  North Mesquite Creek from U.S. 80 to its confluence with the East Fork of the Trinity River. 
(5)  The East Fork of the Trinity River within the City. 
    Plans for encroachment and/or improvement of the floodplain in the five (5) stream and creek segments identified above shall be submitted for review to the City Engineer, the City Planner and the Director of Parks and Recreation. The City Engineer will comment on the effects of the proposed encroachments and/or improvements on floodwater elevations and on the hydraulic adequacy of the channel. The City Planner may comment on the advisability of the zoning and land use. The Director of Parks and Recreation will comment on the use of the land for parks and open space as well as bird and wildlife habitat. The one-hundred-year floodplain may not be developed in the stream and creek segments identified above without staff and City Council review of the ramifications of such development. 
(b)  Residential construction. New construction in reclaimed floodplain areas and "substantial improvements" of any existing residential structure in floodplain areas shall have the lowest floor, including basements or fully enclosed areas of any new or "substantial improvement" construction, elevated to at least two (2) feet above the design flood elevation. Fill elevations shall be one (1) foot above the elevation of the design flood. Incremental improvements, either at one (1) time or over a period of time, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value at the time of the first improvement, shall be considered as a "substantial improvement." New residential structures or "substantial improvements" on stilts or behind ring levees serving individual lots shall not be permitted. 
    Improvements to an existing structure that increase the outside dimensions, but do not result in a "substantial improvement," must meet the requirements of Section 11-208. 
    Table 10 presents a synopsis of the requirements for residential construction in floodplain areas. 
(c)  Non-residential construction. New construction in reclaimed floodplain areas and "substantial improvement" of any existing commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure in floodplain areas shall either have the lowest floor, including basements of any new or "substantial improvement" construction, elevated to at least two (2) feet above the design flood elevation, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
(1)  Be flood-proofed so that below two (2) feet above the design flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

    Table 10 overviews the requirements for placing manufactured homes in flood hazard areas. 
(e)  Recreation vehicles. Recreational vehicles located on a site within a designated floodplain area shall (i) be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days and (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" outlined in this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(f)  Streets, parking lots and bridges The top of curb of all new streets to be built in reclaimed floodplain areas shall be at least two (2) feet above the design flood elevation. The low beam of all new bridges to be constructed across floodplains shall be a minimum of two (2) feet above the design flood elevation. All new private bridges to individual homes shall have their low beams at two (2) feet above the design flood elevation. Parking lots associated with residential, commercial and industrial uses in reclaimed floodplain areas shall be at least at the design flood elevation. Parking lots for public parks or playgrounds, private recreation club or area, private community center and golf courses may be located below the design flood elevation. 
(g)  Utilities. All new and replacement water supply systems, sanitary sewer facilities and other public utilities shall be designed to minimize or eliminate flood damage and infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
(h)  Fences. Fences (private and public screening) shall be constructed such that blockage of surface water flow does not occur. Fences shall not be allowed in floodplain area or within dedicated easements. This includes the requirement that erosive conditions shall not be created around, under or near a fence structure. 
(i)  Additional construction standards for structures. All improvements and construction permitted in a floodplain area must comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Structures must be securely anchored to the foundation to prevent flotation and collapse during inundation and designed to prevent damage to nonstructural elements during inundation.

(9)  Basement ceilings for non-residential structures must be of sufficient wet strength and be so installed as to survive inundation. 
(10)  Paints or other finishes used at or below the lowest floor elevation must be capable of surviving inundation. 
(11)  All air ducts, large pipes and storage tanks located at or below the lowest floor elevation must be firmly anchored to prevent flotation. 
(12)  Tanks must be vented at a location above the design flood elevation. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-208. - Floodplain alterations. 
    As stated previously in Section 11-207, no new construction is allowed in floodplain areas, but construction is allowed in those areas that can be reclaimed from the floodplain. The City of Mesquite has adopted a "natural floodway" that differs from the "regulatory floodway" established by FEMA. The "natural floodway" consists of the natural channel and floodplain that is effective in conveying the design flood. Areas of ineffective flow around bridges, topographic constrictions and other constrictions are excluded from the "natural floodway." The effective flow area and limits of the "natural floodway" are determined using 4:1 flow expansions downstream of constrictions and 1:1 flow expansions upstream of constrictions. Figure 22 displays an example of effective flow areas at a typical bridge location. 
    A development permit for floodplain reclamation or other types of alterations shall be allowed only if all of the following criteria are met: 
(1)  Alterations of the floodplain and "natural floodway" shall not increase the water surface elevation of the design flood nor increase the volume of water to any adjacent, adjoining, upstream or downstream property owner, or otherwise adversely affect the property of any adjacent, adjoining, upstream or downstream property owner unless: 
a.  Full disclosure of the effects of the increase is made to the City; 
b.  Full disclosure of the effects of the increase is made to all property owners, governmental agencies and quasi-governmental agencies affected by such increase; and 
c.  The applicant provides evidence to the City, in a form acceptable to the City, that the applicant has acquired legal right (capable of being assigned to the City) to encroach upon the affected property which right shall take into consideration the effect of such encroachment on the remaining property of the affected owners. 
d.  Applicant's delivery to the City of policies of insurance in amounts and containing terms agreeable to the City and which name the City as a named insured or as an additional insured, insuring City against claims by third parties arising as a result of claims which may be made by adjacent, adjoining, upstream or downstream property owners for damages occasioned, or claimed to be occasioned, as a result of flooding due to development of the property or construction of any improvements upon the property. 
e.  Applicant's delivery to the City of a legally enforceable and binding indemnity agreement containing terms agreeable to the City, indemnifying the City from and against all loss or liability (including attorney's fees) which may be occasioned by the City as a result of claims by third parties arising as a result of claims which may be made by adjacent, adjoining, upstream or downstream property owners for damages occasioned, or claimed to be occasioned, as a result of flooding due to development of the property or construction of any improvements upon the property. 
It shall be the duty and obligation of the applicant to show and establish that there will not be an increase of surface elevation, volume or velocity, or alternatively the extent of the amount of such increase together with the full disclosure of all property affected by such increase. The matters herein required shall be evidenced by submission of drainage plans in form and content satisfactory to the City under seal of a professional registered engineer in the state. The cost of preparation of such drainage plans shall be paid exclusively by the applicant. The matters required by this paragraph shall be reviewed by an outside consultant of the City's choosing. The cost incurred by the City as a result of outside consultant review shall be paid by the applicant. 
(2)  Alterations shall be in compliance with FEMA guidelines. All projects shall receive a conditional letter of map revision prior to issuance of a development permit. 
(3)  Alterations of the floodplain shall not create an erosive water velocity on- or off-site. 
(4)  The effects of existing improvements or public and private improvements for which a future commitment has been made by the City, county, state or federal agencies shall be used in determining water surface elevations and velocities. 
(5)  Any alteration of floodplain areas shall not cause any additional expense in any current or projected public improvements. 
(6)  The floodplain shall be altered only to the extent permitted by equal conveyance on both sides of the natural channel. The right of equal conveyance applies to all owners and uses including greenbelt, park areas and recreational usages. Owners may relinquish their right to equal conveyance by providing a written agreement to the City. 
(7)  Maximum slopes of filled areas shall not exceed three (3) to one (1). Slopes of any excavated areas not in rock shall not exceed four (4) to one (1). 
Fill slopes, vertical walls, terracing and other slope treatments may be considered provided no unbalancing of stream flow results and only as a part of a grading permit application. 
(8)  A grading permit shall be required so that proper provisions for protecting against erosion losses will be made. 
(9)  The City will utilize an engineering consulting firm to assist city staff in the review of a flood study. The cost of this consultant review shall be borne by the developer, engineer or property owner submitting the flood study. 
The City shall first obtain a cost estimate from the engineering consultant for the flood study review. Before the review begins, the developer, engineer or property owner submitting the flood study shall deposit with the City funds equal to the cost estimate. The City shall disburse the funds to the consulting engineer as the review progresses. Should the consultant fees exceed the initial estimate, the developer, engineer or property owner submitting the flood study shall be informed of the shortage and a new estimate made by the consultant engineer to complete the flood study review. Additional funds will then be deposited with the City by the developer, engineer or property owner submitting the flood study to cover the estimated shortfall before the review of the study resumes. 
    These criteria shall be met before a development permit can be issued for a proposed project. Typical projects requiring a development permit include placing fill, whether or not it actually raises the property out of the floodplain, constructing a dam, straightening channel sections, making improvements, substantial or otherwise, to existing structures in a floodplain in which the existing outside dimensions of the structure are increased and temporary storage of fill materials, supplies and equipment. 
    The required submittals for a development permit are listed in Section 11-149(2). In general, the information needed for the application can be obtained by running a backwater model, such as HEC-2, and a flood routing model, such as HEC-1. Both models shall be run by permit applicants. The backwater information shall be used to determine that upstream water surface elevations and erosive velocities have not increased. Starting water surface conditions for backwater calculations are outlined in Section 11-186(c). Flood routing information shall be used to insure that the cumulative effects of the reduction in floodplain storage of flood waters will not cause downstream increases in water surface elevations and erosive velocities. 
    The City Engineer shall keep the models current with modifications to the floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 4216, § 1, 7-2-12) 
Sec. 11-209. - Verification of floodplain alterations. 
    Prior to final acceptance by the City of utilities and street construction for projects involving floodplain alterations or adjacent to defined floodplains, creeks, channels and drainageways, a certified statement shall be prepared by a registered public surveyor showing that all lot elevations, as developed within the subject project, meet or exceed the required minimum finished floor elevations shown on the final plat of the subdivision. This certification shall be filed with the City Engineer. 
    In addition, at any time in the future when a building permit is desired for existing platted property which is subject to flooding or carries a specified or recorded minimum finished floor elevation, a registered public surveyor shall survey the property prior to obtaining a building permit. The certified survey data showing the property to be at or above the specified elevation shall be furnished to the City Engineer for approval. Certificate of compliance with the provisions of this article pertaining to specified finished floor elevations shall be required. 
    The owner/developer shall furnish, at his expense, to the City Engineer sufficient engineering information to confirm that the minimum floor elevations proposed are as required by this paragraph. Construction permits will not be issued until (1) a conditional letter of map revision or amendment has been issued by FEMA, and (2) lots and/or sites are certified by a registered public surveyor and are elevated from the floodplain according to the FEMA-approved revisions to the floodplain and the requirements of this article.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 15-1. - Median improvements. 
    The following regulations and procedures are hereby established for the development of all medians that shall be developed on streets and boulevards within the city: 
(1)  The developer of a private project or the city on a public project shall develop and improve or cause the development and improvement of street and boulevard medians within or a part of the project as follows: 
a.  Preparing the subsurface. 
1.  All utilities, including city utilities, gas, electric, and telephone, shall be placed in the parkway portion of right-of-way. Where it is not practical to place utilities in the parkway portion of right-of-way, utilities placed in the median shall be placed within three (3) feet of the curb of the median. Every effort shall be made to prevent placement of utilities at the center of the median. 
2.  Sleeves of the appropriate size shall be placed from median to median, and/or from water source to median. Sleeve designs are required to be approved by the city parks and recreation department, and the parks and recreation department shall assist the developer of the project with the design of the sleeve plan. 
3.  Water taps of the appropriate size with a meter box (city standard), shall be placed in the appropriate location as approved by the parks and recreation department. The parks and recreation department will recommend sites based on the street plan and the availability of the water systems. 
b.  Removal of difficult maintenance areas. Narrow areas of the median (noses) shall be paved with a minimum of four-inch concrete. An area seven (7) feet in width or less shall be deemed to be a narrow area, and paving shall be required. Other areas deemed by the parks and recreation department to be difficult maintenance areas shall be eliminated at the request of and in the manner prescribed by the city parks and recreation department. 
c.  Providing an adequate plant growing medium. Median areas not removed or eliminated as provided in paragraph (1)(b) shall be filled with six (6) inches of top soil or sandy loam. The developer shall remove all rocks, large roots, and other debris from the median area. 
d.  Planting of trees in the median. Trees shall be planted in the median as follows: 
1.  A minimum of one (1) tree of not less than two and one-half-inch caliper in size per eight hundred (800) square feet of median, exclusive of paved portions of the median, shall be planted. 
2.  The trees planted must be approved by the parks and recreation department. Approved trees are as follows: 
Eastern Red Cedar 
Crape Myrtle 
Bald Cypress 
Pond Cypress 
Cedar Elm 
Ginkgo 
Goldenrain Tree 
Deciduous Holly 
All Oaks 
Flowering Peach 
Bradford Pear 
Eldarica Pine 
Chinese Pistachio 
Purpleleaf Plum 
Redbud 
Sweetgum 
3.  Conceptual plans shown in Exhibit "A" (attached to Ordinance No. 2617) shall serve as a guide to planting trees in the median, except the visibility setbacks are required and must be adhered to. 
e.  Establishment of ground cover. Ground cover in the unpaved median areas shall be required. Such ground cover shall consist of Bermuda grass established sufficiently to be considered a full coverage of the soil as determined by the parks and recreation department. 
f.  Additional improvements. Median improvements in addition to those required, including but not limited to larger trees, shrubs, irrigation, and color beds, may be permitted upon submission to and approval of the parks and recreation department. Maintenance requirements shall be the primary consideration of the parks and recreation department in considering improvement plans including more than the required improvements. 
g.  Maintenance responsibility of the private developer. 
1.  Maintenance of median improvements of private developers shall be the responsibility of the private developer for a period of two (2) years following the acceptance of the improvements by the parks and recreation department. The maintenance to be provided shall include mowing and edging the grass on a regular basis, watering the trees sufficiently to maintain vigor, replacement of dead or dying trees, litter control, weed control, and any other maintenance necessary for the upkeep of the median in an attractive manner. 
2.  In order to guarantee performance of the median maintenance, the private developer shall be required to establish an escrow account with the city for such purpose. The amount placed in escrow shall be equal to the cost of the maintenance of the median improvements for two (2) years. Such cost shall be determined by the parks and recreation department based upon current maintenance costs. If satisfactory maintenance is accomplished by the developer during the first year of the two-year required maintenance, one-half (1/2) of the amount in escrow shall be released at the end of the first year. The remainder of the escrow amount shall be returned to the developer at the close of the second year of satisfactory maintenance. If at any time during the required two-year maintenance period the developer shall fail to maintain the median, the city park and recreation department shall utilize funds from the escrow account to accomplish the maintenance and such amount shall be deducted from any amount returned to the developer at the end of the two-year maintenance period. If satisfactory maintenance is not accomplished for any period during the first year of the two-year maintenance period, no funds shall be returned to the developer until the end of the entire two-year period, at which time remaining funds, if any, shall be returned to the developer. Any interest accrued on the escrow account shall be the property of the city. 
(2)  Contract and maintenance on city projects. 
a.  Contract. On city paving projects, all irrigations and electrical service shall be installed as part of paving contract per location given in the plans by park and recreation. The city may contract for the median improvements and beautification separately from the contract for paving the street or boulevard. 
b.  Maintenance. The city shall water and maintain the trees upon acceptance. The city, upon acceptance of the turf, will contract the turf maintenance. 
(3)  County projects. 
a.  Generally. Median improvements on county paving projects, all irrigations and electrical service shall be installed as part of paving contract per location given in the plans by park and recreation. The city shall contract the median improvements. 
b.  Maintenance. The city shall water and maintain the trees upon acceptance. The city, upon acceptance of the turf, will contract the turf maintenance.

(1)  In the event the Director determines, based upon reasonable grounds, that a bond is necessary to protect the public assets, or the health and safety of the public, then the Director may require a user to post financial security in an amount not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). The Director shall consult with the City's Finance Director prior to imposing the financial security requirement on a user. Factors to be considered in determining reasonable grounds may include, but are not limited to a conviction for violation of this article, a general pattern of substandard adherence to the provisions of this article, a failure to provide prompt resolution of claims or the failure to comply with this article. If three (3) years pass from the date that the Director requires financial security from a user and it has not been necessary for the City to seek performance under the financial security, then financial security will no longer be required pursuant to this section unless the Director makes an additional determination that such security is required. The form of financial security shall be, at the user's option, one (1) of the following: 
a.  A surety bond from a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Texas with a registered agent for service in Dallas County, Texas. All bonds shall be on City approved forms; 
b.  A cash deposit. 
(2)  Security provided by a cash deposit shall be made to an interest bearing account during the term of the deposit. At the end of the deposit period, all unused amounts, plus interest, shall be refunded to the user. 
(3)  Failure of the user to comply with its obligations under this article or the permit, as determined by the City, shall entitle the City to draw against the financial security required by this section. The rights reserved to the City with respect to the financial security are in addition to all other rights of the City whether reserved by this article or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such financial security shall affect any other rights the City may have. 
(4)  Financial security provided by a surety bond shall not expire or be materially altered without forty-five (45) calendar days written notice and without securing and delivering to the City a substitute, renewal and replacement bond in accordance with this article, consistent with the replacement and continuous coverage requirements for insurance found in Section 15-198 hereof. In the event the City draws monies against the bond, City shall so notify user. Within ten (10) calendar days after such notification the user shall pay such funds to the bonding company as necessary to bring the bond back to the original or adjusted principal amount where it shall continue to be maintained at all times. The bond shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be reduced, altered or canceled by the user or the bonding company without forty-five (45) calendar days written notice by certified mail to the City." 
(5)  If the City draws monies out of a cash deposit, the City shall so notify user. Within ten (10) calendar days after such notification the user shall deposit additional funds in such account sufficient to bring the balance available back to the original or adjusted principal amount.

Any surety bond, letter of credit or assignment of a savings account must be in a form and format approved by the city. The company writing the surety bond must be authorized to do business in Dallas County.

Residential and commercial customers must provide identification of the person in whose name the service is to be billed by supplying a driver's license number or other identification showing proof of name. 
(2)  Additional deposits-Residential. When and if it is found that the deposit required, and as collected according to the above schedule, is not sufficient to protect the City from losses, and it becomes necessary to disconnect service to any customer because of nonpayment of his water utility bill, the City shall require an additional minimum deposit of ten dollars ($10.00) up to a maximum deposit of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) or three (3) months' estimated water utility bill, whichever is larger, before water service is reconnected.

(4)  Deficient deposits, commercial. When and if it is found that a commercial customer's deposit is insufficient to cover three (3) months' estimated water utility bill and that the commercial customer is two (2) months' past due three (3) times in a one-year period, the commercial customer shall be required to place additional deposit, surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit or assignment of a savings account, great enough to equal three (3) months' estimated water utility bill. 
(5)  Additional construction on a commercial customer's property. When construction occurs on commercial property that is expected to cause additional consumption to occur, the customer's deposit requirement may be recalculated and increased sufficient to cover an estimated three-month water utility bill. Such additional deposit must be furnished to the city within thirty (30) days of recalculation by the city and may be placed in any allowable form described in subsection (1). Failure to furnish such increased deposit shall result in the disconnection of the customer's water service as provided in section 16-4.

b.  All unpaid bills on the customer's previous account must be paid; and

(d)  City reimbursement. If the request for city participation is approved by the city council following dedication and acceptance of a facility or appurtenances in which it has agreed to participate, the city shall refund the costs of oversizing such facility in accordance with the following procedures and standards. 
(1)  Oversizing standards. The following standards apply to the determination of the costs of oversizing water and/or wastewater mains: 
a.  Where the size of the water or wastewater main needed exceeds that of a 12-inch diameter water or wastewater main, the size of the main to be installed shall be determined by the city engineer whose decision shall be final. 
b.  The amount of the city's participation shall be determined by the city council and shall not exceed the difference in cost between a 12-inch diameter main with appurtenances and the oversized main with appurtenances as required by the city engineer. 
(2)  Oversize cost determination. The extent of the city's participation in the costs of oversized mains shall be determined by comparing costs computed by the following two (2) methods: 
a.  Method 1. The developer shall take at least three (3) bids on installation of a system using a 12-inch diameter main and the larger size that will actually be installed. Copies of the bids, tabulations and figures shall be submitted to the city engineer. Calculations shall delineate the total cost for installation of the oversize mains with appurtenances, along with the cost for installing 12-inch diameter mains with appurtenances, with the differences noted as participation by the city. 
b.  Method 2. The city engineer shall establish unit prices for similar types of construction done in the previous twelve (12) months. These unit prices shall establish costs based upon estimates obtained on similar projects within the last twelve (12) months or base unit costs used to determine the maximum difference in cost between the 12-inch diameter main size and the cost of oversize mains to be installed. The unit prices shall be incorporated into this section as if fully set forth herein and shall be used to determine the city's participation. 
c.  City engineer's option. The city engineer shall have the option to establish the method in subsection b. whenever he considers the results of the method in subsection a. to be unreasonable or whenever the developer fails to submit the proper information as required. 
d.  Engineering costs. The city shall pay a maximum of six (6) percent of the city's cost for engineering fees that includes surveying, construction staking and supervision. 
e.  Street rights-of-way. A development shall be responsible for the full cost of utilities which cross street right-of-way up to a maximum width of one hundred sixty (160) feet. If required street right-of-way exceeds one hundred sixty (160) feet, the city will assume the cost of the excess length of the utility line as oversize participation. 
(3)  Exception to city participation. The city will not participate in the cost of an oversized main if the development requires a main equal to the line constructed to serve the development. 
(Ord. No. 3372, § 1, 6-19-00) 
Sec. 16-36. - Extension of mains by city. 
(a)  Extension to serve development. The city may, but shall not be required to, extend a water or wastewater main to serve a development in lieu of installation by the developer subject to the following standards and procedures: 
(1)  Request by developer. The developer may petition the city to extend a water or wastewater main to serve the development in lieu of the developer constructing the facilities. 
(2)  Criteria. If the city agrees to extend the water or wastewater main, the city's procedures for competitive bidding and award of contract must be followed. The developer shall execute an improvement agreement with the city prior to the initiation of construction. 
(3)  Condition of extension. As a condition of granting the developer's request to extend a water or wastewater main, the developer shall deposit cash in an amount equal to one hundred (100) percent of the projected costs of the extension, less the cost of the city's oversize participation if applicable, together with easements required by subsection 16-34(c). Such deposit shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect the obligation of the developer to pay, impact fees for water or wastewater facilities; provided, however, that the city may credit deposits by the developer under this section which exceed the cost of a 12-inch diameter main against impact fees due for water or wastewater facilities in the manner prescribed in section 7.5-22.

Obtaining an industrial user wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to obtain other permits required by federal, state, or local law. 
(c)  The environmental officer may require that other industrial users, including liquid waste haulers, obtain industrial user wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article. 
(d)  All existing significant users connected to or contributing to the POTW shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of this chapter. The application must be submitted to the control authority within ninety (90) days after the effective date of this chapter. 
(e)  New connections. Any significant industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging nondomestic wastes into the sanitary sewer system must obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior to beginning or recommencing such discharge. For categorical industrial users, a baseline monitoring report (see section 16-93) will be used as an application for this permit and must be filed at least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge. For non-categorical industrial users, a permit application must be filed in accordance with section 16-98. 
(f)  Reapplication. Once permitted, the industrial user has the duty to reapply if the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by the permit after the expiration date of the permit. The industrial user must submit an application for a new permit at least ninety (90) days before the expiration of the permit in accordance with section 16-98. The application form may be obtained from the control authority. 
(Ord. No. 2977, § 7, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 16-93. - Baseline monitoring report. 
    Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) below. Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the director or the regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140(b) (1977), the industrial user will not be required to submit this information again. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (1) through (5) below. New sources shall also be required to include this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in paragraphs (4) and (5). 
(1)  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operators and owners; 
(2)  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility;

This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
(4)  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
a.  Regulated process streams; and 
b.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) 
The control authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants: 
a.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process; 
b.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
c.  A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, twenty-four-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The control authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
d.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. 
e.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority. 
f.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator. 
g.  The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline monitoring report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; 
h.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(6)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in section 16-100), and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements; and 
(7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
a.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by this section, the information required by paragraphs (7) and (8) shall pertain to the modified limits. 
b.

(Ord. No. 2977, § 27, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 16-113. - Bypass. 
(a)  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c), below. 
(b)  Notice. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, if possible at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(c)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The Industrial User submitted notices as required under paragraph (b) of this section. 
(2)  The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2977, § 28, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 16-114. - Slug control plan. 
(a)  Each industrial user shall provide protection from slug discharges, as defined in section 16-86 of this division. The control authority may require the industrial user to develop and implement a slug control plan. The plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five (5) days; 
(4)  If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operation, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(Ord. No. 2977, § 29, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 16-115. - Notice of potential problems, including slug loading.

(Ord. No. 2977, § 30, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 16-116. - Upsets. 
(a)  Effect of an upset. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (b) are met. 
(b)  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operation logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the following to the POTW and control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days); 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and the cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
c.  Steps being taken and/or plans to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(c)  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(d)  Reviewability of agency consideration of claims of upset. In the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, agency enforcement personnel should review any claims that non-compliance was caused by an upset. No determinations made in the course of the review constitute final agency action subject to judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity of a judicial determination of any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(e)  User responsibility in case of upset. The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Ord. No. 2977, § 31, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 16-117. - Notification of discharge of hazardous wastes. 
(a)  Industrial users shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. Industrial users shall provide the notification no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d) and (e). 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of section 16-115(a) during a calendar month in which the discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. 
    Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional information. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under section 16-115 of this division, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(Ord. No. 2977, § 32, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 16-118. - Confidential information. 
(a)  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
(b)  When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this division, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Effluent data, as defined in 40 CFR 2.302, will not be considered confidential. 
(Ord. No. 2977, § 33, 7-18-94)

APPENDIX C - ZONING ORDINANCE[1] 
Ordinance No. 1135 
Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance 
City of Mesquite, Texas 
    An ordinance amending Appendix III of the Code of the City of Mesquite; establishing and providing for zoning regulations and creating zoning districts in accordance with a comprehensive plan and within such districts regulating the use of land, buildings, and structures; regulating the height, size, and location of buildings; establishing density, open space, screening, and minimum off-street parking requirements; regulating the erection, repair and alteration of all buildings and structures; providing for conditional use permits for certain uses; recognizing nonconforming uses and structures and providing rules for the regulations thereof; creating a planning and zoning commission and creating a board of adjustment and setting forth rules for their organization, jurisdiction, and power; establishing the requirements for building sites and the manner of their creation; providing for certificate of occupancy and compliance; defining certain terms; providing a method of amendment; providing a penalty for violation of such ordinance and for injunctive relief to persons affected by the violation of said ordinance; providing a saving clause and declaring an emergency. 
    Whereas, on August 17, 1964, the city council of the City of Mesquite, in accordance with state Law, adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance which classified the area within the city limits into eleven (11) general use classifications or districts and since, then, from time to time, additional territory has been added to the City of Mesquite by annexation; and 
    Whereas, through experience and administration, the city council is of the opinion that the ordinance as originally adopted, providing eleven (11) general use districts or classifications, no longer subserves public interest and affords sufficient protection to the general welfare of the citizenship and the peaceful enjoyment of their homes and properties, and by reason thereof, the city council requested the planning and zoning commission and other consultants to conduct a study of the zoning ordinance as it existed, and the planning and zoning commission and other consultants have, after a study of more than forty-nine (49) months and after holding public hearings, as provided by law, filed with the city council of Mesquite on the fourth day of September, 1973, a revised zoning ordinance dividing the city into fifteen (15) use districts, and has recommended to the city council the adoption of such ordinance, and that the ordinance of August 17, 1964, be revised; 
    Whereas, the city council of the City of Mesquite did give public notice by publishing on the twenty-fourth day of July, 1973, in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Mesquite and by mailing public notices to all property owners of record in the City of Mesquite, setting a public hearing thereon for the twentieth day of August, 1973, and conducting such hearing until every person whose property was affected or who had any interest in the matter had an opportunity to be heard, and fair and complete hearings were afforded all who desired to be heard, and said hearings were officially closed, at which time the city council directed that the zoning ordinance be presented in its final form together with the map conforming to said ordinance, and the use districts as located on the ground be conformed to the results of their study, hearings, and personal inspection of the city, and after duly inspecting this proposed revision of the zoning ordinance finds that same represents their best judgment and opinion and will promote the health, safety, morals, general welfare, and convenience of people; 
    Now, therefore, be it ordained by the city council of the City of Mesquite, Texas: 
    That Appendix III of the Code of the City of Mesquite, Texas known as the zoning ordinance, and the amendments thereto, except Article 3, section 2 thereof, are hereby repealed, and a new ordinance is hereby enacted in lieu thereof, to read as follows; and provided further that the names of the existing zoning districts as shown on the existing official zoning map are hereby changed to read as follows: 
1.  R-2A Single Family to R-2 Single Family. 
2.  All existing townhouse zoning (A-2 Townhouse, TH-1, TH-2, special permit for Townhouses) to Planned Development. 
3.  LR Local Retail to GR General Retail. 
4.  Service stations in existing Local Retail and Commercial to SS Service Station. 
5.  Those classifications not listed above shall remain the same as they are currently shown.

    A nonconforming situation shall be a legal use under these provisions, providing that it is conducted in accordance with the regulations prescribed below. 
A.  Nonconforming status. A situation shall be classified as nonconforming and shall be a legal use under these provisions when such situation was in existence and lawfully operating at the time of adoption of the zoning provisions or amendments thereto which created the nonconforming condition, or at the time of annexation to the city, and when such situation has since been in regular and continuous existence. A situation that did not constitute a conforming or a legal nonconforming situation under previous regulations shall not achieve legal nonconforming status due to the adoption of this or subsequent amendments, unless such amendments shall make the situation conforming. 
B.  Types of nonconforming situations. A property may be nonconforming due to the failure of the use, the structure, and/or the premises to conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located. 
1.  Nonconforming use: A use that is not a permitted use in the district in which it is located. 
2.  Nonconforming structure: A structure that does not conform to the lot, setback, height or other dimensional regulations of the district in which it is located.

Additions thereto shall not be required to contain any greater percentage of exterior masonry than the structure in its present existence. Damaged residences may be reconstructed as originally constructed in regard to exterior masonry, unit size, and similar requirements. 
2.  Metal buildings: Buildings with metal exteriors which were lawfully constructed without masonry fronts may be enlarged without the construction of masonry fronts, provided none of the enlarged portion faces, sides, or backs to the street, but is entirely shielded from all streets by the existing building. 
3.  Heritage Square: Buildings fronting the north, south, or west side of Heritage Square, which are nonconforming due to lot coverage and/or lack of required parking, may be reconstructed, provided that the building size is not increased and no greater nonconformity is created.

5.  Right-of-way acquisition. A structure or premise shall not be deemed nonconforming when the cause of the nonconformity is due solely to the acquisition of right-of-way for the construction of the LBJ, Phase 2 Project, Mesquite Section. Such premises that do not meet lot coverage requirements and/or parking requirements may be reconstructed, provided that the structure's square footage is not increased, all other development standards are met and no additional nonconformity is created. 
6.  Right-of-Way Acquisition-Thomasson Square. A structure or premises shall not be deemed nonconforming under the North Gus Thomasson Corridor Revitalization Code ("the NGTCRC") when the cause of the nonconformity is due solely to the acquisition of right-of-way for the construction of the Thomasson Square Project. Such structure or premises that do not meet building disposition requirements, building configuration requirements and/or parking requirements due to acquisition may be repaired, provided that no additional nonconformity is created. Improvements to the structure or premises shall comply with the NGTCRC if not caused solely by the right-of-way acquisition or if said improvements require retrofitting of the structure or premises pursuant to Section 2.10 of the NGTCRC. 
D.  Definitions.

2.  Enlargement, extension: Enlargement or extension shall mean an increase in the building and/or land area occupied by the nonconforming situation, or an increase in the capacity of processing and operating equipment, machines, or vehicles used, but shall not mean a general increase in business or production resulting from general growth. 
3.  Major reconstruction: Major reconstruction, when damage due to fire, wind, or other cause has occurred, shall mean work estimated to cost in excess of sixty (60) percent of the appraised value of the nonconforming property. 
E.  Required compliance. 
1.  Performance standards: All uses which become nonconforming by reason of noncompliance with the provisions of 1-400 regarding performance standards shall adopt necessary measures to conform therewith within three (3) years of the adoption or annexation which creates the noncompliance.

1-302 - Nonconforming uses. 
    This section shall apply to any situation where the use in nonconforming, regardless of other nonconformity in the structure and/or premises. 
A.  Continuation. A nonconforming use may be continued as it exists, unless it is terminated under the provisions of 1-304, but shall not be changed or improved unless otherwise authorized herein, provided however that minor repairs, alteration, renovation, or reconstruction shall be permitted to keep the property in sound condition. No enlargement, extension or major reconstruction shall be permitted. 
B.  Special exceptions. The board of adjustment may authorize the following special exceptions regarding nonconforming uses. 
1.  Substitution of use: To allow the substitution of a less objectionable use for the existing nonconforming use where the board determines that the substitute use will have less adverse impacts on the adjacent properties and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. When a substitution has been authorized, only the substituted use retains nonconforming status. 
(Ord. No. 2668, 4-2-90) 
1-303 - Nonconforming structures and premises. 
    This section shall apply to those situations where nonconformity exists in the structures and/or premises, but where the use is conforming. If the use is also nonconforming, then 1-302 shall apply. 
A.  Continuation. A nonconforming structure and/or premises may be continued as it exists, unless it is terminated under the provisions of 1-304. The following changes and improvements shall be permitted. 
1.  Major improvements and enlargement of a nonconforming structure on conforming premises: Major repair, alteration, renovation, enlargement, or extension of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted, provided that no greater or additional nonconformity is created and that all nonconformity of the premises is eliminated. 
2.  Change of use: The use of a nonconforming structure and/or premises may be changed to any conforming use, provided that special conditions for that use do not create greater or additional nonconformity. This provision shall not authorize the conversion of a residence located in a nonresidential district to a nonresidential use, unless the structure and premises are made to conform to all requirements of the nonresidential district. 
B.  Special exceptions. The board of adjustment may authorize the following special exceptions regarding nonconforming structures and/or premises. 
1.  Major improvements and enlargement of a nonconforming structure on nonconforming premises: To allow major repair, alteration, renovation, enlargement, or extension of a nonconforming structure in situations when all nonconformity in the premises will not be eliminated where the board determines that the elimination of the nonconformity is not reasonably possible because it cannot be accommodated without adding additional land; without moving a substantial structure on a permanent foundation; without creating an unacceptable situation regarding practical and reasonable utilization of the property, particularly in regard to access and circulation; or without creating a health or safety hazard. 
2.  Major reconstruction: To allow the major reconstruction of a structure with dimensional nonconformity on the existing foundation where the board determines that the structure previously existed without substantial impact on the adjacent properties and that the reconstruction will not create more adverse impacts. 
(Ord. No. 2668, 4-2-90) 
1-304 - Termination of nonconforming situations. 
A.  Change to conforming. Whenever a nonconforming situation has been changed to a conforming situation, such situation shall be deemed to be permanently abandoned and shall not be reinstituted on the property. 
B.  Discontinuance. The right to operate a nonconforming use or premises, or a portion thereof, shall terminate if the nonconforming use or premises is abandoned or if it is discontinued for six (6) months or more. The board may determine that a use or premises which remains vacant or unused for six (6) months or more has not been discontinued under the intent of this section if the owner can state unusual circumstances which prevented or precluded use of the property during that period, in which case the property may be reoccupied and the nonconforming use reinstituted in compliance with the other provisions of this section. 
C.  Amortization. 
1.  Compliance regulations for nonconforming uses. It is the declared purpose of this subsection that nonconforming uses be eliminated and be required to comply with the regulations of the Mesquite Zoning Code, having due regard for the property rights of the persons affected, the public welfare and the character of the surrounding area. 
a.  Amortization of nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Request to establish compliance date. The City Council may request that the Board of Adjustment ("Board") consider establishing a compliance date for a nonconforming use. In addition, any person who resides or owns real property in the City may request that the Board consider establishing a compliance date for a nonconforming use. Upon receiving such a request, the Board shall hold a public hearing to determine whether continued operation of the nonconforming use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties. If, based on the evidence presented at the public hearing, the Board determines that continued operation of the use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties, it shall proceed to establish a compliance date for the nonconforming use; otherwise, it shall not. 
(2)  Factors to be considered. The Board shall consider the following factors when determining whether continued operation of the nonconforming use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties: 
(a)  The character of the surrounding neighborhood. 
(b)  The degree of incompatibility of the use with the zoning district in which it is located. 
(c)  The manner in which the use is being conducted. 
(d)  The hours of operation of the use. 
(e)  The extent to which continued operation of the use may threaten public health or safety. 
(f)  The environmental impacts of the use's operation, including but not limited to the impacts of noise, glare, dust and odor. 
(g)  The extent to which public disturbances may be created or perpetuated by continued operation of the use. 
(h)  The extent to which traffic or parking problems may be created or perpetuated by continued operation of the use. 
(i)  Any other factors relevant to the issue of whether continued operation of the use will adversely affect nearby properties. 
(3)  Finality of decision. A decision by the Board to grant a request to establish a compliance date is not a final decision and cannot be immediately appealed. A decision by the Board to deny a request to establish a compliance date is final unless appealed to state court within ten (10) days in accordance with Chapter 211 of the Local Government Code. 
(4)  Determination of amortization period. 
(a)  If the Board determines that continued operation of the nonconforming use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties, it shall, in accordance with the law, provide a compliance date for the nonconforming use under a plan whereby the owner's actual investment in the use before the time that the use became nonconforming can be amortized within a definite time period. 
(b)  The following factors must be considered by the Board in determining a reasonable amortization period: 
i.  The owner's capital investment in structures, fixed equipment and other assets (excluding inventory and other assets that may be feasibly transferred to another site) on the property before the time the use became nonconforming. 
ii.  Any costs that are directly attributable to the establishment of a compliance date, including demolition expenses, relocation expenses, termination of leases and discharge of mortgages. 
iii.  Any return on investment since inception of the use, including net income and depreciation. 
iv.  The anticipated annual recovery of investment, including net income and depreciation. 
(5)  Compliance requirement. If the Board establishes a compliance date for a nonconforming use, the use must cease operations on that date and it may not operate thereafter unless it becomes a conforming use. 
(6)  Definition of owner. For purposes of this Section 1-304(C), "owner" means the owner of the nonconforming use at the time of the Board's determination of a compliance date for the nonconforming use. 
(Ord. No. 2668, 4-2-90; Ord. No. 4553, § 1, 4-16-18) 
1-400 - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 

1-401 - Compliance required. 
    In all zoning districts, any use indicated as a permitted use shall conform in operation, location, and construction to the performance standards hereinafter specified. 
A.  Procedures. If in the judgment of the director of community development, there are reasonable grounds to believe that a use proposed by application for a building permit or a certificate of occupancy is likely to violate performance standards, the applicant shall be required to submit information to determine how and if compliance will be assured. If the director of community development determines that compliance cannot be achieved, no building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued. An applicant may appeal the determination of the director of community development to the city council. 
B.  Enforcement. Even though compliance with performance standards may not be verified in obtaining a building permit or a certificate of occupancy, initial and continued compliance with performance standards is required for every use, and provisions for enforcement of continued compliance shall be enforced by the director of community development and the health official against any use, if there are reasonable grounds to believe that performance standards are being violated by such use. 
C.  Nonconforming uses. Certain uses established before the effective date of this ordinance and nonconforming as to performance standards shall be given a reasonable time in which to conform therewith as provided in Section 1-301E. 
D.  Location for enforcement. Unless otherwise stated, standards shall apply at the bounding property line and, unless otherwise stated, measurements necessary for enforcement shall be taken at any or all points at the bounding property line. The bounding property line shall be interpreted as being at the near side of any street, alley, stream, or other permanently dedicated open space from the source of the element to be measured when such open space exists between the property line of the source and adjacent property. When no such open space exists, the common line between two (2) parcels of property shall be interpreted as the bounding property line. 
E.  Exemptions. The following sources of potentially excessive emissions shall be exempt from these performance standard regulations: 
1.  The use of any signal, siren, horn, vehicle, or equipment when responding to an emergency situation or when being tested for such emergency use. 
2.  The performance of any public work, including public street, utility and safety operations, acting to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community, and including any training or testing conducted in preparation for such public safety, service or emergency operations, including fire training exercises. 
3.  Public or private school sponsored activities conducted on public playgrounds and public or private grounds including, but not limited to, school athletic and school entertainment events; and special events conducted on public parks. Special event means an event occurring no more than once in a calendar year, being no longer than five (5) days in duration and which complies with all park use permit requirements. 
4.  Any activity legally approved, permitted, and controlled under other provisions of the city Code, such as open burning when proper burn permits have been obtained. 
(Ord. No. 2816, § 1(d), 6-1-92; Ord. No. 3045, § 1, 8-7-95) 
1-402 - Noise. 
    At no point at the bounding property line of any use shall the sound pressure level of any operation or plat exceed the decibel limits specified in the land use district designation in the following table:

A.  Limits. It shall be unlawful for any person at any location in the City of Mesquite to create any noise, or to allow the creation of any noise on property owned, leased, occupied or otherwise controlled by the boundaries of the property for which the noise is produced, or measured within any other residential dwelling unit or commercial space, to exceed: 
1.  The noise standard in any measurement period not less than thirty (30) minutes; or 
2.  The noise standard plus fifteen (15) dB(A) in any one (1) minute average of a measurement period; or 
3.  The noise standard plus twenty (20) dB(A) at any time in a measurement period. 
B.  Adjustments. 
1.  For the purpose of enforcing these provisions, a measurement period shall not be less than thirty (30) minutes. 
2.  In the event the ambient sound level exceeds the resulting standards, the ambient level shall be the standard. 
3.  If the intruding noise source is continuous and cannot reasonably be discontinued or stopped for a time period whereby the ambient sound level can be determined, the measured sound level obtained while the source is in operation shall be compared directly to the applicable standard in the receiving land use district on which the sound is measured. 
C.  Corrections for character. 
1.  For any stationary source of sound which emits a pure tone, cyclically varying sound, or repetitive impulsive sound, the limits set forth in Table 1 shall be reduced by five (5) dB(A). 
2.  Notwithstanding compliance with this section, it shall be a violation of this ordinance for any person to operate or permit to be operated any stationary source of sound which emits a pure tone, cyclically varying or repetitive impulsive sound which creates a noise disturbance. 
3.  When the land use district designation of the property on which the source of sound originates differs from the designation of the property on which the sound is measured, the maximum permissible sound level of the more restrictive land use district designation shall apply. 
4.  For sound emitted on public property, the measurement distance shall be fifty (50) feet (fifteen (15) meters) and the sound level limit for the appropriate land use district shall apply. 
Cross reference- Noise, § 10-66 et seq. 
1-403 - Smoke and particulate matter.

Basic requirement-Minimum setbacks: An eight (8) foot high long-span precast concrete decorative screening wall and a buffer tree line shall be established and maintained along the property line abutting the residential district. The tree line may be located on either side of the wall provided that both the wall and tree line be located on the nonresidential property. 
This requirement shall apply except that alternate screening as set out below may be utilized when the following conditions are satisfied; provided however, that the alternate screening may not be utilized if a masonry screening wall exists or will be required on adjoining nonresidential lots and the utilization of alternative screening would result in screening which is not continuous or not consistent. 
2.  Alternate screening-Increased building setbacks: The height of the long-span precast concrete decorative screening wall may be reduced to six (6) feet whenever the nonresidential use provides an increased setback of at least three (3) feet for each foot in height above grade at the residential district boundary. The buffer tree line shall be required as specified under the Basic Requirement above. 
3.  Alternate screening-No build setbacks and adjoining public sites: A six (6) foot wrought iron fence and landscape hedge may be used for screening whenever one (1) of the following circumstances exists; provided however, that this modification is not permitted if the nonresidential use includes any outdoor storage or display, a loading yard or a service yard. 
(a)  The nonresidential use is separated from the nearest residential property by a permanent easement, right-of-way or other feature at least eighty (80) feet in width, assuring the nonresidential use does not directly abut the residential use. This alternative may be utilized where drainage and/or utility easements or rights-of-way lie between a nonresidential use and a residential use, regardless of the actual district zoning of the easement or right-of-way area. 
(b)  The nonresidential use sets aside a "buffer-yard" so that no active portion of the use; i.e., no buildings, parking, pavement, storage, or structure of any kind, is within eighty (80) feet of the residential district. This provision shall also allow deferment of masonry wall construction where the portion of a lot nearest the residential district is at least eighty (80) feet wide and is reserved for future development. In this situation, the interim screening (a six (6) foot wrought iron fence and landscape hedge) shall be placed either at the property line or at the edge of the developed portion of the lot. When construction occurs in the "buffer yard" area, the screening for the use must be upgraded to the Basic Requirement as outlined above. 
(c)  The nonresidential use is being constructed adjoining a public school, park or similar public site, which is located in a district zoned AG, R or D. 
4.  Nonresidential uses permitted in residential districts: Whenever a nonresidential use which is a permitted use in the AG, R or D district is being constructed in a nonresidential district and requires district screening, the screening required shall be the same screening which would be applicable to the use when constructed in the AG, R or D district, provided that all other development standards applicable to a residential district location are satisfied, i.e., lot size, setbacks, building heights, etc. 
B.  Nonresidential across street from a residential district: 
1.  Across divided boulevard: When a nonresidential district, other than an Industrial district, is across a boulevard street with median from a residential district, the nonresidential use shall provide a parking screen along the perimeter of any parking area parallel to the street. 
2.  Across undivided street: When a nonresidential district, other than an Industrial district, is across an undivided street from a residential district, the nonresidential use shall provide a ten (10) foot wide landscape strip along the property line parallel to the street. A buffer tree line shall be established in the landscape strip; and a parking screen shall be established along the perimeter of any parking area adjoining the landscape strip. Driveways across a landscape strip to a non-arterial street shall be prohibited except when access to a non-arterial street is required for adequate circulation or proper fire access. 
3.  Industrial district: When an Industrial district is across either a divided boulevard or an undivided street from a residential district, the use in the Industrial district shall provide a twenty-five (25) foot wide landscape strip along the property line parallel to the street. A buffer tree line shall be established in the landscape strip; and a parking screen shall be established along the perimeter of any parking area adjoining the landscape strip. Driveways across a landscape strip to a non-arterial street shall be prohibited, except when access to a non-arterial street is required for adequate circulation or proper fire access. 
C.  Nonresidential uses adjacent to a residence within the central business or mixed use districts: When a lot in the CB or MU district that is occupied by a nonresidential use backs or sides on a lot that is in residential use, a long-span precast concrete decorative screening wall, no less than eight (8) feet in height, shall be erected and maintained along the property line dividing the lots. 
D.  Nonresidential service areas abutting a street: When the service area of a nonresidential use is located so as to be visible from a street, a 10-foot wide landscape strip shall be created along the street right-of-way line, in which a solid screen, eight (8) feet in height, shall be established through the use of either (i) a solid landscape hedge planted in the center of the landscape strips; or (ii) a long-span precast concrete decorative screening wall located along the inside line of the landscape strip with shrubs and trees planted in front of the wall on the street side. "Service area" shall mean loading docks, loading areas, overhead doors used for loading, staging areas, truck docks and commercial vehicle parking areas. 
E.  Permitted nonresidential uses in a residential district: When a parking lot for a permitted nonresidential use in a residential district abuts, is across an alley, easement, or a residential street, or is otherwise within one hundred (100) feet of any single family or duplex lot, whether or not such lot is developed, a parking screen shall be provided along the perimeter of any parking area within one hundred (100) feet of such lot.

1A-304 - Multifamily use requirements. 
A.  Multifamily abutting an R or D district at the rear or side: When a multifamily district backs or sides upon a single family or duplex residential district, an eight (8) foot long-span precast concrete decorative screening wall and a buffer tree line shall be established and maintained along the property line abutting the single family or duplex residential district. The buffer tree line may be located on either side of the wall, provided that both the wall and tree line be located on the multifamily property. Alternate screening, as set out in 1A-303(A) above may be utilized by a multifamily use when stated conditions of 1A-303(A) are satisfied. 
B.  Multifamily across street from an R or D district: When a multifamily district is across a street from a single family or duplex district, the multifamily use shall provide a twenty-five (25) foot landscape strip along the property line parallel to the street. A buffer tree line shall be established in the landscape strip; and a parking screen shall be established along the perimeter of any parking areas adjoining the landscape strip. Driveways across a landscape strip to non-arterial streets shall be prohibited, except when access to a non- arterial street is required for adequate circulation or property fire access. 
(Ord. No. 3129, § 1, 12-16-96; Ord. No. 3343, § 1(3), 11-15-99; Ord. No. 4341, § 1, 10-20-14; Ord. No. 4398, § 1(7), 11-2-15) 
1A-305 - Single family and duplex use requirements. 
A.  Single family lots abutting an arterial street at the rear or side: When a subdivision is platted so that one (1) or more single family or duplex lots back or side to an arterial street, whether or not there is an intervening alley, continuous screening shall be provided along the arterial as follows: 
1.  Screening wall: A long-span precast concrete decorative screening wall, eight (8) feet in height, in earthtone colors, shall be erected on the street right-of-way line. Color, texture and materials shall be uniform/compatible on both sides of an arterial for the entire length between intersecting arterial streets. As an alternative, a wrought iron fence, six (6) to eight (8) feet in height, with evergreen trees selected from Section 1A-500 shall be installed at intervals to effectively create a visual screen. At the time of planting, the trees must, at minimum, be the height of the wrought iron fence. 
2.  Ironwork and brick combination: In areas where the view beyond the fence is a landscaped side or front yard, i.e. there is no view of rear yards, a combination of brick and ironwork fencing may be utilized. Color, texture, and materials of the masonry portions shall be in accordance with the previous paragraph. 
3.  Landscaping/ sidewalks: Landscaping shall be required along a minimum of fifteen (15) percent of the masonry wall elevations in the form of planting areas a minimum of three (3) feet in width containing ornamental trees and/or shrubs. Planting areas shall be formed through the use of wall insets, meandering sidewalks, etc. to create visual relief along the wall. Sidewalks shall be a minimum four (4) feet in width and placed adjacent to the wall, except when offset or meandering in conjunction with the planting areas. 
4.  Front Setback: The requirement for screening shall not extend beyond the building line of lots fronting a residential street that intersects the arterial. 
5.  Installation: Installation of the screening is required prior to issuance of permits on any adjacent lots. 
B.  Single family fronting an arterial street: Single family and duplex lots fronting an arterial street shall be prohibited, except in the following circumstances: 1) A residential street is constructed parallel to the arterial to provide access and visitor parking for the lots; or 2) Each single family lot provides a minimum one hundred (100) foot width, a fifty (50) foot front building line, and a circular driveway with a minimum of six (6) off-street, paved visitor parking spaces provided. 
(Ord. No. 3129, § 1, 12-16-96; Ord. No. 4341, § 1, 10-20-14; Ord. No. 4398, § 1(8), 11-2-15) 
1A-400 - TREE PRESERVATION 
    In all zoning districts, the preservation and protection of trees shall be required. Removal of protected trees shall be prohibited except in accordance with the procedures outlined herein. 
(Ord. No. 3129, § 1, 12-16-96; Ord. No. 4341, § 1, 10-20-14) 

1A-401 - Purpose. 
    Trees provide a valuable amenity to the urban environment in the maintenance of the public health and welfare, in the conservation of vital energy resources, and in the preservation of the City's historical heritage. Because trees which have survived generations of inhabitants can be replaced only after future generations, the preservation and protection of trees is essential to the health and general welfare of the City's residents. These rules and regulations, therefore, govern the protection of trees within the City of Mesquite, encouraging the preservation and protection of significant trees, while providing for replacement and replanting of trees that are necessarily removed during construction, development, or redevelopment. 
(Ord. No. 3129, § 1, 12-16-96; Ord. No. 4341, § 1, 10-20-14) 
1A-402 - General provisions.

3.  Single Family Residential Property: Developed property which is zoned in a single family residential classification and where an existing residence is located shall not be subject to this section. 
C.  Definitions: 
1.  Protected Trees: Protected tree means any tree named in 1A-500-1 Tree Schedule which is at least of the size indicated as protected size for the category in which the tree is listed. 
2.  Replacement Trees: Replacement trees are those species acceptable for use in fulfilling the tree replacement requirements of 1A-403E. Replacement trees are marked with an asterisk (*) in 1A-500-1 Tree Schedule. 
3.  Removal: Removal, as applied to protected trees, means uprooting, severing the main trunk of the tree or any act which causes, or may reasonably be expected to cause, the tree to die including but not limited to damage inflicted upon the root system by machinery, storage of materials or soil compaction; substantially changing the natural grade above the root system or around the trunk; excessive pruning; or paving with concrete, asphalt, or other impervious materials. 
a.  Transplanting a tree to a location on the same property shall not be deemed removal, provided that the tree survives for a period of at least twelve (12) months. 
b.  The removal of broken limbs or the removal of a protected tree that has been uprooted or has a broken trunk shall be allowed without application for a removal permit, provided that the removal is effected before the beginning of the tenth (10 th ) business day following the occurrence of the damage and provided further, that the period may be extended in the case of widespread and extensive storm damage. 
D.  Protection during construction: During any construction or land development, the developer or builder shall clearly mark all protected trees or groups of protected trees to be preserved. A fence shall be provided around the drip line of all protected trees. Such fence shall be four (4) feet in height with T-posts every eight (8) feet. The Municipal Arborist may approve other equivalent fencing materials. If the area within the drip line of the tree does not have existing turf, mulch shall be provided within the drip line area and watered once per week. The developer shall not allow the movement of equipment or the storage of equipment, materials, debris or fill to be placed within the drip line of any such tree. The developer shall not allow cleaning of equipment or material under the canopy of any such tree or group of trees, nor shall the developer allow the disposal of any waste material such as, but not limited to, paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar, etc. under the canopy of any such tree or groups of trees to be preserved. No attachments or wires of any kind, other than those of a protective nature, shall be attached to any such tree. 
    If a cut is made to the root of a tree that is not intended to be removed or seriously injured as indicated on the plan, the cut must be made at a ninety (90) degree angle. 
    The responsible party must tunnel utilities if utilities are to run through a tree protection zone, rather than being placed along corridors between tree protection zones. 
(Ord. No. 3129, § 1, 12-16-96; Ord. No. 4341, § 1, 10-20-14) 
1A-403 - Application to remove protected trees. 
    Except as otherwise provided herein, no person, corporation, or governmental agency shall remove or cause the removal of any protected tree without first submitting appropriate application and securing approval in accordance with the following procedures and criteria. 
A.  Submission, review and approval: 
1.  Tree removal in conjunction with development or building projects: Whenever a construction project requires review and approval of a site plan, plat, or building permit, the application for tree removal shall be processed in conjunction with the site plan, plat, or building plan review, and the Director, Planning & Zoning Commission, and/or City Council shall have authority to approve tree removal in accordance with their respective authority to approve the site plan, plat, and/or building plan under consideration. 
2.  Tree removal without construction/tree removal permit required: When removal of a protected tree is proposed and the removal is not in conjunction with a construction project requiring review of a site plan, plat, and/or building permit, a Tree Removal Permit is required. Tree Removal Permit applications shall be reviewed by the Municipal Arborist, who shall approve or deny said application within twenty-one (21) days. The application for removal shall be deemed automatically granted if not denied on or before the close of business on the twenty-first (21 st ) day following the date the application was accepted. Unless otherwise stated on the permit, the tree(s) for which the Tree Removal Permit has been issued must be removed within one hundred eighty (180) days of the issuance of the permit. The Municipal Arborist may waive submission requirements if less information is required to evaluate the situation and make a determination. Decisions of the Municipal Arborist may be appealed to the Tree Board; Decisions of the Tree Board may be appealed to the City Council whose decision shall be final. 
B.  Submission requirements: An application for tree removal shall include a property survey indicating the following: 
1.  The location, trunk diameter, and species of existing protected trees on the property, and the approximate location of protected trees with branches overhanging the property. 
2.  The trees to be preserved. 
3.  An itemized list of trees, per species, to be removed indicating the total aggregate value in diameter inches. 
4.  The proposed grading of the property, showing existing and proposed elevations, including existing and proposed grades at the base of trees to be preserved. 
5.  The protective measures and barriers to be used during construction to preserve those protected trees which are to remain. 
6.  The proposed species, number, size, and location of required replacement trees. 
C.  Municipal arborist review: An application meeting the requirements set out in subsection B, above must be submitted to the Municipal Arborist for evaluation and recommendation prior to approval of any site plan, any preliminary plat for a residential subdivision, or any building permit application other than single-family residential permits. Such site plan, plat or application shall not be accepted for processing without a report from the Municipal Arborist, unless more than fourteen (14) days has passed and there is no report from the Arborist. The report from the Municipal Arborist shall make a recommendation regarding the protection and/ or removal of the protected trees. If the applicant represents that there are no protected trees on a property, the Municipal Arborist shall confirm that fact. 
D.  Criteria for review of applications: An application for removal of a protected tree shall be approved when a showing is made that the location of the tree would prevent reasonable access to the property or would preclude reasonable and lawful use of the property. Prior to determining that a protected tree precludes reasonable access or use, design alternatives shall be explored and determined to be inappropriate, impractical and/or cost prohibitive. An applicant shall be responsible for submitting design alternatives and evidence of their impracticality and/or cost prohibitive factors. In all instances, removal of a protected tree shall be approved if it is determined that the tree constitutes a hazard to life or property that cannot reasonably be mitigated without removal, or that the tree is dead, dying or diseased to the point that restoration to sound conditions is not practicable, or that its disease can be expected to be transmitted to other trees and to endanger their health. 
E.  Mitigation: When it is deemed necessary to approve an application for protected tree removal, a replacement tree or trees shall be required to be planted on the property where the trees are removed in accordance with the following guidelines. The authority approving removal may stipulate other or lesser replacement requirements after considering the following: the size, value, and other features of trees to be removed; related on-site landscaping, trees, and vegetation; property use, visibility and relationships; and other similar factors. In circumstances where space is limited, tree mitigation can be in the form of a fee in lieu of replacement upon approval of the Municipal Arborist. Fee in lieu of shall be paid for at a rate to be established by the City Council and shall be placed in a Park Improvement Fund. The Director of Parks and Recreation shall administer the Park Improvement Fund to fund landscape improvements, reforestation, and the improvement of parkland projects. 
1.  Approved replacement trees: Trees installed to meet the requirements of this section shall be of a species indicated as replacement trees in 1A-105-1 Tree Schedule, and shall be installed at the minimum size indicated or larger. 
2.  Planting requirements: Tree replacement must occur at the time of installation of other required landscaping. If no other landscape is required, tree replacement shall occur prior to issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy. Replacement trees which do not survive for a period of at least twelve (12) months shall be replaced until they survive. 
3.  Calculation of required replacements: The replacement requirement shall be calculated as follows: 
a.  When protected size is expressed in trunk diameter, the trunk diameter shall be recorded for each protected tree to be removed, with all the respective trunk diameters being added together to produce a total aggregate value expressed in diameter inches. Where only one (1) protected tree is to be removed, its trunk diameter shall represent the total aggregate value. 
b.  When protected size is expressed in height, the height shall be recorded for each protected tree to be removed, with all the respective heights being added together to produce a total aggregate value expressed in total feet of height. Where only one (1) protected tree is to be removed, its height shall represent the total aggregate value. 
c.  Replacement trees of sufficient number and trunk diameter and/or total height shall be provided to produce a total aggregate value equal to or exceeding the total aggregate value of the tree or trees to be removed. Provided however, that in no case shall the number of replacement trees be required to exceed more than one (1) tree for each five hundred (500) square feet of unpaved site area. 
F.  Unauthorized removal: Unauthorized removal of a protected tree is prohibited. A person convicted of violating this provision shall be subject to a fine of up to two thousand dollars ($2000.00) per protected tree removed or seriously injured without authorization, and up to two thousand dollars ($2000.00) per day for any other violation of this section. 
G.  Special exception for tree preservation: Where removal of a protected tree would become unnecessary if the development standards required by zoning were modified, the application for removal shall be denied and an application to the Board of Adjustment shall be initiated at no fee. The Board shall be authorized to approve a Special Exception for Tree Preservation which may modify the development standards required. The Board shall consider the value and benefit of tree preservation and may approve such modifications to development standards where it determines that such modification can be accommodated without creating adverse impacts on adjacent properties and that such modification is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.

PART 2. - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 
2-100 - DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED 

2-101 - AG-Agricultural. 
    The AG district is established primarily to accommodate and protect residential estate development at a semi-rural density; and secondarily to provide for agricultural uses which are to be retained. This district also accommodates parks, schools, churches and other public and semi-public facilities to serve and complement the residential development. The district shall be used as the classification for newly annexed territory. This district will generally be applied in areas of existing estate homes and in areas to be reserved for estate home development; in areas where agricultural uses are to be retained; and in newly annexed territory. 
(Ord. No. 2669. 4-16-90) 
2-102 - R-single family residential. 
    The R-districts are established to accommodate and protect single family detached residential development, providing a variety of housing densities and sizes throughout the city. These districts also accommodate parks, schools, churches, and other public and semi-public facilities to serve and complement the residential development. 
A.  R-1, R-1A and R-2 Single family. To establish and maintain areas at a lower than average density under full service conditions, thereby providing greater privacy and areas for larger homes. These districts will generally be applied throughout the city in areas of existing large lot/large home development, in areas adjacent to existing large lot/large home development, and in areas to be reserved for large lot/large home development. 
B.  R-2A and R-3 Single family. To establish and maintain areas at an average density for average size homes. These districts will be applied throughout the city in areas of existing conventional development and in larger areas appropriate for conventional residential development. 
(Ord. No. 2669. 4-16-90) 
2-103 - D-Duplex residential. 
    The D-district is establish to accommodate housing at a higher than average density, thereby providing small lot single family attached/duplex housing opportunities. The district also accommodates parks, schools, churches, and other public and semi-public facilities to serve and complement the residential development. This district will generally be applied throughout the city on small, infill tracts adjacent to conventional neighborhoods where conventional development is impractical due to the size, shape, or location of the tract. This district will generally not be applied as the classification for larger residential areas. 
(Ord. No. 2669, 4-16-90) 
2-104 - A-Multifamily residential. 
    The A-districts are established to accommodate multifamily housing, thereby providing for apartment and condominium housing opportunities. The districts also accommodate parks, schools, churches, and other public and semi-public facilities to serve and complement the residential development. The Traditional Neighborhood Mixed Residential (TNMR) zoning district is established to create new regulations for infill multifamily development and is expressly intended to replace the A-districts on land designated on the Mesquite Comprehensive Plan as appropriate for Urban Multifamily Residential. After June 7, 2010, no property within the City shall be rezoned to any of the A-districts. 
A.  A-1 Multifamily. To accommodate multifamily developments which are low in density and located park-like settings with extensive open space. This district generally applies to existing multifamily zones which are not located in areas where greater density is appropriate. 
B.  A-2 Multifamily. To accommodate multifamily developments in location where special relationships warrant a limitation of overall density. This district will generally be applied where multifamily development is appropriate, but where location is adjacent to a single family neighborhood, does not have direct freeway access, or includes flood plain/greenbelt areas in the gross acreage, thereby reducing the developable portion of the tract. 
C.  Multifamily. To accommodate multifamily development at average densities. This district will generally be applied where multifamily development is appropriate along the freeway corridors and not directly adjacent to single family development. 
D.  Traditional neighborhood mixed residential (TNMR). To accommodate new multifamily and mixed residential uses at a variety of densities and dwelling types in a traditional neighborhood setting. The district is intended for urban residential development at medium to large infill locations, including an assemblage of tracts, and provides housing choices and urban design characteristics that complement adjoining residential neighborhoods and support commercial uses within a pedestrian shed. See Section 4-1500 for TNMR district regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2669, 4-16-90; Ord. No. 4098, § 1(1), (2), 6-7-10; Ord. No. 4122, § 1(1), (2), 12-6-10) 
2-200 - USE REGULATIONS 

2-201 - General use regulations. 
    No land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall hereafter be erected, altered or converted in a residential district which is arranged, designed or used for any use other than a use specified in section 2-203 as permitted in the district in which it is located except as otherwise permitted herein or as specified in section 4-1500. 
A.  P-Permitted Uses. Principal or accessory uses indicated as "P" (permitted use) in 2-203 are permitted in the districts specified, subject to compliance with all conditions and requirements of this ordinance and other applicable provisions of the city Code. 
B.  C-Conditional Uses. Principal or accessory uses indicated as "C" (conditional use) in 2-203 may be permitted in the districts specified if expressly authorized by the city council in accordance with the procedures set out in 5-300. 
C.  S-Special Exceptions. Principal or accessory uses indicated as "S" (special exception) in 2-203 may be permitted in the districts specified if expressly authorized by the board of adjustment in accordance with the procedures set out in 5-200. 
D.  Prohibited Uses. Principal or accessory uses which are not designated in a district as "P", "C" or "S" in 2-203 shall be prohibited in that district. Refer to 3-203 for uses permitted in the nonresidential districts. 
E.  Special conditions. Special requirements for specific uses are noted in 2-203 under "Special conditions". The designated use is permitted only when in compliance with the special conditions listed. When a use is authorized as a conditional use, or as a special exception, the authorizing body may approve modification of the special conditions by specifying the allowed modification in its approval, provided that proposed modifications must be identified in the required notices as part of the request approval. Such modification may be approved if it is determined that the use can be accommodated under modified conditions without creating adverse impact on adjacent properties and that it will be compatible with the neighborhood. 
F.  Sic classified uses. Nonresidential uses listed in 2-203 include a SIC number which references the use's classification as contained in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual (1987). The SIC Manual shall be incorporated herein as a reference for the description and definition of those uses referenced by a SIC code number, except as otherwise modified herein. 
G.  Planned development district uses. The PD district is not included on the schedule of permitted uses. Uses are permitted in a PD District if the specific PD ordinance references a standard district in which the use is permitted or if the ordinance specifically lists the use as permitted in the PD district. If a use is listed as "C" or "S" in a district referenced by a PD ordinance, it shall be permitted in the PD district only when specifically authorized in accordance with 2-201B or 2-201C, unless such use is specifically listed as permitted in the PD ordinance. 
H.  Additions and revisions. The addition or removal of uses; the change of a "P," "C " or "S" designation; the revision of special conditions; or any other revisions of the schedule of permitted uses (2-203) are ordinance amendments requiring compliance with the procedures set out in 5-300. 
(Ord. No. 2669, 4-16-90; Ord. No. 4098, § 1(3), 6-7-10)

1.  AG district-Permitted nonresidential uses: A site plan for permitted nonresidential uses in the AG district shall be processed in the same manner as specified for a development site plan in a PD district, requiring courtesy notice to adjacent property owners, review and recommendation by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city council. (See 4-202) 
2.  R and D districts-Permitted nonresidential uses: A site plan for permitted nonresidential uses in R and D districts shall be processed in the same manner as a site plan in a nonresidential district, requiring approval of the development review committee. (See 3-202A) 
3.  A district: A site plan for multifamily or permitted nonresidential uses in the A district shall be processed in accordance with 2-501A. 
B.  Families per unit. No more than one (1) family shall occupy a dwelling unit. (See definitions) 
C.  Dwelling per lot. No more than one (1) dwelling unit shall occupy a lot in an AG or R district.

3-401 - General parking regulations. 
A.  Off-street parking required. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in conformance with these regulations whenever a use is established or enlarged. Required spaces shall be on the building site of the use for which they are provided, unless otherwise permitted, and may be provided in either surface parking areas or garages. Whenever there is a change in use, in floor area, or on any other unit of measurement used to determine the requirements for off-street parking spaces, additional spaces shall be provided on the basis of the increased requirement. 
B.  Use of required spaces. Required off-street parking and loading spaces shall be used only for their respective purposes and shall not be used for storage or display of vehicles or trailers for sale or rent, the storage or display of other goods, materials or products, or the location of refuse storage containers. No required parking space may be placed on front of an overhead door or other point used for vehicular access. 
C.  Submission of plans. Applications for building permits and certificates of occupancy shall include parking plans showing the design of off-street parking areas, including the layout of spaces, aisles, and the location of ingress and egress points. Parking plans shall be approved by the development review committee. Submission of a parking plan may be waived when it is not necessary to determine compliance with requirements. 
D.  Calculations. The following rules shall apply in computing the parking requirement. 
1.  Combination uses: When a building site is used for a combination of uses, the parking requirement shall be the sum of the requirements for each type of use. 
2.  Floor area: Floor areas shall mean gross square footage, except in the case of office and retail type uses where areas used for nonpublic purposes, such as storage, incidental repair, processing or packaging, show windows, offices incidental to management or maintenance, restrooms, or utility rooms, may be discounted, but shall require one (1) space per seven hundred fifty (750) square feet of such use. 
3.  Continuous seating: When seating is provided on benches or pews, each eighteen (18) inches of such seating shall be counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of calculating the parking requirement. 
4.  Fractions: When a calculation results in the requirement of a fractional space, a fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded and a fraction of one-half or greater shall require one (1) parking space. 
(Ord. No. 2650, 12-18-89) 
3-402 - Parking layout and construction standards. 
    Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public or private parking area, including commercial parking lots and vehicular display/storage areas, shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following requirements. 
A.  Minimum size and setbacks. Each parking space shall be a minimum of nine (9) feet by eighteen (18) feet, exclusive of access drives and aisles. The eighteen-foot depth may include a two-foot overhang over a paved, stoned, mulched, or grassy area which is free of obstructions, or over a sidewalk, provided that at least three (3) feet of sidewalk remains unobstructed for pedestrian movement. No space shall overhang a property line, a right-of-way line, or a landscape area which is included as part of the minimum landscape requirement. Every space shall be at least eleven (11) feet from the curb line of a public or private street. 
1.  Wheel stops required: In any parking space which faces toward a property line or a building, a wheel stop and/or curb shall be provided which prevents a vehicle from extending across the property line or hitting the building. 
2.  Parallel parking: The minimum paved dimension for a parallel parking space shall be eight (8) feet by twenty-two (22) feet. 
B.  Access. There shall be adequate provision for safe, efficient ingress and egress to all off-street parking spaces. Except for single family and duplex residential uses, no parking space may require the use of a public right-of-way or a private street for the maneuvering of a vehicle in entering or leaving the space. 
1.  Aisle width: The standard parking aisle width shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) feet, provided that a reduced width may be approved by the development review committee when the parking layout includes angled parking, one-way aisles, or other special features which comply with other applicable city standards and generally accepted practices of parking lot layout. 
2.  Fire lanes: When a parking aisle is also serving as a fire lane, then the aisle must meet the minimum width, radius, and construction standards for a fire lane, if these are greater than the requirements for a parking aisle. 
3.  Residential alleys: No access from a nonresidential use shall be permitted to an alley serving a residential district. 
C.  Drive through facilities. Any facility offering drive-through service shall provide stacking lanes which are a minimum eight (8) feet in width and which provide direct forward access to each service window, station, or other point of service. Such stacking lane shall be marked and shall be separate from any other driveway, parking space, or aisle. Stacking lanes shall be measured from the point of service and shall provide twenty (20) feet per vehicle. Common stacking lanes for several service points may be used for financial and restaurant uses, provided that separate stacking for at least three (3) vehicles is provided for each point of service before stacking is merged into a common lane. 
1.  General: Unless otherwise specified below, each service point shall be provided with a stacking lane for a minimum of three (3) vehicles. 
2.  Financial: Each teller station at a drive-through financial institution shall be provided with a stacking lane for a minimum of five (5) vehicles.

D.  Surfacing. Except as provided herein, all parking spaces and access drives shall be surfaced with asphalt or concrete pavement. All pavement must be of sufficient strength to support the heaviest vehicular loads imposed on it and shall be so graded and drained to dispose of all surface water in accordance with requirements of the City of Mesquite, and shall be marked to provide for orderly and safe loading, unloading, parking and storage of vehicles. All surfaces shall be maintained in good condition, generally free of potholes, cracks or broken pavement and allowing uninhibited access to all parking and loading spaces or drives. 
1.  Single-family and duplex residential uses. Single-family and duplex residential drives and parking shall be surfaced with concrete. 
2.  Industrial districts. For industrial-zoned parcels that do not abut a residential district or use, the development review committee may approve recycled concrete pavement for private parking areas used to store or park oversized vehicles. Such parking areas shall be designed and maintained according to specifications approved by the city engineer and subject to demonstrated compliance with the particulate standards of section 1-400. 
E.  Lighting. All parking areas in a nonresidential district which are used after dark, shall be illuminated beginning one-half hour after sunset, continuing throughout the hours of use. If only a portion of the parking area is offered for use after dark and is clearly marked, then only that part is required to be illuminated in accordance with these standards. Lighting shall meet the following minimum standards. 
1.  Intensity: An average of at least one (1) foot candle, initial measurement, and at least one-half foot candle on a maintained basis on the parking lot surface. A minimum at any point of at least 0.3 foot candle initial, and at least 0.2 foot candle maintained one-third of the average, whichever is greater. 
2.  Fixtures: Light sources shall be indirect, diffused or shielded type fixtures installed to deflect the light from adjoining properties in residential districts and from boundary streets. Bare bulbs above fifteen (15) watts are prohibited. Fixtures shall be mounted to buildings or on poles. Strings of lights are prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 3862, § 1, 4-16-07) 
3-403 - Special exceptions. 
    The board of adjustment may authorize the following special exceptions, where it finds that the peculiar nature of the use, the shape or size of the property, or other exceptional conditions would justify such action and could be accommodated without adverse impacts on adjacent properties or the surrounding neighborhood. 
A.  Off-site parking. To allow required parking spaces to be provided on a building site other than that of the use for which the spaces are required. In general, such exception may be considered for employee parking or for institutional type uses such as hospitals, churches, or other uses where longer term parking is common. A permanent and irrevocable easement of the parking facilities in favor of the premises to be benefitted thereby shall be dedicated and recorded in Dallas County records as a condition of such use. 
B.  Joint use parking. To allow joint use or collective parking. Joint use parking shall mean that required spaces provided for one (1) use may also be credited as required spaces for a complementary use. A permanent and irrevocable easement of the parking facilities in favor of the use to be benefitted thereby shall be dedicated and recorded in Dallas County records as a condition of such use. The following definitions and examples shall be used as guidelines in considering requests for joint use parking. 
1.  Complementary uses: Complementary uses are uses which generally operate at different time periods, so that one (1) use is inactive when the other is active. 
2.  Joint use percentage: The percentage or number of spaces which is allowed to be shared should be related to the proportion or number of spaces which will be available during the period or relative inactivity. 
3.  Examples: If an office parking lot is generally ninety (90) percent vacant in the evenings and on weekends, then ninety (90) percent of the spaces might be credited as also providing the parking for a church which operates primarily in the evenings and on weekends. Or, if a church parking lot is generally fifty (50) percent vacant on weekdays, then fifty (50) percent of the spaces might be credited as also providing the parking for an office which operated only on weekdays. Theaters and other evening/weekend entertainment uses may be another example of a use that might share parking with an office, bank, church, or other complementary use. 
C.  Parking reduction. The Board may approve a reduction in required parking if the use meets the criteria for a special exception in Section 5-203(A), and the Board finds that the reduction in parking will not adversely impact parking on adjacent properties, the provision of public safety or unreasonably impede use of the public right-of-way. As a guideline for evaluating a mixed-use development, the Board may consider the Shared Parking Factors in Section 4-954 and the availability of public parking within proximity of the site. 
(Ord. No. 2650-12-18-89; Ord. No. 4400, § 1(1), 11-2-15) 
3-404 - Number of parking spaces required. 
    The following regulations shall apply in determining the number of parking spaces required for a specific use or combination of uses. 
A.  Parking requirements for residential uses are specified in 2-400. For nonresidential uses, each category is assigned a "parking standard." The number of off-street parking spaces required for a specific nonresidential use shall be determined by reference to 3-203 and 3-405. 
B.  Uses not listed. For any use not listed, or where the listed standard is not applicable in the judgment of the development review committee, the parking requirements shall be established using the requirement of a similar use which is listed or an applicable standard from another source. Such determination by the development review committee may be appealed to the board of adjustment. 
C.  Handicapped parking. Parking spaces for the handicapped and disabled shall be provided as part of the required parking in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

To provide for the appropriate use of land which has a history of inundation or is determined to be subject to flood hazard and to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the community, portions of certain districts are designated with a FP prefix and shall be subject to the following provisions. 
4-302 - Permitted uses. 
    In this district no land shall be used except for one (1) or more of the following permitted uses to the extent that they are not prohibited by other regulations or ordinances and provided that such uses do not require above-ground structures, filling or storage of material or equipment except as herein specifically authorized.

Editor's note- There is no additional text with the catchlines of paragraphs B and D above. 
4-303 - Special conditions. 
A.  Conditions for adding prefix. The city council may, after a public hearing, amend the zoning classification of any property by adding the FP prefix designation, upon recommendation of the city manager's office based on hydraulic engineering studies indicating new boundaries of the area that is subject to inundation by flood waters. The city council shall provide for the addition of such floodplain FP prefix designation to the zoning district maps. 
B.  Conditions for removal of prefix. The city council, in considering and determining its recommendation relative to any application for the removal of the FP prefix designation, shall require the applicant to furnish to the department of community development, as provided in the City of Mesquite comprehensive drainage ordinance, fill and development plans, (hydraulic calculations concerning maximum high water and flow rates and their effect on abutting, lateral, and downstream properties) and data concerning the operation, location, function and characteristics of any use of land or building proposed. The application will not be scheduled for public hearing until the city engineer certifies information furnished is adequate for review and comment as required in this section.** 
Each request for the removal of the FP prefix designation shall be evaluated as to its probable effect on the adjacent property up-stream and downstream and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as the findings indicate appropriate. 
The city council may, after public hearing and upon recommendation of the city manager's office after a written report has been submitted by the director of parks and recreation, and director of community development, authorize the removal of the FP prefix designation form an area on a preliminary basis. Upon such authorization by the city council, the director of community development will issue a "floodplain modification permit" to said applicant. The director of community development shall report to the city council after the necessary site work including excavation, filling and grading according to approved plans has been completed to the required elevation in keeping with all of the requirements of the City of Mesquite comprehensive drainage ordinance, and the requirements as may have been outlined by the city council, at which time the city council may then finalize ordinance action to remove the FP prefix designation from the zoning district maps. 
Any dumping, excavation, storage or filling operations within that portion of a district having a FP prefix prior to the issuance of a "floodplain modification permit" as specified above is illegal, and such operation shall cease until such time the FP designation is removed in accordance with the above section and the City of Mesquite comprehensive drainage ordinance, which applicable sections are hereby made a part of this ordinance. 
C.  Responsibility for flooding. The fact that land or property is or is not within a district having a FP prefix shall not constitute assurance that such land or property is not subject to local flooding and the designation of the floodplain prefix in this ordinance shall not be so interpreted. 
D.  Special provisions. The director of community development may authorize filling operations to be conducted in any existing excavation, depression, or hole within that portion of a district having a FP prefix designation, provided the elevation of the proposed fill does not exceed the average of the contiguous floodplain elevations. 
Existing structures located in the FP district not provided for herein shall be nonconforming and any improvements thereto shall be in conformance with Section 1-300. 
The director of community development, by written permit, may authorize limited channel and site improvements in an FP district if it is determined by the city engineer that the channel and terrain flow characteristics are not significantly changed. In which case the area of FP prefix designation may be modified to the extent indicated by the improvements authorized by the director of community development as in other cases. This area should generally not exceed ten (10) percent of the FP portion on the lot.

Except in the case of such special restrictions all provisions of the other zoning district shall apply. Where there are conditions under which the required preservation of a historic landmark would cause undue hardship to the owner or owners, the owner(s) may request and the city council, after compliance with the zoning change procedures of the state law and the procedures of the historic preservation ordinance may approve or disapprove a change.

4-801 - Purpose and scope. 
    The Town East area has emerged as the major business center for eastern Dallas County. The pattern of growth in the area has created a concentration of retail and entertainment uses (restaurants and theaters) unforeseen at the time most of the area zoning was adopted. Because of the concentration of these uses, the orientation of the area to family services, the congestion of traffic, and the critical importance of the area in the city's tax structure, some modification of zoning regulation is deemed necessary to assure the on-going viability of the businesses and the value of their improvements. Through the adoption of an overlay district, selected regulations can be adjusted as needed without unnecessarily revising other aspects of the current zoning. The overlay approach therefore provides the least disruptive method of addressing the needed issues. 
    The overlay district will accommodate further development of retail, restaurants, theaters, and selected entertainment uses similar to the existing development. Diversification to office and hotel uses is encouraged both due to the synergy that the variety of uses can create, as well as for the differentiated traffic pattern created by these uses, i.e. traffic generated at times other than the current retail peaks. 
    On the other hand, the overlay will restrict uses which might be detrimental to the overall viability and integrity of the area. Specifically, uses with the following characteristics are restricted: 
1.  Uses which generate truck traffic or display other traffic characteristics which would create greater disruption in this area due to the already congested traffic conditions. 
2.  Uses with visual or aesthetic characteristics which are normally not present or desirable in a quality retail/entertainment area. 
3.  Uses with disruptive characteristics, which are generally only accommodated in heavy commercial areas, or which are generally incompatible with family- and customer-oriented retail and entertainment uses. 
(Ord. No. 3097, § 1, 6-17-96) 
4-802 - TERRA - Town East Retail and Restaurant Area Prefix. 
    The TERRA prefix designation constitutes a zoning overlay district, and the addition or removal of the TERRA prefix constitutes zoning action requiring due process required under state law. The city shall have only one contiguous Town East Retail and Restaurant Area District. 
(Ord. No. 3097, § 1, 6-17-96) 
4-803 - Permitted uses. 
    In this district, no land shall be used except for one or more of the following uses to the extent that they are not prohibited by other regulations and ordinances. 
A.  Standard district. All land in the overlay district shall retain its existing zoning designation and all characteristics of such zoning, except as modified herein. 
B.  Reserved. ] 
C.  Restricted uses. In the TERRA overlay, the following uses shall require approval of a conditional use permit in accordance with 5-300. When a use is allowed in the underlying existing zoning district by the schedule of permitted uses (3-203) as a permitted use or conditional use permit, application may be made in the TERRA overlay for approval as a conditional use permit. The restricted uses shall be indicated with an asterisk (*) on the schedule of permitted uses (3-203).

4-900 - MILITARY PARKWAY-SCYENE CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT 

4-901 - Purpose and scope. 
    The Military Parkway-Scyene Corridor is positioned centrally between the Mesquite Arena and Rodeo Entertainment District, the downtown and historic square area, and IH-635 and the rail line north of Scyene. The purpose of the MP-SC overlay district is to create an attractive and effective gateway into downtown and link these important assets and land uses. To this end, the MP-SC overlay district is intended to: 
 Provide for a selective palette of retail/entertainment uses while accommodating a limited mix of residential and service uses that compliment the retail development or that support pedestrian- and transit-oriented design. 
 Avoid familiar "strip" patterns of development by encouraging multi-use development on large or unified parcels that minimize access points, allow for three hundred sixty-degree design and reduce auto-dominated frontage. 
 Establish non-traditional setback, parking standards, lighting, signage and other site planning features that create a distinct and cognizable "sense of place" on Military Parkway and Scyene Road. 
 Encourage pedestrian activity on the street frontage, between major uses and with links to the parks and recreation trail system. 
 Preserve long-term opportunities for incorporating transit-oriented development. 
(Ord. No. 3846, § 1, 12-18-06)

C.  Site design and maintenance. The site of any proposed establishment within the MP-SC overlay district shall be designed and developed in accordance with this section in addition to all other requirements of the city's ordinances and in accordance with any and all design standards adopted by the city council specifically for the MP-SC overlay district and on file in the planning office when application is made for any proposed establishment. In the event of a conflict between this section and other provisions of the city's ordinances, this section shall prevail. In the event of a conflict between this section and the Design Standards adopted for the MP-SC overlay district, the design standards shall prevail. The board of adjustment is not authorized to grant relief from the provisions of this subsection. 
1.  In the front and exterior side yards, not less than seventy-five (75) percent of the building profile shall be built to the right-of-way line. For eating establishments other than drive-in restaurants or restaurants with drive-through facilities, the amount of the building profile built to the right-of-way line may be reduced below seventy-five (75) percent when: 
(a)  The area between the building facade and the right-of-way line is used for seating for the eating establishment; 
(b)  Ingress and egress are provided from the area to the interior of the eating establishment; and 
(c)  Not less than twenty-five (25) percent of the building profile is built to the right-of-way line. 
2.  Every establishment shall have not less than one (1) customer entrance on each street frontage.

4-905 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this ordinance, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section. The diagrams (Diagram 1, etc.) that illustrate various terms are considered part of the definition to which they refer. 
    Building profile means the apparent width of a building when viewed from the street. A development with multiple street frontages will have one (1) building profile for each frontage. (Diagram 1) 
    Building enclosure ratio refers to the proportionate relationship between the total distance between buildings on both sides of the adjacent street and the height of a building. (Diagram 2) 
    Director means the Director of Community Development or his designee. 
    Parking footprint means the area defined by the rear building facade(s) and the rear setback lines. (Diagram 3) 
    Parking profile means the apparent width of the parking area and access drives when viewed from the street. (Diagram 3) 
    Optimum width of street right-of-way refers to the planned or future right-of-way width as approved on the city's thoroughfare plan. 
    Shared parking benefit refers to a concession made for parking in a mixed-use development that has the effect of lowering the minimum parking requirement based upon variations in parking demand by time of day and land use relationships that induce single auto trips. The shared parking benefit is determined separately for each mixed-use development according to standards recommended by the Urban Land Institute. 
    Vertical mixed-use refers to stacking different uses on different floors of a multi-story building. 
    Walkway Assembly means enhanced pedestrian and landscape improvements installed in the public right-of-way (Diagram 4).

4-930 - SKYLINE LOGISTICS HUB OVERLAY DISTRICT 

4-931 - Purpose and scope. 
    The diverse manufacturing and distribution uses that congregate around the Big Town and Town East Boulevards, and that stretch from Interstate Highway 30 to Skyline Boulevard, form the heart of Mesquite's industrial sector. Businesses within the area depend primarily upon long-haul carriers for shipping and delivery to a degree not found anywhere else in the City. The purpose of the Skyline Logistics Hub Overlay District is to enhance the economic stature of the sector and deal with some of the externalities of such intense activity. To this end, the District is intended to: 
  Create identity for the concentration of industrial land uses within the area, and provide opportunities for transportation funding through programs that support industrial and economic development. 
  Recognize the importance of the area to the City's economic well-being, and preserve and encourage the further development of available land within the area for industry, which creates jobs and improves the tax base. 
  Protect through reasonable regulation the residential enclaves within and on the boundary of the area from the external impacts of heavy industry, trucking and land uses that support trucking activity. 
  Adopt responsible environmental and aesthetic measures to bring visual order, cleanliness and appeal to the Big Town Gateway in keeping with the industrial character of the area. 
(Ord. No. 4371(TA No. 2015-01), § 1(1), 7-20-15) 
4-932 - Skyline Logistics Hub Overlay District Prefix. 
    The SLH prefix designation is a zoning overlay district. After the effective date of this ordinance, the addition or removal of the SLH prefix constitutes zoning action requiring due process under State law.

4-950 - SHERWOOD FOREST OVERLAY DISTRICT 

4-951 - Purpose and scope. 
    On March 5, 2007, the Mesquite City Council adopted the Sherwood Forest Neighborhood Plan. The Plan contains strategies to modify the preferred locations for retail use and preserve the prevailing residential site design and architectural standards of the neighborhood. The purpose of the Sherwood Forest Overlay District is to implement the strategies of the Plan with minimal disruption to the basic regulatory fabric that already exists for the area. To this end, the SF Overlay District is intended to: 
 Accommodate a limited mix of neighborhood-oriented commercial and service uses along Scyene Road that compliment the residential core of the neighborhood. 
 Amend certain non-residential construction, parking, landscaping and signage standards within the zoning districts that impact Sherwood Forest. 
 Amend obsolete design standards in undeveloped planned developments districts that are incompatible with adjacent residential subdivisions. 
 Maintain the distinct character of the residential core with infill housing that is architecturally compatible. 
(Ord. No. 3914, § 1, 11-19-07) 
4-952 - Sherwood Forest Overlay District Prefix.

4-1000 - TRUMAN HEIGHTS NEIGHBORHOOD FORM-BASED DISTRICT 

4-1001 - Purpose and scope. 
    The core of the Truman Heights neighborhood is located in the triangle between N. Galloway Avenue on the west, U.S. Highway 80, and Hillcrest Avenue on the south. In March 2007, the City Council adopted the Truman Heights Neighborhood Plan as a revitalization strategy for improving the neighborhood. Truman Heights is part of a larger, yet walkable, neighborhood sustainability zone that encompasses an adjacent commercial corridor on both sides of N. Galloway Avenue in addition to the neighborhood's residential core. 
    The purpose of the Truman Heights Neighborhood zoning district is to integrate the residential functions and supporting commercial services in a form that increases buildable densities in a pedestrian-oriented, visually attractive environment. With an emphasis on form, rather than the separation of land uses, the district not only encourages, but also mandates building disposition and configuration in a manner that is unique in the City of Mesquite. In doing so, the district is designed to preserve the character of the neighborhood's residential core with contextual infill standards and provide a straightforward, visual prescription for revitalization of the N. Galloway corridor. 
(Ord. No. 3911, § 1(2), 11-5-07) 
4-1002 - Truman Heights Neighborhood district. 
    The THN zoning classification is a mixed-use district that stands separate and apart from all other zoning districts in the city. It is not an overlay district. The city shall have only one (1) contiguous Truman Heights Neighborhood District. 
(Ord. No. 3911, § 1(2), 11-5-07) 
4-1003 - Truman Heights Revitalization Code. 
    From and after November 5, 2007, the uses and buildings on all land rezoned to THN shall conform exclusively to the Truman Heights Revitalization Code, adopted concurrent with the creation of the THN district and as subsequently amended, and which is incorporated herein as if set forth in full. 
(Ord. No. 3911, § 1(2), 11-5-07; Ord. No. 4187, § 1, 11-7-11) 
4-1020 - NORTH GUS THOMASSON CORRIDOR FORM-BASED DISTRICT 

4-1021 - Purpose and scope. 
    The North Gus Thomasson Corridor is a commercial corridor adjacent to the Casa View Heights neighborhood, which is situated generally northwest of the intersection of Gus Thomasson Road and Oates Drive. In April 2007, the city council adopted the Casa View Heights Neighborhood Plan that included strategies for reconnecting the residential core of the neighborhood with the Gus Thomasson commercial area and revitalizing the corridor. Both the commercial corridor and the Casa View Heights neighborhood are part of a walkable neighborhood sustainability zone that encompasses properties fronting Gus Thomasson Road north from Interstate Highway 30 to the Mesquite city limits. 
    The purpose of the North Gus Thomasson Corridor zoning district is to integrate residential and neighborhood-scaled commercial functions in a form that increases buildable densities in a pedestrian-oriented, visually attractive environment. With an emphasis on form, rather than the separation of land uses, the district not only encourages, but also mandates building disposition and configuration in a manner that is unique in the City of Mesquite. In doing so, the district is designed to provide a straightforward, visual prescription for revitalization of the North Gus Thomasson corridor over time. 
(Ord. No. 4022, § 1(2), 12-15-08) 
4-1022 - North Gus Thomasson Corridor District. 
    The NGTC zoning classification is a mixed-use district that stands separate and apart from all other zoning districts in the city. It is not an overlay district. The city shall have only one (1) contiguous North Gus Thomasson Corridor District. 
(Ord. No. 4022, § 1(2), 12-15-08) 
4-1023 - North Gus Thomasson revitalization code. 
    From and after December 15, 2008, the uses and buildings on all land rezoned to NGTC shall conform exclusively to the North Gus Thomasson Corridor Revitalization Code, adopted concurrent with the creation of the NGTC district and as subsequently amended, and which is incorporated herein as if set forth in full. 
(Ord. No. 4022, § 1(2), 12-15-08; Ord. No. 4187, § 1, 11-7-11) 
4-1100 - KAUFMAN-INTERSTATE 20 FORM-BASED DISTRICT 

4-1101 - Purpose and scope. 
    On August 21, 2006, the city annexed 2.2 square miles of sparsely inhabited greenfield territory situated in Kaufman County. The newly annexed territory is centered on the Interstate 20 corridor. Annexation of the area was preceded by a year-long study of the economic impacts of growth in the corridor. The study concluded that annexation could produce a net positive economic benefit for the city if residential and commercial growth occurred in an orderly manner and at certain requisite densities. The territory was annexed into the city under the default Agricultural zoning classification pending the development of a plan for fiscally supportable growth and the adoption of regulatory controls to implement the plan. By the time the planning process began in the spring of 2007, new concerns were surfacing over the price of oil and its effect upon conventional suburban lifestyles, the pressing need to reshape the city's image through quality development and the challenges of taking joint responsibility to prepare the region for a more sustainable future. The Comprehensive Plan Element for the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction ("the ETJ Plan") adopted by the city council on August 4, 2008, addresses these issues and many more. 
    The purpose of the Kaufman - Interstate 20 (K20) District is to provide the first tier of regulations designed to implement the ETJ Plan. As new development occurs, the K20 district is uniquely crafted to guide that development in a manner that is consistent with the goals and strategic policies of the ETJ Plan. The district uses principles of the SmartCode &reg; to funnel development into growth sectors of varying intensity in locations identified by the ETJ Plan. Within each sector, the district prescribes certain community types in an effort to foster the creation of walkable, complete neighborhoods. Development proceeds upon approval of a regulating plan built around transect zones that are SmartCode &reg; allocated according to each community type. Form standards ensure that buildings and streets contribute to a pedestrian-oriented, visually attractive environment. As the regulating plan is built out over time, the result is a place that is distinctive, less auto-dependent and mixed use, populated by housing that offers income and generational diversity. 
(Ord. No. 3984, § 1(3), 9-2-08) 
4-1102 - Kaufman-Interstate 20 District. 
    The K20 zoning classification is a floating district that attaches to a parcel or parcels only upon approval of a regulating plan by the city council. It is not an overlay district. The following properties shall be subject to the application of the K20 district: 
A.  All land within the city limits of the City of Mesquite that are situated east of the East Fork of the Trinity River; 
B.  Other land designated by the city council for development as a clustered land development (CLD), traditional neighborhood development (TND), town center development (TCD) or regional center development (RCD) (east of the Mesquite Airport as depicted in the ETJ Plan) in accordance with principles of the SmartCode &reg; ; 
C.  New territory annexed into the City of Mesquite for either full or limited purposes; and 
D.  Land within the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction pursuant to a development agreement with the landowner. 
(Ord. No. 3984, § 1(3), 9-2-08) 
4-1103 - K20 interim development code. 
    After the effective date of this ordinance [section], and except as modified herein, all new subdivisions, development and new land uses on property enumerated in section 4-1102 as subject to the application of the K20 district shall conform exclusively to the Kaufman-Interstate 20 Interim Development Code, adopted concurrent with the creation of the K20 district, and which is incorporated herein as if set forth in full. Property that is zoned agricultural on the date that it becomes subject to the application of the K20 district may continue to be developed and used according to the terms of the AG district, provided that this exception shall not apply to the subdivision of land into one (1) or more tracts of less than five (5) acres for residential use or when subdivision of the property requires installation of a street under the subdivision ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 3984, § 1(3), 9-2-08) 
4-1500 - TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD MIXED RESIDENTIAL (TNMR) DISTRICT 

4-1501 - Purpose and scope. 
    Historically multifamily development has been viewed as inimical to single-family neighborhoods. Multifamily uses were walled-off from neighborhoods and employed as transitional land uses to shield neighborhoods from commercial corridors. The purpose of the Traditional Neighborhood Mixed Residential (TNMR) zoning district is to create communities consisting of multifamily housing and other housing types that are well-designed and integrated into the surrounding neighborhood. Using familiar form-based concepts such as enclosure, walkability, connectivity, complete streets and step-down density, the district seeks to expand housing choice in a traditional pedestrian-scaled development that builds on, supports and reconnects the existing urban fabric. In that sense, the TNMR district is not only appropriate but highly desirable for infill locations. 
(Ord. No. 4098, § 1(5), 6-7-10; Ord. No. 4122, § 1(4), 12-6-10) 
4-1502 - Site plan required. 
A.  All development within the TNMR district shall comply with a site plan approved in accordance with the City's procedural and substantive requirements for site plan review. In addition to all other submittal requirements, a site plan for development within the TNMR district shall include the following: 
1.  Designation of all building types 
2.  Designation of all frontage types 
3.  Location, number and dimension of any on-street parking spaces 
4.  Right-of-way improvements including sidewalks, street trees, etc. 
5.  All open spaces and any improvements within the open spaces 
B.  Upon written request of the applicant, the Director of Community Development ("Director") may, but shall not be required to, permit a practice that is not consistent with or covered by a specific provision of the TNMR district but is justified by its intent. The Director's decision to approve a request, in whole or in part, shall be made in writing and made a permanent part of the final site plan. 
(Ord. No. 4098, § 1(5), 6-7-10; Ord. No. 4122, § 1(4), 12-6-10) 
4-1503 - Permitted building types. 
A.  All development shall include a minimum of two (2) building types from the list below not including accessory units and mixed use buildings. Each building type provided (excluding accessory units and mixed use buildings) shall constitute a minimum of ten (10) percent of the dwelling units found within the development. Each building type is limited to specific frontage types as found in parentheses following the building type. 
Apartment building (Gallery, arcade, doorway, front yard, forecourt, common lawn) Townhouse (Doorway, dooryard, terrace/light court, front yard, common lawn) Flat over flat-Duplex (Front yard, common lawn) Paired house-Duplex (Front yard, common lawn) Single-family detached house (Front yard, common lawn) Accessory unit (Dependent upon main structure) Mixed use building (Storefront, gallery, arcade) - mixed use buildings permitted on corner lots only

(Ord. No. 4098, § 1(5), 6-7-10) 
4-1504 - Setback requirements. 
A.  Except as required for step-down design in Section 4-1505, the setback requirements in the TNMR district shall be determined by the frontage type. 
1.  Gallery, doorway and arcade frontage types: 
a.  Front setback: Zero feet maximum. 
b.  Gallery or arcade columns: Three (3) feet from curb maximum. 
c.  Side setback: Ten (10) feet maximum. 
d.  Rear setback: 
i.  With rear alley: Five (5) feet maximum or sixteen (16) feet minimum.

(Ord. No. 2667, 4-2-90; Ord. No. 3923, § 1, 12-17-07) 
5-203 - Criteria for review. 
A.  Criteria for special exceptions. Special exceptions may be granted as set out in this ordinance, when the board determines that the exception will allow greater use and enjoyment of property without creating adverse impacts on adjacent properties and that it will be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. The board shall also consider any criteria set out in this ordinance for a specific special exception. 
B.  Criteria for variances. Variances from the terms of this ordinance which will not be contrary to the public interest may be granted where, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed and substantial justice is done. The board shall consider whether: 
1.  Special conditions: Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land or improvements thereto and which are not applicable to other lands or improvements thereto in the same district. 
2.  Unnecessary hardship: Literal interpretation of the provisions of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship to the owner of the property. 
3.  Not self-imposed: The special conditions and circumstances are not self-imposed, i.e. do not result from the actions of the applicant or owner. 
C.  Special exceptions for the handicapped. It is the express intent of the City Council to comply with the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, as amended, and to ensure that all handicapped persons have equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. This section allows a person to seek relief from the enforcement of any regulation contained in this chapter that would result in illegal discrimination against the handicapped. This section does not authorize the Board to grant a change in the use of a building or structure. 
    The Board shall grant a special exception to any regulation in this chapter if, after a public hearing, the Board finds that the exception is necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The term "handicapped person" means a person with a "handicap," as that term is defined in the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, as amended. The Board may impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of this special exception consistent with the purpose stated in this section. 
(Ord. No. 2667, 4-2-90; Ord. No. 4400, § 1(3), 11-2-15) 
5-204 - Board action. 
A.  Action authorized. 
1.  Special exceptions and variances: The board may deny or approve a request for special exception or variance. The board may impose reasonable conditions and limitations to an approval in order to further the purposes and intent of this ordinance. 
2.  Appeals interpretations: The board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the administrative official's order, requirement, decision or determination form which an appeal is taken and make the correct order, requirement, decision or determination, and for that purpose the board has the same authority as the administrative official. 
B.  Effect of decisions. The Board's decision is final unless appealed to the district court within 10 days in accordance with Chapter 211 of the Texas Local Government Code. 
C.  Resubmission. The submission of an application previously determined by the board shall not be permitted, unless the board's determination on the application specifically states that its determination is made "without prejudice". Except that, where extenuating circumstances exist, an applicant previously denied may appear before the board to request that resubmittal of their application be permitted. Extenuating circumstances shall mean changed conditions or facts which will substantially alter the criteria for review of the application. This section shall not prohibit the submission of a new application which contains meaningful revisions for consideration. Meaningful revisions shall mean a substantial change in the size, location, or other physical characteristic of the subject of the application. 
D.  Limitation on approval. The applicant shall file an application for a building permit or Certificate of Occupancy on or before the expiration of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of favorable board action, unless an extended period is specifically granted by the board. If the applicant fails to file such application within the time period, the request is automatically denied without prejudice and a new application must be made. 
(Ord. No. 2667, 4-2-90; Ord. No. 3151, § 1, 4-21-97; Ord. No. 4136, § 1, 3-21-11; Ord. No. 4400, § 1(4), 11-2-15) 
5-300 - AMENDMENT AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT PROCEDURES 
    The city council may from time to time, after receiving a final report thereon from the planning and zoning commission, amend, supplement or change the regulations herein provided or the boundaries of the zoning districts, subject to compliance with the following amendment procedures. Approval of a conditional use permit constitutes an amendment and requires compliance with the following procedures. 

5-301 - Application. 
A.  Initiation. Consideration for a change of zoning classification, boundary, or regulation, and requests for approval of a conditional use permit may be initiated in the following manner: 
1.  City: By direction of the commission, city council or city planner. 
2.  Property owner: By application of the owner of the property on which a district boundary change is requested or by an authorized agent, provided that the owner indicates his consent in writing. 
3.  Others: Persons having no ownership interest in the land and not having the owner's consent shall not be permitted to initiate an application to change the boundaries or classification on such land. Such parties may petition the commission, in writing or by spokesperson, requesting that the commission initiate an application. The commission shall consider the time elapsed since the last zoning action on the property, any substantial changes in conditions in the area since the last zoning action, the relationship of current zoning and the requested action to the city's comprehensive plan/development policies, and other facts and reasons presented. If the commission determines that the potential for adverse impacts on surrounding property and for incompatibility of development due to changed conditions is greater than at other locations where similar uses abut or are in close proximity to each other, it may initiate an application in order to afford a full hearing on the matter. If the commission declines to initiate an application, no similar nonowner petition shall be considered for a period of one (1) year. 
B.  Application form and map. A zoning change or conditional use permit request shall be submitted on an application form as provided by the planning division and shall state the specific zoning classification desired. A planimetric map, boundary survey, or other map, adequate to accurately identify and locate the property in question shall be submitted with the application form. 
C.  Application fee. The applicant shall submit with the application a fee in the amount set by the City Council for the purpose of defraying the administrative costs of processing. If an applicant causes his/her application to be continued or tabled, thus requiring new notification, the applicant shall be charged an additional fee of 30 percent of the original application fee. No fee or portion thereof shall be refunded after notices on the application have been issued. 
(Ord. No. 2667, 4-2-90; Ord. No. 4400, § 1(5), 11-2-15) 
5-302 - Procedures. 
A.  Commission public hearing and notification. Prior to making its report to the city council, the commission shall hold at least one (1) public hearing on each application. 
1.  Proposed changes in district classification or boundaries/conditional use permits: Before the tenth day before the date of the hearing, written notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be sent to each owner of real property within two hundred (200) feet of the property which is subject of the application, as such ownership is indicated by the most recently approved municipal tax roll. The notice may be served by its deposit, properly addressed with postage paid, in the United States mail. 
2.  Proposed changes in text: Before the fifteenth day before the date of the hearing, notice of the time and place of the hearing on proposed changes in regulations and/or the text of the Zoning Ordinance shall be published in the official newspaper of the City or a newspaper of general circulation in the City. 
B.  Commission recommendation. The commission, after holding the public hearing, shall prepare its recommendations on the proposed changes and forward the same to the city council. 
C.  Appeal of commission denial. When the recommendation of the commission is for denial of the application, it shall be presumed that the applicant declines a hearing before the city council unless written request is made to the city secretary, appealing the commission recommendation and requesting a council hearing. 
D.  Council public hearing and notification. The City Council shall hold at least one (1) public hearing on each application. Before the fifteenth day before the date of the hearing, notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the City or a newspaper of general circulation in the City. 
(Ord. No. 2667, 4-2-90; Ord. No. 4188, § 1, 11-7-11) 
5-303 - Conditional use permits. 
A.  Purpose and scope. The purpose of the conditional use permit process is to identify those uses which might be appropriate within a zoning district, but due to either their locational, functional, or operational nature, could have a potentially negative impact upon surrounding properties or upon the city as a whole; and to provide a procedure whereby such uses might be permitted, where appropriate, by further restricting or conditioning them so as to eliminate the probable and potential negative impacts. 
B.  Review criteria. In reviewing a request for conditional use permit approval, the city council shall consider: 
1.  Existing uses: That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate area for purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the immediate vicinity. 
2.  Vacant properties: That the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding vacant property for uses predominant in area. 
3.  Services: That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and other necessary facilities have been or are being provided. Conditional uses in residential districts shall generally require direct access to an arterial street. 
4.  Parking: That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide sufficient off-street parking and loading spaces to serve the proposed uses. 
5.  Performance standards: That adequate measures have been or will be taken to prevent or control offensive odor, fumes, dust, noise, and vibration, so that none of these will constitute a nuisance and to control lighted signs and other lights in such a manner that no disturbance to neighboring properties will result. 
C.  Termination. All conditional use permits approved prior to the date of passage of this section and all conditional use permits approved after the date of passage shall automatically terminate if the conditions set out below occur. Extension of the approved period may be requested at any time prior to termination or within sixty (60) days after termination. When it is determined that no significant changes affecting the conditional use permit have occurred, the city council may, after recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, extend the approval. All approvals and extensions shall be valid for one year from the date of action, unless the City Council specifies a greater or lesser period. 
1.  Failure to implement: Approval of the conditional use permit shall automatically terminate one year after the date of the ordinance granting the conditional use permit, unless a building permit or a certificate of occupancy has been issued for the use. 
2.  Discontinuance: Approval of the conditional use permit shall automatically terminate if the use is abandoned or is discontinued for a period of six (6) months or more. 
D.  The city council may stipulate conditions and limitations on the approval of the Conditional Use Permit in the interest of public welfare and to assure that the intent of this ordinance is carried out. 
1.  Conditions. The approval of a conditional use permit may place stipulations or conditions on the operation, location, arrangement or construction of a conditional use permit in order to assure the protection of adjacent properties and uses in the vicinity and to safeguard the welfare of the citizenry as a whole as it may be affected by the use. 
2.  Time limits. A time limit may be imposed as a condition of the approval of a conditional use permit when the city council determines that one of the following circumstances exists: 
a.  The use is presented by the applicant as a temporary or interim use or the use, due to its nature and operation, may be considered temporary or interim, so that removal of the use is reasonably to be expected after a period of time. Temporary or interim use may be indicated by leasing of land or building space, by minimal construction of property improvements or by the lack of construction customized for the specific use. 
b.  The use is consistent with current uses in the area and on adjoining property; however, anticipated future changes in the area would cause the requested use to become incompatible after a period of time. 
When no time limit is proposed by the applicant, but the Council finds that the use is not appropriate without such condition, then the Council shall inquire of the applicant if a time limit is an acceptable condition. If such condition is unacceptable to the applicant, the Council shall deny the application. 
When a conditional use permit is to expire due to an imposed time limit and the property owner wishes to continue the use, a new application shall be submitted requesting to continue the conditional use permit. Such applications shall require the same procedures outlined herein for initial approval of a conditional use permit. 
3.  Transferability. A conditional use permit shall be transferable between owners and businesses except as follows: where the city council finds that a use or uses defined and permitted under a conditional use permit are sufficiently unusual in character or operation as to create the potential for variations in function or operation with possible negative impacts upon adjacent properties or on the citizenry as a whole, the city council may specify in its approval that the conditional use permit is approved solely for the business represented by the applicant and that the conditional use permit shall not be transferable to a different person or business. 
A different business applicant desiring to continue a non-transferable conditional use permit shall submit a new application requesting to continue the conditional use permit. Such applications shall require the same procedures outlined herein for initial approval of a conditional use permit. 
(Ord. No. 2667, 4-2-90; Ord. No. 3032, § 1, 5-1-95; Ord. No. 3459, § 1, 8-15-01) 
5-304 - City council action. 
A.  Action authorized. The city council may sustain or reverse the recommendation of the commission by a simple majority vote, except when a three-quarter (3/4) majority vote is required as noted below. 
    A favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all members of the city council shall be required to approve any amendment when the proposed change is protested, as provided by state law, by the owners of twenty (20) percent of the area covered by the proposed change or of the area immediately adjoining and extending two hundred (200) feet from the subject area. 
B.  Resubmission. No application on the same request shall be permitted within one (1) year of the council hearing, or commission hearing when a denial is not appealed, unless the commission shall determine that extenuating circumstances exist. A notation of "denied without prejudice" on the minutes of the prior action on an application shall be evidence of the existence of extenuating circumstances and resubmission shall be permitted. 
C.  Ordinance preparation and adoption. Upon approval of the request by the council, authorizing the preparation of an ordinance, the applicant shall, on or before the expiration of ninety (90) days from the council hearing/approval, unless an extended period is specifically granted by the council, provide field notes and a map of a survey of the property on eight and one-half (81/2) by eleven (11) sheets. Upon receipt of adequate filed notes, an ordinance shall be prepared and schedule for adoption. If an applicant fails to provide the required property description within the time period, the previous action by the council is null and void, unless an extended period shall be granted by the council.
